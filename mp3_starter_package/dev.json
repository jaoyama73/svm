{"data": ["AT&amp;T Corp. said Thursday it set an alliance with Shaklee Corp. that will allow Shaklee's 500,000 sales agents to sell AT&amp;T residential calling plans face-to-face with customers at home.\nThe alliance is called Shaklee Connections and is expected to reach millions of new customers in 1997 and beyond, AT&amp;T said. No financial details were disclosed.\n\"Without question, this is a groundbreaking move for AT&amp;T,\" said Joseph Nacchio, executive vice president of AT&amp;T's consumer and small business division.\nShaklee, part of Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Japan, sells nutritional supplements, personal care products, household cleaners, and water treatment products.\n\"Shaklee will help us expand our personal presence in communities exponentially and create a whole new network of representatives with roots in neighbourhoods across the country,\" Nacchio said.\nShaklee's independent sales agents will be eligible to become authorised AT&amp;T distributors and will be AT&amp;T customers themselves. They will begin marketing in the first quarter of 1997.\nAT&amp;T is taking a page from the books of its smaller competitors by adopting a so-called multi-level marketing campaign.\nAnalysts have watched with interest as a number of small resellers of consumer long-distance service, notably Excel Communications Inc., have taken a bite out of AT&amp;T's customer base by using independent sales agents to sell to customers at their homes or in other one-on-one settings.\nAT&amp;T's market share in the $70 billion long-distance market has sunk to about 55 percent from 90 percent over the last decade, analysts estimated, and small, aggressive resellers like Excel are among those taking away customers.\nThere are 1,000 resellers of long-distance service in the United States. They do not own networks but buy wholesale capacity on networks owned by companies like AT&amp;T and WorldCom Inc.\n", "Gail McGovern, AT&amp;T Corp.'s new executive vice president for the consumer and small business division, is new to the big challenge facing her: boosting AT&amp;T's share in the consumer long-distance market.\nLike her boss, Chief Operating Officer John Walter, McGovern has made a reputation in a different area but will bring a fresh approach, analysts said Monday.\n\"Gail is very experienced, but her experience is on the business side, and AT&amp;T is facing the bigger challenges on the consumer side,\" said Richard Klugman of brokerage PaineWebber.\nMcGovern, 44, was named to succeed Joseph Nacchio, who is leaving AT&amp;T to join Qwest Communications Corp., a small telecommunications company in Denver, as chief executive.\nShe said in an interview Monday that her top priority would be to improve revenue growth and to retain customers.\n\"I can tell you that focusing on reducing churn will be a top priority in 1997,\" she said in an interview.\nAs the most senior woman AT&amp;T has ever employed, McGovern will be responsible for more than half the company's revenues.\nShe expects to apply the same packaging of services to suit consumer customers that she has done in the business market. A single bill for a variety of services will help show the simplicity of offerings, she said.\n\"Billing is an essential ingredient,\" McGovern said.\nAT&amp;T, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., has seen its market share in the $80-billion-a-year long-distance market dwindle from a near-monopoly when a federal judge ordered its divestiture in 1984 to around 55 percent today, according to analysts' estimates.\nApart from MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp., AT&amp;T has recently faced competition from a host of small yet aggressive long-distance companies like LCI International Inc. and Excel Communications Inc..\nAT&amp;T has been able to attract consumer customers, at a cost, but has had trouble retaining them.\nAnalysts who have met her had little doubt McGovern would be up to the task, after winning back major corporate contracts, including IBM Corp., McGraw-Hill Cos. Inc. and Textron Inc..\n\"She's very bright and very quick,\" said Richard Toole of brokers Merrill Lynch and Co. She has fewer rough edges than Nacchio. Joe was unique, and streetwise, but could be a little brutal,\" he said.\nWalter, who was appointed as chief operating officer in October, takes over from Robert Allen as chief executive in May at AT&amp;T's shareholders meeting. McGovern's appointment was his first visible mark on AT&amp;T.\n\"I see his hands on this promotion, though she was a star to begin with,\" Toole said.\nIn the interview, McGovern said tying in satellite TV services and other forms of marketing was a great way of reaching new markets.\nAT&amp;T has a stake in Hughes Electronic Corp.'s DirecTV direct broadcast satellite venture, and in November set a deal with Shaklee Corp. under which their 500 sales representatives will talk to potential customers about AT&amp;T services.\n\"We have to explore as many indirect sales channels as possible,\" McGovern said.\n", "There will be many more places to hang your hat in cyberspace soon, thanks to a plan adopted by the Internet Society and a host of other groups, the society announced Tuesday.\nThe group, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, said the plan would provide seven new top-level domains, the last three letters at the end of every electronic mail or Web site address.\nComputer maker Digital Equipment Corp., telecommunications company MCI Communications Corp. and UUNET Technologies Inc., a unit of Worldcom Inc., endorsed the plan, first unveiled in February, the society said.\nThe plan also has been endorsed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards operating under a charter from the society and the Federal Network Council.\nThe International Telecommunications Union, World Intellectual Property Organization and International Trademark Association backed the plan as well, the society said.\nUnder the plan, new domain names such as \"firm,\" \"arts,\" and \"web\" will be added to the existing top-level domains such as \"com,\" \"net,\" and \"org\" starting in the third quarter of 1997, the society said.\nThe plan establishes an arbitration and mediation procedure for resolving disputes over names, such as when a trademarked name is used in an Internet address.\nLast year, for example, toymaker Hasbro Inc. won a lawsuit to regain control of the address \"candyland.com,\" which was being used for an adult Web site with nude photographs. But more complex disputes arise when both parties may have a legitimate claim to an address name.\n\"Responsible self-governance is the key factor in assuring that the Internet will reach its fullest potential,\" Internet Society President Donald Heath said.\nAlthough other groups have tried to establish alternate domain names, they have not succeeded in persuading the vast majority of Internet service providers to add their new names to the computers that route information across the network.\nThe Internet Society plan met the needs of major providers.\n\"The Internet is growing up rapidly and it is vital that the processes, procedures and policies that define its adminstration be sound, stable and sustainable in an international setting,\" MCI Senior Vice President Vincent Cerf said.\nMCI is a top operator of the Internet's backbone network.\nCurrently, one company, Network Solutions Inc., registers addresses under most existing top-level domains under a contract with the National Science Foundation. Under the plan, up to 28 new registration agents will be chosen in a process overseen by the Big Six accounting firm Arthur Andersen.\nBut Network Solutions Senior Vice President Don Telage said having so many registrars would create chaos on the Net.\n\"This plan risks the stability of the Internet,\" he said.\nThe current system functions \"pretty well\" without international arbitration procedures, Telage said, noting his company has registered 1.2 million addresses and been sued only 26 times.\nHerndon, Va.-based Network Solutions will come out with its own plan soon for reforming the domain name registration system, Telage added.\nWhile Network Solutions charges $100 for a two-year registration, the new firms will be free to compete on price. All names will be maintained in a central, shared database.\nOnce Network Solution's contract with the National Science Foundation expires, the top-level domains it registers will be opened to all the other registry agents.\nA broad range of Internet companies and organizations will gather in Geneva at the end of April to add their formal endorsements on a memorandum of understanding, Heath said.\n", "Tate &amp; Lyle Plc said Tuesday its U.S. subsidiary A.E. Staley continues to face reduced profit margins for high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener.\nFructose contract prices for 1997, which largely have been set, are lower than a year ago, as are corn costs, said Larry Pillard, chief executive of London-based Tate &amp; Lyle.\n\"On a margin basis (factoring out corn cost changes) they are maybe slightly lower,\" Pillard told Reuters at an analysts' conference here.  \nPillard blamed lower margins on overcapacity in the U.S. fructose industry. Staley's output accounts for a little over 20 percent of total U.S. fructose production.\nTo balance the softness in fructose margins, Staley has shifted some output to other corn-based products, including ethanol, starch used by the paper industry, and specialty food starches.  \n\"In addition to that, we've continued our very aggressive cost-reduction initiatives at Staley,\" Pillard said. \"Yes, we'd like higher margins in fructose. But we're not completely dissatisfied with Staley. We're still very bullish on the corn refining business.\"\nHe added that U.S. fructose demand continues to grow by four to five percent a year.\nPillard acknowledged that \"in a worst case scenario\" it may be another two or three years before demand in the U.S. catches up with fructose supplies.  \nBut one promising variable is the potential for greater demand for fructose in Mexico.\nBeyond fructose, Tate &amp; Lyle is investing in number of value-added products, including a lactic acid plant it likely will build in the United States and a citric acid joint venture in India.\nTate &amp; Lyle, as a producer of sweeteners and starches, is already expanding its global presence, with investments in developing markets.\nThose investments, which have totaled $250 million over the past few years and spread over four continents -- is projected to generate a return on invesment of over 20 percent after five years, according to Simon Gifford, group finance director for Tate &amp; Lyle.\nInvestments have been made in Mexico, central and eastern Europe, Asia and Africa.\nTate &amp; Lyle also is building a world-scale starch plant in northern France, which will use wheat as a raw material.\n\"That will be completed by the end of this calendar year,\" Gifford said. \"We will start getting returns after commissioning in the second half of next year.\"\n\t ((Chicago newsdesk 312 408-8787))\n", "The Toronto stock market edged higher to reach the year's ninth record close in heavy trading on Tuesday, aided by the continued flow of money into tax-sheltered pension funds.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's key Composite Index rose 20.62 points to end at 6238.22, which was also a new intraday high.\nTurnover was unusually heavy with 138.47 million shares traded worth C$2.52 billion, the TSE's second highest value ever.\n\"We're in the RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) season in Canada,\" said Ira Katzin, investment advisor at RBC Dominion Securities. Canadians are scrambling to sock away savings in tax-sheltered pension plans before the March 1 deadline.\nAfter market close, Canada's Finance Minister Paul Martin presented his 1997/98 budget after market close with few new surprises for equities, said Fred Ketchen, ScotiaMcLeod's senior vice-president.\nMartin announced an extension for the special tax on banks -- a surcharge of 12 percent of capital tax -- until October 31, 1998.\nOf Toronto's 14 sub-indices, only four slipped: real estate, pipelines, base metals and oils. The gaining groups were led by golds, media, retail and banks.\nAdvances outnumbered declines 539 to 469 while another 275 traded unchanged.\nIn individual issues, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. lost 2.20 to 20.80 on almost 10 million shares while Barrick Gold Corp. shares rose 1.45 to 35.50 on 1.5 million shares.\nUncertainty still surrounds gold prospector Bre-X even though it recently cut a deal with U.S.-based Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. to develop the huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia. Barrick was shut out of a potential partnership.\nUnder the deal, Bre-X's stake will drop to 45 percent from 90 percent. Freeport will own 15 percent and Indonesian interests will grab 40 percent.\nAbitibi-Price Inc. rose 0.45 to 23.55 after being upgraded to market outperform from market perform by brokerage Goldman Sachs.\nThe forestry products firm agreed to merge with Stone-Consolidated Corp. last week, creating the world's largest newsprint maker on an almost two-to-one basis. Stone shares rose 0.25 to 23.60 in light trading.\n", "The unexpected departure of CompuServe Corp's CEO Robert Massey may portend further woes at the second largest online service, and deeper-than-expected financial losses are one possibility, analysts said Tuesday.\nOn Monday, a holiday in the U.S., CompuServe said that Massey had resigned, effective immediately, and that Massey wants to \"pursue other interests.\" The troubled online service is expected to report a loss on Thursday, when it is due to report third quarter earnings.\nThe First Call consensus is for a loss of $0.16 a share.  \n\"When a top guy leaves right before earnings, you can expect a disappointment or a restructuring,\" said Abhishek Gami, an analyst with Nesbitt Burns Securities. \"Maybe it will be worse than expected, but I think the expectations are already low.\" CompuServe shares were off 7/16 to 10-3/8.\nCompuServe has had a rough year, with increasingly intense competition from the leader America Online Inc.\n\"It is unfortunate timing, in that it was so close to earnings, because that always encourages people to connect the dots,\" said a CompuServe spokesman. \"But in this case, the dots aren't really there. It's all really speculation.\"  \nCompuServe said that Massey decided to leave for personal reasons, saying it has been a tough year, and that he wants to take a break from the prodigious hours he has been working.\n\"Clearly there are also pressures for CompuServe to return to profitability, that's no secret,\" the spokesman added. \"But there is no direct cause and effect there.\"\nThe CompuServe spokesman also said that the Columbus, Ohio-based company has in the past issued a warning when its earnings will come in below Wall Street's expectations. It has not issued any such warnings in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Massey said its financial position had improved.  \nBut Massey declined to say when CompuServe might return to profitability.\nStill, analysts said more bad news could come in the form of flat or even slower subscriber growth, at a time when rival AOL's subscriber base continues to soar, or perhaps from a disappointment in its successful network services division.\n\"He jumped before he got pushed,\" said Gary Arlen, an analyst with Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md. \"Their membership base is pretty flat. Their growth has been negligible, especially in a world where beleaguered AOL was adding hundreds of thousands of subscribers.\"  \nArlen said that CompuServe has gained new members as a direct result of AOL's recent network problems, but that these new members are \"negligible.\"\nIn November, CompuServe exited its Wow! consumer business, a flat-rate, family-oriented service that it had unveiled with much fanfare. CompuServe said that the flat-rate pricing was not profitable and it will continue to focus on the hobbyists, small businesses and corporate users of its online service.\n\"Now at least they are focused on the business market,\" said Kate Delhagen, a Forrester Research analyst. \"H&amp;R Block seems to think they need an overhaul.\"  \nH&amp;R Block Inc still owns about 80 percent of CompuServe, since it went public last April at $30 a share.\nFrank Salizzoni, president and CEO of H&amp;R Block, will act as an interim CEO of CompuServe, until another executive is found. CompuServe said that it has hired an executive search firm to help it locate external candidates, but it is also looking inside the company.\n\"We want to proceed at a brisk pace,\" the spokesman said, when asked if CompuServe has a specific deadline to replace Massey. \"It's more important to get the right person than to get someone quickly.\"  \nSalomon Brothers analyst Marc Usem said in a report to clients that while the short-term effect of Massey's departure is negative, it may work to CompuServe's advantage.\n\"A more aggressive, marketing oriented CEO may improve the company's online service prospects,\" Usem wrote in a note to clients, where he reiterated a buy rating on CompuServe. He said that CompuServe's Network Services unit alone is worth $8.50 to $10.20 a share.\nAnalysts said that while CompuServe has been hurt by AOL's success, many of the proprietary online services have closed or have seen problems as the Internet becomes more popular.\n", "The Clinton administration has crafted a plan to reform what many call outdated U.S. banking laws and will begin making its positions known over the next few weeks, industry officials said Monday.\nThe administration will formally unveil its plan when Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testifies at a House Banking Committee hearing June 3, but details of the plan are expected to emerge as early as this week, the officials said.\nUnder Secretary John Hawke, a leading architect of the administration plan, is slated to speak here on Wednesday. In his speech, Hawke may indicate the administration's stand on mixing banking and commerce, lobbyists said.\n\"Mr. Hawke certainly won't do anything to upstage Rubin,\" one lobbyist in contact with the administration noted. \"But we will hear generally where they are on some of these topics.\"\nWhile most in Congress and the finance industry agree that the Depression-era barriers separating banking from securities and insurance should be torn down, there is little consensus about going farther and allowing banks to combine with securities and other firms.\nThe administration's position has evolved over the past several months. A task force on financial reform headed by Hawke initially recommended eliminating all barriers.\nBut the specter of Citicorp or Chase Manhattan merging with General Motors Corp. or Microsoft Corp. drew strong protests from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach of Iowa, as well as prominent labor and consumer groups.\nAnd during the spring, several Democratic senators, led by Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, wrote to Rubin to register their opposition to mixing banking and commerce.\nBowing somewhat to the criticism, the administration is now said to favor allowing limited combinations. Financial firms would be limited to a \"basket\" of non-financial activity, expressed as a percentage of total revenue or capital, some lobbyists said.\nBut the basket could be further limited by prohibiting combinations of the largest financial and non-financial firms. For example, one approach would be to bar the 1,000 biggest commercial firms from owning or being owned by banks.\nAnother difficult issue concerns regulating disparate financial businesses within a diversified firm.\nAlmost everyone favors \"functional regulation,\" meaning that each activity of a firm would be regulated by the appropriate regulator. The Securities and Exchange Commission would regulate securities activities while state insurance regulators would oversee insurance sales, for example.\nBut debate continues about the level of federal intrusion in insurance regulation as well as the need for a top-level regulator to oversee entire firms.\nWhile some favor setting the Federal Reserve at the top of the heap, the administration is expected to back a committee approach. The committee would be composed of representatives of the various functional regulators.\n", "America Online Inc. was hit with two more lawsuits Wednesday when two New York law firms said they filed class actions on behalf of their clients and AOL members frustrated with the world's largest online service.\nThe two lawsuits, both filed in New York state court this week, come on the heels of a class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles on behalf of five subscribers, seeking damages for what they call fraudulent and malicious representation.\nIn addition, at least two state attorney generals have confirmed they are in discussions with America Online, seeking some resolution to complaints they have received from consumers about the continuing problem of network access.\nNew York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco and Wisconsin state Attorney General Jim Doyle are in discussions with AOL, spokesmen said.\nSince AOL switched its more than $7 million members to unlimited access for $19.95 a month, its network has been deluged by subscribers, many of whom cannot log onto the system during peak evening hours or on weekends.\nA spokeswoman for the Dulles, Va.-based company could not immediately comment on the New York lawsuits, but on Tuesday, AOL said it was upgrading its network and that it understood its users' frustration.\n\"Although we understand the frustration some members are experiencing ... the average AOL member gets more value under unlimited pricing than ever before,\" AOL said in response to the Los Angeles lawsuit.\nOne of the New York lawsuits, filed by the law firm of Goodkind Labaton Rudoff &amp; Sucharow LLP, represents four AOL members.\n\"Anyone who has tried to access AOL and its Internet service recently knows there is an interminably long wait and that the company is not providing what it has promised to its subscribers,\" attorney Edward Labaton said in a statement.\n\"It is particularly damaging to the millions of those who have been promised unlimited access on AOL for $19.95 per month and cannot benefit from the contractual obligation America Online has with them,\" he continued.\nThe lawsuit claims breach of contract, unjust enrichment, deceptive trade practices and false advertising by AOL. An AOL spokeswoman said she had not yet seen the lawsuit.\nThe other lawsuit was filed Monday by Wechsler Harwood Halebian and Feffer in New York, representing one user, Ezra Graber. This lawsuit seeks to recover damages due to breach of contract for failure to provide services.\nPeter Zinman, an attorney for Goodkind Labaton Rudoff &amp; Sucharow, said their lawsuit is separate from the one filed in Los Angeles but that all the cases could be consolidated into one class action.\n\"I would predict that there would be many suits filed all over the country,\" said Zinman.\n", "Nynex Corp. has until Monday to respond to charges it acted in bad faith by not signing an agreement with MCI Communications Corp. that would have allowed the nation's No. 2 long-distance carrier to enter Nynex's local market in New York state.\nMCI filed a motion against Nynex on Monday asking the state Public Service Commission (PSC) to impose sanctions on Nynex for failing to sign the so-called interconnection agreement, which would enable MCI to provide local phone access in the state.\nOn Wednesday, state Attorney General Dennis Vacco filed papers with the commission seeking to bar Nynex from offering long-distance service because it discriminates against local-service rivals.\nVacco has been an outspoken critic of the proposed Bell Atlantic Corp. takeover of Nynex, and its New York Telephone operating unit, on anticompetitive grounds.\nNynex operates 11.1 million local service lines while competitors have less than 100,000 local service lines, according to state regulators' estimates.\nNynex spokesman Mark Marchand said the New York-based company strongly disagreed with Vacco's assessment of their draft application for long-distance service in New York.\n\"Fifty phone companies are licensed with the PSC to provide all forms of local phone service,\" Marchand said. \"What they do is up to them. The market is open. There is no other state in the country which has a more competitive market.\"\nNynex has signed full interconnection deals with competitive access providers, including MFS Communications, a unit of WorldCom Inc.; Teleport Communications Group Inc. and WinStar Communications Inc.\nThe deals would allow the companies to route traffic over their own network switching equipment.\nIn addition, Nynex has reached resale pacts with Frontier Corp., among others, to allow companies to offer local access over Nynex's network.\nMost of the new entrants into the New York local service market are focused on profitable niches in the business services market, rather than residential service.\nThe dispute is part of a broad change across the United States due to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, under which local and long-distance providers are seeking to meet regulatory requirements that would allow them to compete on each other's historic turf.\nWashington-based MCI, which has waged an agressive campaign to enter local service markets, so far has reached five interconnection deals -- two in California, where Pacific Telesis and GTE Corp. operate, and with the respective Baby Bells in Georgia, Minnesota and Iowa.\n", "Ivory Coast has opened a new Mining Commission (COMINE) to streamline permit approval for its booming exploration sector and cut red tape for investors, a government statement said on Wednesday.\n\"COMINE will allow consideration of mining applications with speed and transparency and will guarantee coherence of points of view from different ministries,\" said the statement issued by the Ivory Coast's ministry of Mines and Energy.\nMining permit approval times would be limited to 45 days from receipt of applications while equipment import requests would be handled within 15 days, it added.\nIvory Coast set a new mining code in 1995 which came into effect last year but exploration firms have said red tape continues to dog operations.\nMines and Energy Minister Lamine Fadika told Reuters last week COMINE would begin work on Monday and handle permit approval, environmental studies and import tax matters.\nCOMINE brings together over 17 government ministries, departments and other related groups involved in decisions. In the past policy was handled by the Direction des Mines, with decisions passed up for ministerial approval.\nIn future, permit applications will be received by the government's inward investment agency, CEPICI and handed to COMINE for co-ordination of decisions, said a mining ministry official.\nPolicy management would be streamlined without changes to existing mining code rules, said mining officials.\nIvory Coast, along with other West African countries, has liberalised economic policy and attracted a lot of mining interest since the early 1990s.\nGold production stands at less than three tonnes a year from two gold mines but a third mine is due to open later this year.\nFadika said 55 permits had been issued to up to 25 companies over the past two years. Most prospectors were looking for gold -- but nickel, manganese and bauxite deposits were also promising, he said.\n\"We have already adopted a plan for a (nickel) factory to be in production by 2002,\" he added in an interview.\nCanada-based Falconbridge, is carrying out feasibility studies for mining 250 million tonnes of ore with a nickel content of about two percent, he added.\nProven bauxite deposits could also be mined.\n\"We are in discussion with several groups but we still have not chosen a consortium leader,\" said Fadika, putting reserves at one billion tonnes.\nTalks were also being held with South Africa-based Purity Metals on mining an estimated 2.7 million tonnes of ore with around 44-47 percent manganese content, he added.\nDiamond mining is also being given more attention by South African groups and studies are planned on potential coastal rutile sand deposits, a Direction des Mines research manager said.\n--Abidjan newsroom, + 225 21 90 90\n", "A British firm believes it has developed a computer programme which could prevent other financial firms getting into the sort of situation Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) is currently trying to resolve.\nNumerous risk management systems already exist, but Frasin Limited says its Windows-based SOFWIN is the first to address operational risk management rather than financial risk.\n\"We believe it will prompt senior management to ask the right questions, which will create a more disciplined and controlled environment,\" Frasin's chief executive Philip Martin told Reuters on Tuesday.\nMGAM is attempting to unscramble a complicated web of investments in three of its funds. These led to the funds being temporarily suspended last week after it revealed \"suspected irregularities\" in the them.\nA fund manager for two of the funds was suspended at the same time and had his assets frozen by a High Court injunction.\nIronically, Martin says he took the product to show Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank, some months ago with a view to selling it to them.\nHe says he will still offer it to the firm, freely admitting that his prospects may have been boosted by publicity surrounding MGAM and a recent fine for fund management firms in the Robert Fleming group over so-called \"rat-trading\" by a fund manager in a Hong Kong joint venture with Jardine Matheson.\n\"I have to thank Morgan Grenfell and Jardine Fleming because their timing has been impeccable,\" he says with a grin.\nMartin believes the software could also help banks avoid another Barings situation, where so-called \"rogue trader\" Nick Leeson, was able to run both the front and back offices, effectively monitoring his own trading.\nLeeson is currently serving a long jail sentence in Singapore for fraudulent trading which led to losses of around $1.4 billion and culminated in the blue-blooded bank's collapse.\nWhile Martin admits it will never be possible to eradicate rogue individuals, he says closer monitoring by senior management of all an institution's operations is essential.\nIf a chief executive, chief financial officer or other top official wants to avoid criticism in the event of a problem within the firm, then a programme such as that offered by Frasin, which is part of the HSBC group, should ensure they have adopted every measure possible to avoid such events.\nSOFWIN, which costs 12,000 pounds ($18,640) a year and must be signed up to for three years, takes the institution through a detailed questionnaire, with a possible 3,600 different questions.\nThe collated results, after any subsidiaries or branches have also been through the process, then gives a clear picture of where any potential weaknesses lie, Martin said. It can also compare the standards of different branches and how they each match up with an \"ideal\" set-up.\nMuch of the programme is devoted to dealing activities, as this has been found to be a major area of concern.\n\"The largest part revolves around dealing activities. I have spoken to senior managers who are scared to death about what their traders are up to,\" he added.\nBut however thorough the programme, Martin says the buck stops with senior management and they are the main target of his marketing.\n\"It takes commitment by senior management. If they are not committed to it (assessing the company's organisational risk), then it's a waste of time. But they are opening themselves up to criticism,\" he said.

We certainly don't need to be any larger.\"\nValued at between 4.0 and 7.0 billion pounds ($11.2 billion) by analysts, the merger brings together Cable and Wireless's Mercury subsidiary and the British cable television units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada's Bell Cablemedia Plc and Videotron.\nThe new company, which will serve about 1.2 million telephony and 580,000 cable TV customers, will provide a broad range of local, national and international voice and data services, and in certain regions, multichannel television and internet computer services.\nIt hopes to complete its broadband cable and local telephony networks by investing some 110 million pounds over two years and offer services to more than six million residential customers. It also wants to serve almost all small and medium-sized businesses within its 45 cable franchise areas.\nThe group will spend another 180 million pounds over the same period on so-called set top box, with which customers can receive multi channel television services.\nIt hopes to launch a formidable attack on the dominance of British Telecommunications Plc in telephony. Regulatory restrictions prevent BT from offering broadcasting services.\nThe formal offers from Cable and Wireless Communications to shareholders of the merger partners were launched on Monday as well as financial details of the company. Bell Cablemedia promptly recommended that its shareholders accept the offer.\nCable and Wireless Communications' pro forma revenues for the year to March 31, 1996, were 1.90 billion pounds with net income of 44 million pounds.\nSince the merger was announced, talk has mounted that a global telecoms alliance such as the Global One partnership of Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint Corp might take a stake in the venture.\nWith 14.7 percent of Cable and Wireless Communications (C&amp;WC) due to be floated in London and New York, the next few weeks will provide new shareholders with the opportunity to join the group -- or give old partners a chance to leave.\nNewspapers have tipped Bell Canada as being a likely candidate to sell what will be a 14.2 percent stake and end its exposure to the Britain's stagnant cable market.\nBut Wallace declined to comment on alliance speculation or Bell Canada's (BCM) long-term strategic plans, saying only: \"(BCM) is very happy with the investment that it has in C&amp;WC as far as we are aware.\"\nFrance Telecom confirmed last week that it was in talks with Cable and Wireless about the cable venture becoming the British partner of the Global One alliance.\nWallace said Cable and Wireless, which will have a 52.6 percent stake in the new company, wanted to remain a majority shareholder and would consider further investment of its own if its current partners backed out.\nBritain will be C&amp;WC's short-term focus, But Wallace said the group is also eyeing continental Europe.\nAnalysts are keenly awaiting the partial float so that the market can value the business which has assets worth 4.5 billion pounds.\nThe first closing date for the offers is April 25.

Workers have observed the call en masse and some social sectors are also joining in,\" said Hernando Hernandez, head of the oil workers' union USO, known for its combative, fiercely nationalistic stance.\n\"So far everything is passing off in a peaceful fashion. There are no reports of violence,\" he added.\nThough Hernandez said Ecopetrol had been severely affected by the strike, a senior company official told Reuters there was no effect whatsoever. Administrative employees were filling in for union workers, as part of a strike contingency plan, and production and pumping operations were proceeding normally, the official said.\nState workers called the strike to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike. The government, which is struggling to slash its burgeoning fiscal deficit, vowed to hold workers' to a weighted 13.5 percent increase. The strike began at midnight Monday (0500 GMT on Tuesday) and is to last indefinitely.\nA communique issued by National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, just hours after the strike began, underscored what authorities had already described as the threat of imminent rebel attacks.\n\"We support our union comrades. But simply making demands (through a strike) is not sufficient,\" the communique said. \"These actions must go hand in hand with effective pressure tactics and expressions of violence and grassroots disobedience as the only method to resolve the real problems of the nation.\"\nIt said its backing of the strike was a preamble to what it termed a \"national armed strike.\" In the past, the ELN has used so-called \"armed strikes\" to shut down vast regions of the country, blockading major highways, setting fire to vehicles and threatening people who show up for work.\nThe ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in the mid-1960s, specialises in economic sabotage and attacks on multinational companies.\nEven before the ELN communique was made public, tight security was clamped on the capital of Bogota, where a ban on alcohol was declared late on Monday by Mayor Antanas Mockus and a lack of public transportation prevented thousands of people from getting to work on Tuesday morning.\nState-run schools and universities across the country were shut down by the government as a security measure.\nHeavy detachments of riot police and army troops stood guard outside public offices in the downtown area, and police helicopters hovered over Plaza de Bolivar, the city's main square, where an estimated 20,000 strikers gathered to protest outside Congress on Tuesday afternoon.\nFrancisco Hernandez, a spokesman for Bogota's El Dorado international airport, said operations were \"more or less normal\" early on Tuesday. Some carriers, including Continental and American Airlines, suspended all operations in and out of Colombia since airport firemen had threatened to disrupt operations.\nA spokesman for the National Exporters Association said vast shipments of cut flowers to the United States, in preparation for this week's St. Valentine's Day holiday, had not been affected because they were flown out of Colombia on domestic carriers.\n", "Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who assumed supreme power when Deng Xiaoping died last week, on Tuesday delivered the eulogy for the patriarch before 10,000 of the nation's elite in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.\nHis voice breaking, Jiang wiped tears from his eyes. \"The people of China love Comrade Deng Xiaoping... we miss comrade Deng Xiaoping.\"\nJiang stood in front of a huge portrait of Deng, beneath which lay a casket containing his ashes, covered with a crimson hammer-and-sickle Communist Party flag.\nAs the funeral began, sirens and whistles sounded nationwide for three minutes as a mark of respect for the man who brought unprecedented prosperity to the world's most populous nation while keeping tight communist control.\n\"Grieve in silence,\" Premier Li Peng said, calling the three minutes of mourning as the thousands of Communist Party and government leaders stood to attention, heads bowed.\nOn the trading floor of the Beijing commodities exchange, traders stood silently with their heads bowed in front of an electronic screen showing live coverage of the funeral, which began at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT).\nChinese police cleared Beijing's Tiananmen Square soon after dawn, throwing a security net over the vast arena that is a potent symbol of China and a focus for expressions of grief as well as demonstrations of anger.\nChinese authorities were determined to prevent a repeat of the student-led demonstrations that convulsed Beijing in 1989 after the death of another Communist Party luminary.\nNo foreign dignitaries have been invited to the funeral but all eight Chinese television channels beamed the memorial live.\nOn Monday, television showed China's millions indelible images of their dead leader lying in state, his face pale and puffy, in the presence of solemn political leaders and grief-stricken relatives.\nIt was just the sort of lingering display of his remains that Deng -- contemptuous of the personality cult around his predecessor Mao Zedong -- had forbidden.\n\"Deng looked at peace,\" the Xinhua news agency said.\nPolitical analysts questioned however whether the patriarch would have been at ease with the way his successors have handled the delicate transition period.\nFunerary music played as China's elite and his grieving family bowed their heads before a huge portrait of Deng on the stage in the main hall.\n\"Eternal Glory to Comrade Deng Xiaoping who enjoys the love and esteem of the people of the whole party, the whole army and people of all ethnic groups throughout China,\" read a streamer hanging from one huge balcony.\nBeijing streets were virtually deserted as citizens watched the ceremony on state television.\n", "Most of Japan's second-tier brokerages said on Wednesday that they would land in the red in the current business year because of tumbling Tokyo stock prices.\nMany of the firms had previously expected to turn a profit for the 12 months to March 31 after making losses the year before, but the downward spiral in stock prices seen earlier this year has dashed their hopes of a robust bottom line.\nThe nine brokerages said the drop in the Tokyo stock market had forced them to take write offs on the shares they own in listed companies, particularly banks.\nThe stock slump, triggered by worries about the sputtering economic recovery and banking woes, also ate into commission income as investors shied away from the market.\n\"While we have profits from bond trading, we were forced, unexpectedly, to post appraisal losses on shareholdings because stock prices fell sharply from January onwards,\" an executive at Okasan Securities Co Ltd told a news conference.\nThe nine brokers which issued revised earnings forecasts on Wednesday were Okasan, Sanyo Securities Co Ltd, New Japan Securities Co Ltd, Kankaku Securities Co Ltd, Tokyo Securities Co Ltd, Cosmo Securities Co Ltd, Dai-Ichi Securities Co Ltd, Wako Securities Co Ltd and Yamatane Securities Co Ltd. The only other brokerage in the second tier, Kokusai Securities Co Ltd, did not revise its existing forecast, which is for a profit.\nPredicted parent current losses ranged from 1.5 billion yen ($12.1 million) for Sanyo and Okasan to a hefty 22 billion yen ($178 million) at Kankaku. In 1995/96, the nine firms had suffered losses ranging from 1.0 billion yen ($8.1 million) at Cosmo to 18.11 billion yen ($147 million) at Sanyo.\nThe key Nikkei average finished at 18,493.71 on Wednesday compared with 21,406.85 at the end of fiscal 1995/96.\nThe firms said daily turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the fiscal year so far had been averaging about 380 billion yen ($3.08 billion), much lower than they had expected.\nAnalysts said that to ensure profits, the second-tier brokerages need the daily turnover to be 500 billion yen ($4.06 billion) or more. Medium-sized brokerages rely more heavily on business from small investors than the top-ranking ones.\nAnalysts said that the second-tier brokers need to further streamline their business to cut costs ahead of the likely liberalisation of brokerage commissions next year in Japan's broad deregulation drive.\nRevenue has fallen sharply since the early 1990s, when Japan's asset \"bubble\" collapsed, but the brokerages have not managed to scale back costs to the same extent, they said.\n\"Some of second-tier brokerages are likely to join holding companies led by big banks in the future in line with Japan's Big Bang financial reforms,\" said Yukiko Ohara, an analyst at UBS Securites Ltd.

It will be headed in the first few years by Merck's John Preston, while Rhone's Louis Champel will become chief executive of Merial and will succeed Preston.\nMerck was No. 2 in animal health in 1995 but has been overtaken in 1996 by Novartis. Its leading product, Ivermectine, loses some of its patent protection next year but still has about eight years of sales ahead of it. Sales for this product alone in 1996 have been $750 million.\nRhone Merieux's main product is the recently launched Frontline, which has had sales this year of $85 million and are expected to double in 1997.\nMerial will benefit from the launch of a number of new Merck products in the coming years while a new jointly developed product will be ready in three years.\n\"The real creation of added value is in innovation,\" Landau said, stressing the possible synergies of the joint research and development.\nThe Merial venture is the latest of a series of big corporate moves in animal health.\nIn 1994, American Cyanamid was bought by American Home Products Corp. In 1995 Pfizer bought the animal health business of Smithkline Beecham Plc and Rhone Merieux acquired the veterinary business of Sanofi, part of Elf Aquitaine.\nIn 1996 Belgium's Solvay sold its animal health business to AHP.\nLandau said that Mallinckrodt, No. 9 in world animal health, was for sale but that Rhone was not interested.\nAsked to comment on rumours of a merger between Rhone's Rhone-Poulenc Rorerand Sanofi, following a statement Thursday by Elf that a merger was desirable for Sanofi, Landau said Rhone was not interested in a pharmaceutical alliance.\n", "Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Australian-listed stocks slumped five to ten percent on Monday as international investors fearful of a law and order meltdown reacted to the army's attempt to force the PNG government aside.\nOrogen Minerals Ltd, which is 51 percent owned by the PNG government, was one of the hardest hit, slumping seven percent or 24 cents to A$3.20. \nOther stocks jagged as much as ten percent lower in increasingly hectic afternoon trade as reports emerged that the head of the army and the police commissioner had told Prime Minister Julius Chan to resign or be forced aside in two days.\nThe army and police are angry the government has employed mercenaries to help the armed forces subdue seccessionists on Bougainville Island.\nBrokers and analysts said investors feared an army mutiny and possible civil unrest in the capital Port Moresby would spread to the remote areas where most of PNG's huge gold mines and oil projects are located.  \n\"The danger is if any local tribes use this dispute as an excuse to act up and this would affect local mining operations,\" said Shaw Stockbroking research director Michael Heffernan.\nMajor mining projects in Papua New Guinea's rugged hinterlands like the giant OK Tedi project, controlled by the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, are often in dispute with local tribal groups.\nAnalysts said investors' need look no further than the now-dormant copper project on Bougainville to see what happens when the central government and armed forces lose control.  \nThe Bougainville Copper mine was shut down in 1989 when rebellious landowners who wanted bigger returns from the project sabotaged the mine and began the current recessionist revolt.\n\"There's always a certain amount of civil unrest, but if the more militant groups in the regions use this as an excuse to party as it were, it could disrupt operations,\" Heffernan said.\nLocal brokers became increasingly pessimistic through the afternoon, moving in anticipation of an expected selloff by overseas institutional investors.  \n\"I don't know what the outcome of that (situation) is going to be but it seems to me to be very dismal,\" said broker Kevin Lourey of Melbourne-based brokerage, Peake Lands Kirwan.\n\"The international reaction to this sort of situation is usually very negative,\" said resources analyst David Walker at broker ABN AMRO Hoare Govett\n\"The fear is that tonight, particularly on the London exchange, where most of the resource investment in this part of the world comes fron, there will be a strong negative reaction,\" Walker said.  \nThe worst-affected stock in the afternoon rout was oil producer and explorer Oil Search Ltd, which fell 8.5 percent or 24 cents to A$2.60.\nBougainville Copper Ltd, which is controlled by RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd fell five cents to 55 cents.\nAnalysts said the government's moves over next day or two would be crucial in limiting any further damage. Prime Minister Chan had yet to respond to the army ultimatum by 0820 GMT.\n\"The next 24 hours is crucial for the Chan government and also for the value of these investments,\" Walker said.  \n\"It's important that the situation becomes as clear as it can very quickly in order not only for the stability of the country, but for the value of the investments.\"\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800\n", "Retailing group Coles Myer Ltd is expected to report its first profit rise in almost two years on Thursday, with improved margins helping to offset sluggish sales growth and boost first half profit by about five percent.\nAnalysts said they expected Coles Myer to report a net profit before abnormals in the 26 weeks to January 26 of about A$200 million to A$205 million, up from the A$194.5 million in the first half of 1995/96.  \nThis would be Coles' first profit rise since 1995 and follows a two-year horror run of board turmoil and controversy over corporate governance.\nAnalysts said they expected margins to have improved most at Coles' K-Mart discount department store chain in pre-Christmas trading, thanks to a refusal to discount heavily.\nThey said the strong margins evident at K-Mart's major competitor, Woolworth Ltd's Big W, were a good indicator.  \n\"Kmart was a disaster last year and given Big-W had a good result in the first half in a difficult environment, people are expecting Kmart to have improved as well,\" said Macquarie Equities analyst Simon Shakesheff said.\n\"It's just a question of how much,\" he said. Shakesheff is forecasting a A$200 million net profit for the half year and a A$319 million profit for the full year.\nKmart produced earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of A$50.6 million in the first half of 1995/96, down from A$93.2 million the previous comparable half.  \nSavage pre and post-Christmas discounting in 1995 cut the EBIT margin during the half to 2.9 percent from 5.5 percent.\nAnalysts said they also expected a slight margin improvement to boost performance at Coles' Myer-Grace department store chain, although not to the same extent as KMart.\n\"They look like they (the Coles group) are recovering,\" said one retail analyst, who was forecasting a A$205 million net profit for the half and A$302 million for the full year.\n\"Their Christmas trading has been better and they've done better in department stores than some of the others like David Jones,\" the analyst said.  \nColes' supermarket division was also seen improving as sales have held up in the food sector at the expense of the wider apparel and merchandise sectors.\nThe Coles group has already posted its sales result for the six months to January 26, showing overall sales growth of 5.4 percent to A$9.945 billion. This compared with 8.6 percent sales growth in the first half of 1995/96.\nAnalysts also said profits from property sales in the first half would help boost the pre-abnormal profit as Coles puts property sales profits above the line.  \nColes said in December it would settle about A$705 million of property sales in the first half of 1996/97, having sold around A$830 million worth of property since July 1996.\nAnalysts expect Coles' slight improvement from its low base to continue in the second half year, with forecasts for the full year ranging from A$285 million to A$350 million and averaging A$309.7 million.\nThis compares with the A$302 million net profit before abnormals posted in 1995/96, which was itself down 28 percent on 1994/95.  \nBrierley Investments Ltd, through its Australian unit Consolidated Investments Ltd, owns 7.4 percent of Coles Myer.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n", "The saga of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and its rich Indonesian gold discovery took another twist on Friday as doubts about the Busang deposit and the mysterious death of its chief geologist pushed investors to dump the stock.\nShares in the Calgary, Alberta-based prospector were initially halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange after an Indonesian newspaper said a review by Busang partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. ) showed the deposit was smaller than Bre-X's estimate of 71 million ounces.\nNew Orleans-based Freeport said on Friday its due diligence of the site was not finished. But that failed to appease skittish investors when the stock resumed trading.\nBre-X shares sank to a 52-week low of C$14.25 in frenzied afternoon trading. It closed down C$2.25 at C$15.20 on 9 million shares, the most active trader in Toronto.\nOn Nasdaq, Bre-X fell $1.625 to $11 on 1.6 million shares after earlier hitting a low of $10.25.\nFreeport shares fell $1 to $30.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"I've concluded the only person who could ever make a movie out of this is Alfred Hitchcock. It's become so bizarre that people have lost any tolerance for staying in,\" Goepel Shields analyst Rick Cohen said in a telephone interview.\nAdding to the uncertainty was the death of Bre-X chief geologist Michael de Guzman, a co-discoverer of the Busang gold deposit.\nDe Guzman, who fell out of a helicopter on Wednesday while flying to the gold site in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province, was ill and may have committed suicide, Indonesian officials said. De Guzman's body has not been found.\n\"Obviously, one of the reasons the stock has been under a lot of pressure is because of this mystery of the man's death. He was their chief on-site exploration guy...which cast some doubt on the stock,\" said PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen.\nAnalysts predicted rumors would swirl around Busang until Freeport issued a statement after completing its review.\nCiting unnamed sources, Indonesia's Harian Ekonomi Neraca newspaper reported on Friday that Freeport's test results did not match Bre-X's estimates.\n\"It is possible that the deposit is not as big as it has been mentioned before. It could be that it is not viable to mine this deposit,\" the newspaper said, quoting the source.\nBut a Freeport official said on Friday the company would not comment until its review was finished.\nThis week's intrigue added to an already suspenseful tale surrounding the fabulous gold deposit deep in the rain forest of Indonesia's Borneo island.\nSeveral months ago, the Busang deposit was the subject of a bidding war in which several mining companies wooed the Indonesian government for control of what has been called the biggest gold find of the century.\nToronto-based Barrick Gold Corp., armed with a high-powered advisory board led by former U.S. President George Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, initially dominated the negotiations for control of Busang.\nBut Barrick's inside track ended when the government of President Suharto brought in Indonesian businessman Muhammad \"Bob\" Hasan in January.\nHasan brokered a deal that gave Freeport, a veteran mining player in Indonesia, 15 percent of Busang and the right to mine the project.\nThe arrangement left Bre-X with 45 percent, down from an original 90 percent, and the rest to the Indonesian government and two Indonesian companies.\n", "The British supermarket group ASDA racked up a gain in first half results and sales on Thursday and analysts said there were signs of more to come.\n\"We thought this recovery story would come to an end sooner but there is still more upside, it seems,\" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.\nASDA, known for innovation and cheeky marketing initiatives, said pretax profits before exceptionals were 160.1 million pounds ($267 million), up from 138.3 million pounds ($230 million) a year ago, and paid out a dividend of 0.81 pence per share, up from 0.72 pence.\nSales from existing stores in the first half were 10.2 percent up on a year ago and ASDA edged up its market share by 0.5 points to 10.6 percent.\n\"Keeping it simple has been the key to our success. These results show we are on course to deliver...our (strategy) programme for 1998,\" chairman Archie Norman said in a statement.\nASDA's shares touched a high of 125 pence before edging back to be down 1/2 pence at 123.1/4 pence by 1103 GMT.\nASDA's sales gain is the highest in the industry for the period and comes on top of a strong rise a year ago.\n\"That is an extraordinary performance, double digit on double digit,\" said the analyst.\n\"One thing the market seems to have underestimated is how low the point was that ASDA recovered from,\" he added.\nASDA implemented a three-year \"Renewal\" strategy in the early 1990s aimed at turning the group round from huge debts and slow sales, which was followed this year by the start of a three-year \"Breakout\" strategy.\n\"I think the market thought Renewal was the recovery and it was over but that is not the case at all, they are carrying on the gains into Breakout,\" the analyst said.\nASDA said its aim to be the lowest on price had been achieved \"with only a modest investment in our gross margn,\" as it moved to cut operating and distribution costs.\nLeighton, who took over as chief executive from the entrepeneurial Norman in August, said second half margins were likely to be similar to those in the first six months, \"down a bit, a smidgeon.\"\nHe said much of the impact in the first half had come from petrol, where a fierce price war has raged between supermarkets and oil companies, but pressures now seem to be easing.\nASDA is also trying to push its total sales to include more own-brand products where margins are generally higher.\nIt said own-brand goods now accounted for 35 percent of total sales, adding it was \"well on our way to achieving our...objective of 40 percent ASDA brand penetration by 1998.\"\nThe company aims to open seven stores in the second half, which will all be large, \"market hall\" style, Leighton said, with similar opening levels on the cards for a couple of years..\nLeighton said the company wanted the \"critical mass\" to drive growth markets of fresh food, entertainment, clothing and healthcare.\nBut he said the group was \"under no pressure\" to launch a loyalty card throughout the country, even though the other three major supermarkets -- J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway -- have all started schemes nationwide.\nASDA is testing a card in several stores but Leighton said ASDA customers tended to focus on price, quality and service.

Ltd.'s rival video game machine. Sony's move could force Nintendo to cut its prices, which would accelerate hardware and accelerate software purchases, analysts said.\n\"Hardware price cuts are good news for everybody,\" said Mike Wallace, analyst at UBS Securities in New York. \"The most important thing to the industry is a bigger installed base\" of video game machines.\nSony's price cut could be the start of a boom for the video game industry, similar to the one in the late 1980s.\nFor the past three years, game companies have had lukewarm sales because of high prices for the new generation of video game machines, based on so-called 32-bit or 64-bit technologies. While the next-generation offerings from Sony, Nintendo and Sega Enterprises have much better graphics and sound than their predecessors, they have been too expensive for most households, analysts said.\nWith the price cut, the number of PlayStation units in use in the United States could almost double to 6 million by Christmas, from about 3.4 million right now, Wallace said.\nSony officials said even with the price cuts they make money on each PlayStation. They also said they do not expect their software price cuts to hurt outside software publishers, since Sony's software prices are slightly higher than the rest of the industry's.\nSoftware executives applauded Sony's move.\n\"This is obviously great for the software publishers,\" said Bobby Kotick, chairman of video game software company Activision Inc.. Kotick said with hardware prices getting closer to $100, he expects 18 million to 20 million machines to be sold by year-end.\nNintendo officials said they are analysing Sony's move. Nintendo is sold out of the Nintendo 64 machine and has a month's backlog of orders at $199 apiece, so it does not have a reason to cut its prices for now, said George Harrison, Nintendo vice president of marketing in Redmond, Wash.\nSega officials could not immediately be reached for comment.\n", "Ordinarily seated at the rear of a courtroom, behind deep ranks of dark-suited corporate lawyers fighting anti-cigarette lawsuits, is the mystified legal defender of Dosal Tobacco Co.\n\"What am I doing here?\" Jose Martinez often asks as he fidgets through yet another courtroom hearing in one of the high-profile tobacco cases heading for trial.\nMartinez, of the Miami law firm Martinez, Gutierrez &amp; DeCordoba, puts that question to judges and to plaintiff attorneys pressing lawsuits on behalf of sick smokers, non-smokers claiming injuries from other people's cigarette fumes and the State of Florida, which is seeking tobacco money for Medicaid costs.\n\"We're just a small manufacturer, a family operation. We shouldn't be here,\" Martinez insists to anyone who will listen.\nDosal -- now swept up in one of the great legal battles of the century -- is a tiny family-owned company based in Opa-Locka, a poor city north of Miami built by a real estate developer with a fanciful taste for Moorish architecture.\nIt makes but a few million cigarettes a year -- compared with Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the largest cigarette maker in the world, which last year shipped nearly 231 billion cigarettes in the United States alone.\nStill, Dosal's name appears in three anti-tobacco lawsuits in Florida and another in Michigan, along with deep-pocketed giants such as RJR Nabisco Holdings and Philip Morris, which last year had more than $35 billion in tobacco sales.\nDosal's main customer is the Florida prison system, which sells Dosal's DTC brand cigarettes in regular and king-sized lengths to the smokers among the state's 50,000 inmates.\nEven so, Dosal is named in the state's lawsuit against tobacco companies.\nDosal also makes a brand or two favoured by elderly Cuban emigres in south Florida, including Competidora.\n\"They buy bulk tobacco and make cigarettes on machines in Opa-Locka. It's a very small operation,\" Martinez said. \"And the customers for the Cuban brands are old and dying.\"\nGood-humoured and joking much of the time, Martinez is deadly serious about eliminating the legal threat to Dosal.\nIn addition to filing formal requests that Dosal be dropped, he presses plaintiff lawyers informally with arguments on the futility of suing a company with limited financial resources.\n\"I ask every day,\" Martinez says.\nIf kept in the lawsuits, including the so-called Broin class-action suit scheduled to go to trial Monday in Miami, Dosal could be made to pay a share of any monetrary judgment. The lawyers pressing the Broin case intend to ask for $5 billion or more in damages.\nAnd while the tobacco industry has yet to pay out a dollar in court damages after four decades of litigation, leaks in the industry's defences are widely seen on Wall Street and elsewhere.\nThe Broin case, being brought on behalf of an estimated 60,000 ailing and non-smoking flight attendants by lawyers Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt, is the first of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits coming to trial this year against U.S. cigarette makers.\n\"It's their fault,\" Martinez said, pointing to the Rosenblatts during a courtroom interview this week after a hearing in the Broin case, filed more than six years ago.\n\"All the other suits copied theirs.\"\nMartinez said the Rosenblatts, who have named 10 defendants in the Broin lawsuit, were also responsible for the Michigan anti-tobacco lawsuit which has targeted Dosal and other cigarette makers.\n\"I don't think we have even sold any cigarettes in Michigan,\" Martinez said.\n", "London-based international bank HSBC Holdings Plc Monday posted a 23 percent rise in 1996 profits, but Chief Executive John Bond predicted a challenging year ahead with increasing competition.\nDespite the prospect of tougher conditions, Bond said the banking group, which is one of the biggest in the world, had a strong capital position and a balance sheet that made it ready to meet competition head-on.\n\"We see 1997 as a challenging year wherever we look, whether it be Asia or the UK, the competition continues to increase,\" Bond said in an interview.\nEarlier, HSBC announced a 23 percent rise in pretax profits for 1996 to 4.52 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) -- around the middle of market expectations.\nBond said HSBC's British unit Midland Bank would continue to grow organically as the price of acquisitions was impossible to justify to shareholders.\nMidland put in a strong performance with pretax profits up more than 20 percent and costs held to a rise of less than 1 percent.\nBond said HSBC's capital ratios were strong, though he did not see surplus capital being generated.\n\"As long as we're making a respectable return on capital, we regard capital strength as an asset in our business,\" Bond said. \"It helps you with the ratings, it helps with deposits in Asia and to have a strong capital position shows in the bottom line.\"\nHSBC had a 21.3 percent return on capital in 1996 compared with 20.7 percent in 1995.\nBond said HSBC continued to be confident about Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese rule in July.\nLast year, HSBC was granted a licence to trade in the Chinese yuan and Bond said the bank was talking to the Chinese authorities to see how this would work in practice.\nBond said HSBC was looking at this massive potential business opportunity in the long term.\n\"I think it will take time, of course it will, but the signs are all positive.\"\nHe said the rise of sterling against the dollar had not had a great effect on the group's results in 1996, with the average rate for the pound against the dollar below that of 1995. But he said that, very roughly, for every cent the pound goes up against the dollar, the bank loses 13 million pounds in profit ($21 million).\n", "MCI Communications Corp on Wednesday said it developed a new network type called Vault which combines conventional voice telephone networks with packet-switched networks like the Internet on a single line.\nMCI said the cost is part of the $100 million a year it is spending on upgrading its Internet networks. The company plans to earn $2 billion a year in Internet revenues by the end of the century.\n\"It can be done over a conventional phone line,\" MCI Chief Engineering Officer Fred Briggs told Reuters.\nFor example the technology will allow a customer to talk to and receive computer data from an MCI service representative simultaneously on a single, conventional telephone line by turning the voice into data packets.\n\"We have been working on this for months,\" Briggs said. He declined to say whether MCI had patented the technology.\nCustomers currently need separate lines to communicate over a telephone network and a packet-switched network.\nPacket switching means that traffic is divided into manageable chunks and labelled for its ultimate destination. It will be sent via the most convenient route, while conventional phone calls can only travel the route set in advance.\nPacket switching has a network efficiency benefit. It is the difference between diverting cars away from city congestion and not being able to do the same to bypass a breakdown on the subway.\n\"From a customer's perspective, communications will be simplified.  The issue of which network a communication travels over will be irrelevant,\" said MCI President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Price.\nMCI is already using Vault technology to provide enhanced features to its directlineMCI product by allowing customers to update their account profiles via the World Wide Web.\nMCI plans to add products suitable for vault in areas like intranet managed services, facsimile, document sharing, video conferencing and communications management.

A van and a chassis cab, or pick-up truck, would follow, also produced at Jiangling's plant in Nanchang, eastern Jiangxi province, she said.\nJiangling's share of China's top-end light truck market had fallen in recent years to 15-18 percent from about 20 percent as that of its major competitor, Qingling Motors, had risen to about 21 percent, Salomon's Lu said.\nHe said Qingling's use of Japanese technology through its cooperative deal with Isuzu put it one car generation, or about 10 years, ahead of Jiangling.\nQingling vehicles also commanded a premium of about 10 percent because of their use of the Isuzu name and technology.\nQingling had sold about 35,000 vehicles in 1996, Lu said. Jiangling said in December it expected 1996 sales to reach 17,000 vehicles, compared to 20,500 in 1995.\nAn injection of Ford capital and technology for Jiangling would be a welcome step towards the future, said analyst John Lu at ING-Barings in Shanghai.\nContinued economic growth would spur infrastructure development, he said, and growth of China's interior would spur demand for light trucks for passenger and goods transport.\nAn analyst with a western bank in Shenzhen, where Jiangling is listed, said the deal would help lower Jiangling's production costs, a substantial overhead in car manufacturing.\nSome analyst sources said, however, it could be up to three years before Jiangling was able to effectively utilise the unfamiliar Ford capital and technology.\n\"I don't know how they will merge their two technologies,\" Salomon's Lu said. \"Or will they choose the new Ford technology and replace the old with the new -- which would mean they have much higher start-up costs.\"\n\"Jiangling will still need at least a couple of years to get production up and running using new technology that is unfamiliar to them, and in redeveloping their market,\" Lu said.\nThe Shenzhen-based banker said the announcement of the deal should not have any effect on Jiangling's share price,\n\"There will be some dilution, but the effect would be countered by better company prospects,\" she said.\nTrading in Jiangling shares was suspended on Wednesday morning on the announcement.

But advocates and even opponents expect the president's policy ultimately to survive.\nGingrich, in a toughly worded statement, said he supported MFN status for China, but blasted Clinton for not using his announcement to press China for advances on human rights, democratic freedoms and religious tolerance.\nEven if lawmakers muster enough votes to reject the president's decision -- which is considered unlikely -- opponents doubt they could round up the two-thirds vote needed to override an expected veto from Clinton.\nCongress later this summer will vote on whether to overturn Clinton's decision, with the House voting first.\n\"The opponents have a better chance than they have had in the past several years. But it still may not be enough of a margin to withstand a veto,\" said Thea Lee, international expert at the AFL-CIO, which opposes MFN status for China.\nBut even a defeat for MFN's opponents could amount to a sort of victory if the vote is close enough.\nGary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, said: \"The president's action represents the high-water mark of the pro-MFN forces. As the truth of the human rights violations in China reaches the American public the case for MFN collapses.\"\nA sign Clinton will face tougher sledding emerged a week ago, when an influential House Republican leader urged the president to revoke China's MFN status, citing Beijing's record on human rights, weapon sales and trade.\nRep. Bill Paxon of New York, a Gingrich ally who chairs meetings of Republican House leaders, said current U.S. policy had yielded only \"a Chinese regime which thumbs its nose at the United States and places its heel on the neck of freedom.\"\nBut not all Republicans oppose MFN status for China, including Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, who has introduced a bill in Congress to make China's MFN status permanent.\n\"I believe we should move toward ending the annual MFN roller coaster ride altogether,\" Chafee said on Monday.\nSome Democratic lawmakers are also critical of China.\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said the situation had worsened considerably since Clinton \"delinked\" trade from human rights three years ago, citing worsening human rights conditions, a widening U.S. trade gap with China, and China's continued weapon sales to countries like Iran.\nBut supporters of the administration's policy remain confident. \"In the end, the votes will be there for MFN,\" said Calman Cohen of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, representing the heads of big U.S. corporations.\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation welcomed Clinton's decision and said it would allow the farm industry to expand its favorable trade balance with China.\n", "The boards of RightChoice Managed Care Inc and parent Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri are moving to calm relations with regulators, return to profitability and ensure company control is firmly in the hands of chief executive John O'Rourke.\nThe three-pronged strategy was highlighted Tuesday when the boards said talks about a possible combination of RightChoice and BJC Health Systems had been halted, putting an end to a project conceived and launched last year by two top executives who were fired on Wednesday.  \nIn an interview with Reuters, O'Rourke said the talks with BJC -- a St. Louis hospital organization -- were called off primarily for business reasons.\n\"It was clear as we proceeded in the discussion with BJC that the kind of deal that was being considered...would not be acceptable to the national Blue Cross association,\" he said.\nBut he added that the boards of RightChoice and the Missouri Blues meant to show their support for him as well.\n\"The other part of the decision was...a vote of confidence in the company and in the management team that had just been hired to direct the company,\" he said.  \nRightChoice expects to return to profitability later this year.\n\"We're really projecting, at least at this point in time, that we will return to profitability by the third or fourth quarter,\" he said.\nThe St. Louis-based company lost $3.7 million on revenues of $170.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $4.9 million on revenues of $154.6 million a year earlier. Wall Street registered its disapproval of the announcement of the halted BJC talks by driving shares in RightChoice down 3-1/2 to close Tuesday at 13-3/8.  \nOn the day of the management shake-up, O'Rourke was in the office of Missouri Department of Insurance director Jay Angoff with an offer to make peace, he said.\nIn May 1996, the Missouri Blues sued Angoff seeking a declaratory judgment that all applicable laws had been followed in the 1994 restructuring creating RightChoice.\nThe Blues also sought a permanent injunction barring the department from taking certain actions against the company.\nIn August, the department blocked a proposed share transaction in which RightChoice would have purchased 1.5 to 2.0 million of its own shares from the Blues.  \nThen on December 31, a Missouri judge ruled the Blues had \"abused or exceeded their legal authority\" in undertaking the reorganization that created RightChoice three years earlier.\nHeimburger vowed to fight the court ruling. Meanwhile, under his watch, RightChoice lost money in its third and fourth fiscal quarters.\nIn February, O'Rourke was named chairman and chief executive of RightChoice, replacing Heimburger. O'Rourke had previously been president and chief executive of HealthLink Inc, which RightChoice acquired in 1995.\n\"I have a mandate from the board to...improve the profitability of the company, to improve the public image and to address our regulatory issues,\" O'Rourke said.\nThe Missouri Blues' appeal of the December 31 court ruling is still pending and the share transaction proposal remains on hold, O'Rourke said.\n((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787))\n", "Global One, a telecommunications venture owned by Sprint Corp., Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom, lost more money than expected in 1996 and is poised to cut jobs, two sources close to the company said Wednesday.\nThe venture set up in January last year was expected to lose $250 million for 1996 but has in fact lost almost $370 million, one source close to the venture told Reuters.\n\"The partners are furious about the losses. Word has come down that they are looking to cut jobs,\" said the source, who asked not to be identified.\nNeither Global One nor Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint, which owns a 33 percent stake in the group, would comment.\nIt was not immediately possible to contact Deutsche Telekom or France Telecom which share the remaining 67 percent. However, a second source, close to one of the partners later confirmed the accuracy of the story.\nCurrent analyst expectations are of losses of up to $250 million, of which around $85 million would be attributable to Sprint and $51 million of that has already been recorded in the first nine months.\nSprint is planning to report fourth quarter results on Feb. 4 and First Call's analyst consensus of fourth quarter earnings has already slipped in recent days to 69 cents per share from 70 cents, compared to a year ago 79 cents, when Sprint posted a net profit of $278 million, excluding one-time charges.\nAnalysts say much depends on the proportion of the loss attributable to Sprint, the tax effects, and how the partners account for it, but it will clearly hit earnings per share.\n\"If this is true, Global One's effect on Sprint will jump up from per share losses of 2-4 cents per quarter in the first nine months to in excess of 10 cents in the fourth quarter,\" said Bill Deatherage of Bear Stearns.\nGlobal One currently has 2,900 employees and has been spending heavily to build a network powerful enough for it to carry traffic for other telecom firms as well as to cater to the global needs of large businesses.\nThe partners have revealed no financial details about Global One's performance in 1996 except to say it is expected to end the year with more than $800 million of orders.\n", "Copper and zinc were the main focus of attention for Far East metal traders on Monday, though China's exit from the market to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Ox left a gaping hole in trading activity.\nChina has closed down to celebrate the arrival of the new lunar year.

It even has a driver's side door compartment big enough to safely hold your pistol.\nExtra doors. Larger trunks. Cupholders that warm up and cool down. It's a practical world out there, and automakers have gotten the message.\nA walk around the show, which opens to the public on Saturday, turns up cars, sport/utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans with a raft of new features designed to make your vehicle as handy as can be.\nThe new Chevrolet Corvette has undergone structural changes that make it easier to climb into the low-slung sports car. Designers have added more than 12 cubic feet of cargo room -- enough to fit two sets of golf clubs into the trunk.\nVolkswagen is testing the waters with a new two-door concept car called the Coupe CJ. Designed specifically for the American market, the car can seat four people comfortably. The trunk has nearly 15 cubic feet.\nChrysler Corp. is showing the Dakar, a concept version of its popular Jeep Wrangler that has four doors. It is just one of several new types of sport/utilities that automakers are displaying as they seek to carve up the fast-growing market into even smaller niches.\nOne of the more extreme sport/utility concepts is the Open View from Wilhelm Karmann GmbH, an auto industry supplier from Osnabrueck, Germany. Built off a Ford Explorer platform, the Open View has a retractable roof system that essentially turns the vehicle into a convertible sport/utility.\nPerhaps the best example of burgeoning practicality is Ford's Mercury MC4 concept. Designed as a coupe, the car has two half doors that open to the rear.

Giddings also said it retained Credit Suisse First Boston to explore all strategic alternatives.\nMany analysts think that Harnischfeger's bid will prove to be successful.\nWhile saying the Harnischfeger bid was not a done deal, \"We expect (Harnischfeger) to pursue its target with vigour and would be surprised if another offer significantly higher than the one now on the table would surface,\" J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosowrth Inc., said.\nHarnischfeger said it is looking at using Giddings &amp; Lewis to expand in the fragmented industrial products aftermarket service business, which Harnischfeger estimates as an $80 billion market.\nBut some analysts said buying Giddings &amp; Lewis, a company that took a $64.1 million charge last year to try to fix its integrated automation systems business, adds a lot of uncertainty for Harnischfeger shareholders.\n\"...We believe that investors will be looking at a fundamentally different company with much more risk involved than they had previously,\" Brumley wrote in a research note, in which he also lowered the rating of Harnischfeger to a hold from a buy.\nBut some analysts said Harnischfeger has picked a perfect time to go after Giddings &amp; Lewis. Giddings &amp; Lewis has already taken steps to fix its underperforming operations, but the stock, in their opinion, still is ailing, they said.\n\"They got all the dirty work behind them,\" said Darren Bagwell, analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co Inc. \"They've wiped the slate clean, and yet the stock price still reflects that wait and see attitude.\"\nIn fact, Bagwell also said Giddings &amp; Lewis could probably squeeze a higher bid out of somebody and said he felt the company was worth more than $19 a share.\nHarnischfeger Industries stock fell $3.125 to $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "The French government on Wednesday called off the controversial sale of electronics group Thomson SA in a major policy U-turn after weeks of staunchly defending its choice of buyer.\nIt was the second privatisation to be halted in less than a month, after a decision to suspend the sale of state-owned bank CIC.\nIt comes at a time when Prime Minister Alain Juppe, at a record low in opinion polls, is anxious to avoid another labour revolt following last month's truckers stoppage.\nThe Finance Ministry said in a statement the suspension of the proposed Thomson sell-off to Lagardere Groupe was due to objections to the planned sale of the company's consumer electronics unit to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.\nSeveral thousand workers of Thomson Multimedia marched in Paris and other cities on November 20 to protest against a sale to a booming Asian competitor, fearing for their jobs and working conditions.\nStaff were also enraged by Juppe telling parliament in October their hi-tech company was worthless. The prime minister said the company was \"worth not even a franc, it is worth 14 billion francs of debt.\"\nSocialist opposition leaders attacked the government for opting to sell Thomson to Lagardere and not to rival bidder Alcatel Alsthom without awaiting the binding opinion of the independent Privatisation Commission.\nIt was that body which told the government on Monday it could not agree with the sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo.\nThe Finance Ministry said it still believed the sale of Thomson was vital because of President Jacques Chirac's wish to create a world-class electronics group, maintain employment and keep key technologies.\nThe government said in October it had picked Lagardere because it was best for French defence interests and would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc (19 cents) after a 10.8 billion franc state capital injection.\nLagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58-percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its own Matra Defense Espace.\nThe Finance Ministry's surprise announcment came on the day the European Commission had been expected to give the green light to the deal.\nThe ministry said the Privatisation Commission \"declared itself incapable of giving a favourable opinion to the Lagardere Groupe offer, because of the terms of Daewoo Electronics' purchase of Thomson Multimedia.\"\n\"Consequently, the government has decided to suspend the privatisation process under way,\" it said.\nIt added the companies could continue their discussions with the Privatisation Commission and the state would pursue talks with the European Commission about conditions for a capital increase, on which Brussels had expressed reservations.\nShares in Lagardere and Thomson-CSF were suspended, while those of Alcatel fell three percent with investors expecting the group to make a new bid that could create uncertainties about the financing and its own profit recovery.\nLagardere said in a statement it was still interested in taking over Thomson, which it called of strategic importance. A spokesman for Alcatel Alsthom said only the company \"took note\" of the decision.\n\"The chances (for Alcatel) have got to be increased by this, if they can come up with a different offer,\" said a Paris share broker, adding the decision was a blow to the government's standing. \"It doesn't look good for the French government.\"\nAlcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk recently said he was ready to make a new offer for Thomson, breaking weeks of silence after French newspapers suggested Chirac might have been influenced by a disputed report of British plans to take over the company.\nBritain's GEC has said it is willing to talk about a cooperation deal with whoever wins Thomson.

It now controls about 70 companies with combined equity of about 20 billion crowns.\nAnalysts agreed it was potentially an interesting stock, but much more transparency was needed.\nAnna Bossong, analyst at ING Barings, said Chemapol would have trouble with a planned 600 million crown issue of global depository receipts (GDR) expected later this year if the company is not more forthcoming.\n\"I think it would be very difficult. One of the problems this company has is a difficulty with transparency. Increased transparency would be the first thing foreign investors look to before they would invest into GDRs,\" Bossong told Reuters.\nChemapol originally planned the issue for the last year, but then delayed it, saying domestic investors had already sufficient demand for the nominal 826 million crowns in new shares issued last autumn.\nMost of the new issue was gobbled up by existing shareholders which includes six major local banks -- Komercni Banka, Ceska sporitelna, IPB, Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, Agrobanka and Union Banka -- and management.\nOnly a handful of shares have traded on the PSE since it was listed last week.\nChemapol's empire grew from an oil trading company -- a business it partially lost to local refineries -- to include major chemical companies, a small airline, a publishing house, an arms trading firm and sports franchises and clubs.\nIt is also competing in a tender for a more than one-third stake in the largest Czech defence firm, the debt-strapped jet maker Aero Vodochody a.s.\nChemapol's spokesman Vadim Petrov said the conglomerate is aiming to improve the information flow. \"That is a process we are working on intensively,\" he said.\nIt has yet to reveal 1996 results. Petrov said they would be released when an audit is finished, probably in April.\nOn January 1, the firm adopted a new structure creating sub-holdings grouping its distribution, trading, chemical, communications and real estate holdings.\n\"The new structure is quite good... the sub-holding arrangement is logical and the acquisitions, especially in the chemical industry, logically chain on,\" said Atlantik's Zak.\nBut Ondrej Vojtech of Akro Capital warned: \"The acquisition policy is known to be too broad-minded, and I have the feeling that they are trying to get money from everywhere.\"\nPetrov said this year Chemapol would try to stabilise and consolidate its holdings, and is not planning any large acquisitions, apart from the potential Aero stake.\nThe group posted audited net profit of 62.5 million crowns in 1995.

On the other side, Rep. Richard Baker, chairman of the subcommittee, has offered a bill that would impose virtually no limits on such combinations.  \nA possible middle approach, contained in a bill introduced by Rep. Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, and Rep Bruce Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, would allow financial companies to conduct up to 25 percent of their business in non-financial activities.\nBaker, republican from Louisiana, continued to back his approach at the hearing.\n\"With limited regulatory oversight and greater vigor, financial institutions can pursue consumer demand and can broaden activities,\" he said. \"That should include commerce.\"  \nLeach did offer some new nuances to his previous statements on the issue. He provided the subcommittee with charts prepared by the Federal Reserve outlining the hypothetical mergers permitted under various approaches.\nFor example, a 25 percent limit on non-financial activity based on total asset size would allow a large bank like Chase Manhattan to acquire all but six of the largest companies in the entire country. If Chase merged with a large securities firm like Salomon Brothers, the Fed data indicated it could acquire even Exxon Corp, fourth largest company in the country based on market value.  \nA 10 percent limit would leave 18 companies out of Chase's sights or eight from a merged Chase-Salomon.\nBased on the Fed's findings, Leach suggested that, if Congress does include a percentage-based limitation, the limit should be a portion of total capital.\n\"If it seems that modest investment experimentation should be granted banks, a basket that relates to capital rather than business activity might, at least initially, be more prudential and less market distorting,\" he said.\nLooking at book equity values as a measure of capital, the Fed found Chase would be barred from acquiring the 74 largest companies in the United States under a 25 percent cap. Under a 10 percent cap, 215 large companies would be off-limits.

That, in turn, would make the Havas media group the biggest shareholder in Canal Plus.\nThe companies added in a joint statement that they would not comment further pending board meetings scheduled for February 6.\nThe prospect of a major transformation of the French media landscape gained weight when a corporate source confirmed that Alcatel Alsthom was in talks about a possible sale of part of its 21.2 percent stake in Havas to Generale des Eaux.\nGenerale des Eaux, already a powerful force in the water and telecommmunications industry, owns almost 20 percent of Canal Plus. The satellite broadcaster is itself merging with fellow-pay-TV group Nethold to create Europe's largest subscription television company.\nAccording to French newspapers, Generale des Eaux would transfer its Canal Plus stake into Havas, almost doubling Havas's current 21.6 percent stake in the broadcaster. Havas would then increase its own capital to allow Generale des Eaux a bigger stake.\nOther major shareholders in Canal Plus are the bank Societe Generale, with 4.5 percent, and the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations with 6.9 percent.\nGenerale des Eaux would also become indirectly the biggest shareholder in the merged Canal Plus company. Havas would establish its direct dominance within Canal Plus, well ahead of Nethold's owners, Richemont and MIH, which have 15 and 4.9 percent repectively.\nAlcatel has owned 21.2 percent of Havas since selling its media business to Havas in 1995 in return for shares in Havas, which it was obliged to hold on to for at least two years.\nThe initial market reaction was broadly positive. Havas shares soared and those of Generale jumped too. \"It's a good deal for all parties involved,\" one share dealer said.\nAlcatel stands to make a capital gain on the sale, as well as receiving cash, because the Havas share price has increased a lot over the past year, in line with a French stock market which is at record highs.\nAlcatel needs money to finance its planned acquisition, if the state permits it, of the government's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF.\nThe government is due to announce its Thomson-CSF sale plans shortly, after scrapping its original privatisation plan in December.\nNewspapers have for months speculated about the Havas share structure, although Generale des Eaux has in the past denied plans to raise its stake.\nOn the share market, Havas shares opened up eight percent but then gave in some of the gains to trade 5.3 percent up at 427 francs.\nGenerale des Eaux was 0.7 percent up at 713, but Canal Plus was 0.93 percent lower at 1,171 and Alcatel slipped 0.55 percent to 545 francs.\n", "Three time-bombs planted on buses blew up in rapid succession in China's restive far west, killing at least four people and shattering the nation's calm in the delicate aftermath of the death of patriarch Deng Xiaoping.\nPolice patrolled streets and checked suspicious bags and packages on Wednesday in Urumqi, capital of the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang, following the blasts in the city on Tuesday afternoon.\n\"I think at least four to five people were killed, including one child who died instantly,\" said a Xinjiang television station official, who declined to be identified.\n\"People are full of fear, and the city is on high alert,\" said the TV station official.\nThe blasts, which officials said injured at least 60, occurred within minutes in separate parts of the city, which is the centre of Chinese control over the region and its ethnic Uighur population.\nThe explosions occurred on the same day as the final rites were being observed in far-off Beijing for Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who strictly enforced the integrity of China against separatist threats.\nIn an ironic twist, one bomb went off on Tuanjie (Unity) Street. A fourth was found before it detonated, a local government official said without elaborating.\nDespite the widespread fear of further unrest, state media in Urumqi and elsewhere in the county have not reported the incidents.\n\"Everybody knows about it but nothing has been said officialy,\" said a local resident contacted by telephone.\nIt was the first known violence in Xinjiang, a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan, since anti-Chinese riots in Yining on February 5 and 6 left nine people dead.\nNo one has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blasts. Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by attacks on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\nChinese leaders have expressed concern over the threat from Islamic fundamentalism, visiting Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said in Beijing.\n\"I think we have a very similar view on this,\" he said.\n\"Every attempt to turn religion into a weapon becomes extremely dangerous, it is something that knows no boundaries,\" Levy said. \"It is like sand, it can be transported by the wind from one place to another.\"\nTuesday's bombs exploded at around 6.40 p.m. (1040 GMT). \"People in Urumqi usually finish work at seven, so not too many people were injured or killed,\" the TV official said.\nUrumqi residents recounted Tuesday's few minutes of terror.\n\"The Number 44 bus exploded near the Agricultural Bank,\" said a young Uighur woman. \"A trishaw driver was killed, he was lying on the ground covered with blood.\n\"All the windows of the bus were broken. Several minutes later, police sealed the spot. Policemen, riot police and armed police could be seen everywhere,\" she added.\n\"Residents were ordered to stay at home or at their (work) units. We are terrified. Many people go to work by taxi or buses provided by the units,\" she said.\nAnother bomb wrecked a Number Two bus, tearing off the roof. The third explosion was on a Number 10 bus, but no details were available.\n\"When I heard the explosion, I felt as if the sky had collapsed,\" said a Uighur witness. \"Many people in the store rushed out to look. I was too terrified to go out.\n\"Today buses are running again, but there are policemen at every station, they check people and bags,\" the witness said.\n\"I hate the people making the explosions. Our life is much better than before. I don't understand why they destroy stability and make trouble for ordinary people.\"\nNumber Two buses have been a target before.\n\"This kind of explosion happened in 1992, I think, as the Number Two bus runs on the major route through downtown,\" said a bus station worker.\n", "International chemicals group Courtaulds Plc said on Wednesday that its wonder-fibre Tencel, global coatings business and fast-growing plastic packaging operations would spearhead expansion in the coming years.\nIn his first major interview since taking the helm last July, chief executive Gordon Campbell laid out his plans for the group, including an increasing focus on fast-growing Asian markets and a determination to move on from its historic role as a major producer of viscose fibres.  \nHe also told Reuters that Courtaulds would play its part in the current global restructuring of the specialty chemicals business through asset swaps, joint ventures and possibly acquisitions.\nHe said Courtaulds was set on expanding Tencel, a highly flexible fibre derived from wood pulp, \"as fast and as profitably as we can\", with annual sales seen approaching $500 million by the turn of the century.  \nBut he added: \"We have to keep reminding people that we have growth prospects in areas other than Tencel, and that people don't think that Courtaulds is a combination of Tencel and viscose. It is Tencel, coatings and polymer products, all of which are capable of growing.\"\nCampbell's other goals include lifting the group's sales in Asia by 10 percent a year, raising sales at Coatings by five percent a year and doubling the proportion of sales derived from the packaging-oriented Polymer business to make it \"a significant third leg\" for Courtaulds.  \nCampbell said growth in Asia would be led by the Coatings business, where Courtaulds had world-leading positions in marine and yacht paints, visible on the P&amp;O luxury liner Oriana, and in aerospace sealants. It is also a major producer of powder coatings for consumer goods.\n\"Marine is always the bridgehead into developing markets, because it is such a well-known and internationally-recognised brand... then we backfill behind that with our other coatings products,\" he said.  \nCampbell said the company had enjoyed annual sales growth in Asia of 15 to 20 percent over the past five years. \"The only reason I scaled it down to 10 percent (as a target) was because it is more difficult to grow at that rate from a bigger base,\" he added.\nPolymers, whose products include toiletry and toothpaste packaging for giants like Unilever Plc and Colgate-Palmolive Co, accounted for less than 10 percent of Courtaulds' 2.30 billion stg sales in the year to March 1996, compared with nearly 50 percent for Coatings and 40 percent for fibres.  \n\"We ought to see it at least doubling over a period of time...Over five years might not be a bad period,\" said Campbell. He said growth would be largely organic, although Courtaulds would be interested in \"small, strategically useful acquisitions\" which expanded product range or geographic spread.\nCampbell said the company was in negotiations with a number of countries in the Far East over the siting of a new production plant for Tencel, which will supplement factories in Alabama in the U.S, and Grimsby, England. He would not be drawn on the timing of an announcement.\n\"Various countries are attempting to attract us. We have three criteria: closeness to the market, country infrastructure ranging from political stability to whether the electricity supply is reliable...and financial incentives.\"\nHe said the costs of investing in Tencel will spark \"a fairly sharp increase in gearing this year, but not to a level we feel concerned about\".\nHe added that \"the real measure\" is interest cover, which is currently around five times. \"We expect to be able to hold it at that,\" Campbell said.\n--London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n", "Chrysler Corp., capping the strongest annual sales performance in its history, said Tuesday it earned $807 million during the fourth quarter of 1996, with special charges holding it back from its best full-year profit ever.\nDetroit's No. 3 automaker reported full-year 1996 net income of $3.53 billion, or $4.77 per common share, compared with $2.025 billion, or $2.65 a share, for calendar-year 1995.\nLast year's results fell short of Chrysler's 1994 record of $3.71 billion because of $347 million in special charges.\nChrysler said it finished 1996 with 2,450,826 U.S. retail vehicle sales, including fleet sales, which broke the 1988 calendar-year record of 2,208,057.\n\"One of the highlights of the year was the fact that according to independent data, Chrysler is the only auto manufacturer to beat industry average in both owner loyalty, or repurchase rate, and new customer conquest rate in 1996,\" Chrysler Chairman Robert J.

We think it's a good deal for consumers,\" he said.\nAmerica Online, which since Dec. 1 has been struggling to deal with an unexpectedly big surge in subscribers, also agreed to halt for a month advertising aimed at attracting new customers.\nThe proposed settlement headed off, for now, consumer fraud lawsuits threatened by at least one state, New York and under consideration by several other states. Several class action lawsuits have been filed against AOL, and AOL said this agreement has nothing to do with the class action lawsuits.\nThe agreement calls for customers to receive graduated refunds of up to $39.90 based on how much time they spent over the past two months logged onto AOL, Ryan said.\nAny customer can demand a free month's service, no questions asked, but the consumer must request the credit.\n\"It's a way of saying thank you to our members for their support,\" said an AOL spokeswoman.\nCase declined to estimate the cost of the refunds, but New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco told a Manhattan news conference he expected the refunds will cost the company several million dollars in his state alone. There are 600,000 AOL members in New York state.\nWall Street analysts said they did not expect the refunds to have much of a financial impact on AOL, because it will be cutting way back on its quarterly marketing expenses, which average about $120 million to $130 million a quarter.\n\"Even if you make some pretty aggressive assumptions about how many people will call for refunds, then you have the number who will qualify,\" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst. \"I come up with $10 to $15 million in terms of cash cost, which will be offset by reduced marketing expenses.\"\nAOL moved to placate angry customers on Jan. 16, telling them it would spend $350 million to upgrade its network, $100 million more than it had announced in December.\nRyan said the pact originally covered 37 states, but said Missouri's attorney general backed out at the last minute to take a closer look at the proposed refunds.\nAOL ran into capacity troubles after it switched its customers from a subscription plan based on the number of hours online to a flat $19.95 monthly rate for unlimited use.\nUnder the agreement announced Wednesday, AOL agreed to cease all new advertising for the month of February unless already contracted for. Vacco said any ads must include a disclaimer that congestion may prevent customers from getting online.\nThe prosecutors had complained America Online was continuing to advertise and sign up new customers even as it could not deliver the service to existing users.\nAOL also agreed to hire additional operators to field calls from customers seeking to cancel the service, and will set up facilities to accept cancellations via mail or fax, in addition to telephone requests. Members had complained they could not cancel the service.\nCustomers in the 36 states also could contact the attorney general's office in that state to file a refund request.\nAttorneys general or their aides from 20 states met last week in Chicago with the company.\n\"If there are fresh complaints, we can still file a lawsuit under the consumer fraud laws,\" Ryan said. \"This does not preclude us from acting on behalf of consumers.\"\n", "Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd said on Tuesday a key report on the Busang gold mystery will be released before North American financial markets open on Monday.\nStrathcona Mineral Services Ltd., the consulting firm hired by Bre-X to audit the project, is expected to issue an interim report on its findings to Bre-X by Friday.\n\"Bre-X expects to release the interim report next Monday morning prior to the opening of financial markets in North America,\" Bre-X spokesman Richard Wool said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.\nWool said reports were wrong that Bre-X was preparing an elaborate press conference in Toronto for the announcement.\nRumors have swirled around Busang since the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. said its preliminary tests found \"insignificant\" amounts of gold.\nPanic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) or 80 percent from the company's stock market value. Since then investors have anxiously awaited Strathcona's findings from Busang, once estimated by Bre-X to contain 71 million ounces of gold.\nBre-X closed up C15 cents at C$3.80 on 5.6 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday.\nFreeport chief executive Jim Bob Moffett said on Tuesday the U.S. mining giant is hoping the Strathcona report will \"add more light\" to the Busang mystery.\n\"Freeport's participation is predicated on the fact that we will go forward and join only if we can confirm an economic deposit,\" Moffett said during the company's annual meeting.\nThe meeting was held under tight security at Freeport's New Orleans headquarters, where shareholders were screened by metal detectors and reporters were sequestered in a seperate room to view the proceedings on closed-circuit television.\nWhile all eyes are on tiny Toronto-based Strathcona, some analysts said its report may only lead to further drilling at the Busang site.\n\"For anything definitive, one would expect a due diligence process that would take more than just six holes drilled by Strathcona and the seven holes (by Freeport). A lot more will have to be done before one has an idea of what is there and what isn't there,\" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.\nAnalysts were divided on whether the granting of Indonesian contracts of work (COW) to two companies related to Bre-X was a good omen for the embattled company.\nBre-X shares soared briefly on Monday after Bro-X Minerals Ltd and Bresea Resources Ltd signed contracts to develop two copper-gold projects.\nThe Indonesian government has put Bre-X's COW for Busang on hold until it completed a review of the company's drilling activities.\n\"I know a lot of people say its irrelevant, but I just can't believe that if the Indonesians felt there was a problem with Bre-X that they would have granted them (Bro-X and Bresea) contracts of work,\" said Norm Duncan, a broker with Vancouver-based C.M. Oliver and Co.\nAnalysts questioned the accuracy of an Indonesian newspaper report on Tuesday which said leaked results of Strathcona's drill tests showed \"cheerful\" grades of gold.\nStrathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada, Indonesia and Australia.\nOnly one or two persons in management at each laboratory will have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished, Strathcona said last Friday.\n", "Britain's United Biscuits (Holdings) Plc expects its margins in Europe to remain firm and to move up over the next two to three years, said managing director Eric Nicoli.\n\"We expect margins to move to 10 percent in all our businesses over a two or three year period,\" said Nicoli in an interview. UB margins are currently at around 10 percent in Britain and four percent in mainland Europe.\n(Corrects to make clear company isn't expecting European margins alone to move by 10 percent over the next two to three years.)\nEarlier the company reported a more than doubling in pretax, pre-exceptional annual profits to 109.1 million stg. UB shares were 7-1/2p higher at 246p in early trade.  \nUB has now entered a phase of consolidation, after a hectic disposal programme, which means the emphasis is on organic growth, said Nicoli.\nOver the last two years the company has sold its American snack operation Keebler, pulled out of Portugal and exited from Spanish snacks. It has also sold one of its Italian snack businesses, withdrawn from Turkey and Brazil and sold Ross Vegetables Products business in Britain.  \n\"The emphasis on organic growth as we are now in a consolidation phase,\" said Nicoli.\nWhen asked about the outlook for the company he said, \"Our markets continue to be very competitive but we expect another year of good progress.\"\nIn Britain, there is a trend among shoppers to switch into higher value lines against a background of improved consumer confidence, said Nicoli.\nIn mainland Europe, he said the company's businesses will improve but it did not expect any help from the markets.\n-- London newsroom +44 171 542 6437\n", "The pace of U.S. bank mergers, which has slowed significantly from last year's record levels, may heat up again as other firms seek to emulate NationsBank's expansion into a major national force.\nNorwest Corp. and Banc One Corp. have been cited as other \"super-regional\" firms that may be shopping for regional banks, said bank and merger experts.\nNationsBank Corp. on Friday announced plans to buy Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. in a $9.5 billion transaction viewed as pricey and daring.\n\"This is going to cause a couple of people to go into action. Those who want to be national players recognize there are only a few opportunities out there,\" said Michael Turillo, partner in charge of the capital strategies group at KPMG Peat Marwick LLP.\nNeither Norwest or Banc One would discuss potential interest in regional acquisitions.\n\"Our strategy is to add value to shareholders and acquisitions are one avenue to reach that goal,\" said Norwest spokesman Lawrence Haeg.\nThe aggressive move by NationsBank to buy Boatmen's is somewhat unusual in the latest wave of banking mergers because it will greatly extend the reach of the North Carolina-based bank. Many of the other transactions seen in the past two years have been in-market acquisitions that have resulted in large cost savings and branch closings.\nExperts noted that serious questions remain about the success rate of major geographical expansion through acquisitions. For example, First Union Corp.'s acquisition last year of First Fidelity, which employed the same strategy as NationsBank, has fallen short of expectations.\nIndeed, bank merger activity has already been capped this year by high prices and widespread concern that expansion will reduce the ability to cut costs -- a strategy that has been key to corporate mergers in the mid-1990s.\n\"There aren't so many obvious combinations left,\" said Ed Dillon, banking merger analyst at SNL Securities.\nIn the first half of 1996, bank merger activity tumbled 54 percent to $9.7 billion from $21 billion in the first half of 1995, according to Mergerstat Review, a unit of Los Angeles-based investment bank Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin.\n\"With so many huge deals from last year, a lot of banks are just now coming up for air,\" said Susan Michaelson, managing director of Michaelson Kelbick Partners Inc., a New York-based firm that assists banks with post-merger marketing and communications.\nShares of regional banks rose sharply Friday on views that some of those banks may once again be acquisition targets. In a broadly lower market, U.S. Bancorp rose 1-9/16 to 38-1/2,, First Tennessee National gained 1 to 34-3/8 and First Commerce Corp. rose 1/4 to 35-3/4.\nU.S. Bancorp \"has been and remains a very interesting acquisition candidate if somebody wants into the Northwest,\" said Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.\nBut analysts also noted that potential buyers are likely to be extremely sensitive about investor response to acquisition opportunities.

It hopes to gain 67 billion yen ($540 million) from the real estate sales and will also eliminate 600 jobs to cut costs.\nDespite the moves, NCB president Hiroshi Kubota told a news conference that he cannot rule out the possibility of a tie-up or merger with other banks in the future.\nEarlier on Tuesday, NCB put three non-bank financial affiliates under bankruptcy protection.\nAs a long-term credit bank, NCB raises cash through issuing debentures rather than taking deposits.\nThe Japanese government, which has spoken of the benefits of deregulation and leaving the market alone, has taken a strong hand in ensuring that NCB survives, urging other banks to accept newly floated shares to help it rebuild its capital base.\nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) also said it planned to use 80 billion yen ($645 million) from a special fund created to cope with bad loans from the collapse of \"jusen\" housing loan firms.\nFinance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference that the capital increase and disposing of bad loans \"will substantially improve NCB's business foundation and will contribute to the stability of financial systems both at home and abroad\".\nFinancial analysts have criticised the NCB plan, saying it would further weigh down other big banks, which are themselves in far from robust financial health.\nHokkaido Takushoku Bank, Japan's 10th-largest commercial bank, meanwhile, said it will merge with the smaller Hokkaido Bank Ltd and cease overseas operations to become a \"super-regional\" bank.\nSuch super-regionals use their local power base to build a large presence that rivals their big-city competitors.\nHokkaido Takushoku said it had no choice but to retrench, ending lofty ambitions of being a global player in the banking world.\n\"We made the decision (on the overseas pullout) believing that it was inevitable to ensure leverage in our business while promoting bad loan write-offs,\" it said in a statement.\nHokkaido Takushoku said it and Hokkaido Bank would merge as equals by April 1998.\nBoth are headquartered in Sapporo, the largest city on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.\nThe merger will cut costs at the two banks and mean the elimination of 2,000 jobs.\nIt will also help Hokkaido Takushoku face its mountain of bad debts. The bank has long been considered the most troubled of Japan's major city banks and a merger candidate.\nAs part of the new focus it will shut down its six overseas branches in locations including New York and London and seven representative offices.

Williamson is facing a string of lawsuits, including 24 cases brought by individual states to recover funds spent on treating patients with tobacco-related illnesses.\nSpeaking after the group released flat first quarter pre-tax profits, B.A.T chief executive Martin Broughton declined to comment on recent press reports that the industry may be in negotiations over a possible $300 billion settlement of the lawsuits.\nBroughton also would not comment on suggestions that the tobacco industry may be able to rely on insurance cover to offset the claims.\nThe issue of insurance, he said, was complex both factually and legally, with many different policies containing many different exclusion clauses.\nSchroders insurance analyst Paul Hodges in a recent research note argued that loosely worded general liability insurance policies could open the way for claims by the tobacco industry against their insurance companies.\nOn Wednesday, B.A.T reported a one million pound ($1.6 million) rise in group pre-tax profits to 591 million pounds in the first three months of the year.\nBut the company repeated a warning made at last week's annual shareholders meeting that if the strength of the British currency persisted it may hold back the group's full-year results.\nB.A.T shares eased slightly after the broadly in-line figures, shedding 1-1/2 pence to 522-1/2 pence by early afternoon.\nTotal trading profit from B.A.T's financial services business rose three percent to 266 million, with the general business slightly ahead at 142 million pounds and the life companies showing a six percent rise to 124 million pounds.\nIn North America, insurer Farmers made an encouraging start to the year with all round business growth fuelling a six percent rise in profits to 163 million pounds. But market conditions remained difficult for B.A.T's British business where profits fell two million pounds to 77 million pounds.\nWhile the company expects further rises in premiums in the coming year, it anticipates increases to be limited.\nAsked about the recent consolidation in the industry Broughton said the company remained \"alert to acquisition opportunities\" but did not feel the need to do anything urgently.\nRe-emphasising comments made last year, he said, the group lacked a strong brand in the independent financial advisory segment of the market and that was likely to be the focus of the group's acqusition appetite.\nTotal tobacco profit of 363 million pounds would have risen by eight percent but for a 22 million pound provision for the future closure of a cigarette factory in the German capital Berlin, which reduced the increase to two percent.\nTotal group cigarette volumes rose slightly to 167 billion pounds, with good gains in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa and Europe more than compensating for reduced sales in North America.\nTobacco profit from the America-Pacific region was lower at 140 million pounds in the first quarter. Reduced sales in a very competitive U.S. domestic market and the loss of contribution from the sale of brands disposed of at the end of 1996 as required by U.S. competition authorities, more than offset the benefit of last year's price increase.\nB.A.T's American subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson saw lower shipments and its market share fell to 16.3 percent from 17.5 percent, mainly due to the sale of the brands.

In 1991 it was punished by regulators for improperly favouring certain clients.\nIn a separate case, news reports on Monday linked Yamaichi Securities Co to illegal deals, sparking threats of libel action by the firm.\nSuzuki said that, while he had expected to transfer the company's management to the next generation after regaining public trust, Nomura's current situation was serious, requiring sweeping changes.\n\"Nomura is experiencing the worst crisis since it was founded,\" he said.\nHe said that Nomura was facing difficult problems, including continued investigation by regulators and expected administrative punishment by the Finance Ministry.\nHe also said Nomura's clients had increasingly been suspending business with the brokerage since the beginning of April and Nomura's employees were receiving complaints from customers.\nHideo Sakamaki, who resigned as Nomura's president last month when the scandal broke, said earlier on Tuesday that the company had paid more than 70 million yen ($555,000) via stock deals into accounts linked to a racketeer.\nSakamaki, who was testifying before a committee of the Upper House of parliament, said that one of the irregular stock deals included a transaction involving more than seven million shares in a commercial bank on March 15, 1993.\nIt was the first time a Nomura insider had publicly revealed the amount of money transferred to the racketeer.\nA Japanese news service reported on Tuesday that the Ministry of Finance was likely to suspend some of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as punishment for the scandal.\nAsked if there were accounts at Nomura linked to other racketeers, Sakamaki said that he believed there were no such accounts.\nHe said that while he believed that only two former directors, who resigned last month, were involved in the payoffs, he was also responsible himself as Nomura's top manager at the time for causing the scandal.\nHe said that Nomura would work out measures to avoid a recurrence of such a scandal.

ADM has charged that Whitacre allegedly stole about $9 million from it.\nWhitacre has denied those charges, saying he received the money in off-the-books payments that allegedly were authorised by ADM officials.\nIn October 1996, as part of the antitrust probe, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of fixing prices of lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, which is used in food, beverages and other products. ADM agreed to pay $100 million in fines, a record for antitrust actions.\nIn December 1996, Whitacre was indicted for allegedly conspiring to fix prices of lysine. Also indicted at that time were Michael Andreas, former vice chairman of ADM and son of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, a former group vice president.\nWhitacre, Michael Andreas and Wilson have pleaded not guilty to those charges.\nIn his lawsuit, filed in Urbana, Ill., Whitacre said he had repeatedly discussed with Shepard a grant of immunity in exchange for cooperating with the antitrust investigation.\nWhitacre said he wanted to seek out an attorney regarding his role as a informer. He alleged that Shepard kept him from obtaining an attorney, in violation of his constitutional rights under the 1st and 5th Amendments.\nWhitacre also claimed in his lawsuit that there were episodes when Shepard allegedly became \"angry, shouted, directed abusive language\" toward him and threatened him with criminal prosecution if he sought the counsel of an attorney.\nIn the lawsuit, Whitacre also claimed that in late February or early March 1993, Shepard allegedly struck him with a hard-sided briefcase.\nHe further charged that Shepard kept him from seeking medical treatment for depression and suicidal tendencies, which exacerbated his manic depression.\nWhitacre said he attempted suicide on Aug. 9, 1995.\nSeparately, in U.S. District Court in Chicago, Cheil Jedang Ltd. of Seoul, South Korea, entered a guilty plea to charges of fixing lysine prices. The company agreed to pay a $1.25 million fine, which was suspended until the end of the ADM litigation.\n", "Lloyd's of London announced Tuesday it will give backers more time to meet planned increases in the capital they must put up to support their underwriting activities.\nLloyd's has also dropped proposals to prevent Names -- as the traditional backers of the insurance market are called -- from using their own homes as collateral for underwriting.\nThe planned capital increases are part of a package of measures designed to strengthen the financial security that underpins Lloyd's and to provide a level playing field between Names and corporate members.\nThe longer transition period for the changes announced Tuesday may go some way to meeting the concerns of Names' representatives, who had called for more time to be given to meet the new capital requirements.\nNames fear they are gradually being forced out of the market in favour of corporate capital first introduced in 1994, a charge repeatedly denied by the Lloyd's hierachy.\nNames are to be given three years before they have to meet the new requirements of showing evidence of assets amounting to 50 percent of the premiums they underwrite.\nIn a Lloyd's working party report last month, a two-year transition period was proposed but, after consultations, that has been extended from 1999 to the year 2000.\nA phased increase in Names' minimum level of means to 350,000 pounds ($571,000) from the current level of 250,000 pounds ($409,000) has also been increased from two to five years and will take effect in 2002.\nThis 350,000 pounds ($571,000) will be made up of funds held at Lloyd's and evidence of \"other personal wealth\" (OPW).\nProposals to double the OPW requirements for 2000 and beyond have been dropped in favour of a slightly higher level of funds which must be held at Lloyd's.\nAt present, Names must put up between 20 percent and 30 percent of the total business they back, compared with 50 percent for corporate members.\nBy 2000, Names will have to hold 40 percent of premium capacity at Lloyd's with OPW making up a further 10 percent, bringing them into line with corporate members.\nThe use of \"principal private residences\" (PPRs) -- Names' own homes -- as collateral for members' underwriting will be allowed to continue but only for those in existence at the end of 1994.\nThe Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM), which represents Names' interests, broadly welcomed Tuesday's proposals, saying it was essential that all Names should demonstrate their ability to meet any losses they incurred.\n", "Australia's oldest newspaper group John Fairfax Holdings Ltd is expected to unveil sharply lower 1996/97 half year earnings on Friday, but analysts say the results may show the worst is over.\nMedia analysts contacted by Reuters estimated Fairfax to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$37 million and A$42 million for the first half. Fairfax reported a 23.2 percent fall in net profit to A$62.43 million for the 1995/96 half.  \nHowever, they said the result should show improving advertising revenue in the second quarter, along with lower newsprint costs.\n\"They have certainly seen a pick up in ad volumes. It is still down on last year but nowhere near as much down as in the first quarter,\" said Nola Hodgson, analyst at HSBC James Capel. Hodgson tips a net profit of A$38 million to A$39 million, with the dividend remaining at 3.5 cents for the half.\nVince Pepe at broker Burdett Buckeridge and Young estimated Fairfax to report a net profit of A$40 million for the half and A$75.1 million for the 1996/97 year.  \nFairfax reported a net profit before abnormals of A$102 million in the 1995/96 year (July/June).\nFairfax profits have been tumbling for the past 18 months on higher newsprint costs and falling advertising revenue, the latter a sign of a weak labour market.\n\"The pick-up in the ANZ job ads was some encouragement,\" Pepe said.\nOn Monday, the closely-watched ANZ job advertisment series for January rose a seasonally adjusted 3.3 percent, the largest gain in a year.  \n\"Ad volumes are still down, but we are starting to see signs of life in real estate and employment,\" James Capel's Hodgson said.\nOne Sydney-based analyst forecast Fairfax to report a net profit of A$37 million, while another, who also asked not to be named, estimated the newspaper publisher to report a net profit of A$42 million.\nAnalysts were mixed about the second half as the first six months is traditionally Fairfax's stronger with advertising volumes associated with the Christmas period usually boosting the bottom line.  \nKerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) owns about 15 percent of Fairfax and has never been shy of his intention to own Fairfax.\n\"This is not a company about earnings. The key issue is whether Packer is going to make a bid for it,\" the analyst said.\nCanadian media baron Conrad Black sold his 25 percent Fairfax stake last year, frustrated by the government's refusal to change foreign ownership laws for Australian media assets, which prevented Black from securing 50 percent control as he wished.  \nAnalysts expect Fairfax to report an annual net profit of between A$75 million to A$84 million, an indication that some are forecasting a stronger second half.\nFairfax's classified advertisments, which were dubbed by media baron Rupert Murdoch as \"rivers of gold\", are often viewed as a reflection of the Australian economy. Most economists tip the local economy to grow stronger in 1997.\nHowever, another media analyst, who also asked not to be named, said the market was not really concerned about Fairfax earnings and was instead preoccupied with a potential change in Australia's media ownership laws, which are under review.  \nBlack sold a 19.9 percent stake to New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd.

It agreed in January to develop vaccines using Medeva's expertise in creating non-injectable drugs and earlier this month licensed its portfolio of allergy vaccines to SmithKline Beecham.\nDespite these high profile agreements, which have seen Peptide shares soar this year, Brown said there was still plenty in the cupboard to attract new partners. He said there was \"huge potential for our technology platforms,\" which include methods for discovering new vaccines and protease inhibitors, a class of drugs which help stop viruses from reproducing.  \nBrown said the company would also be interested in finding partners to help develop early stage vaccines against Meningitis B and Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV), a breathing disorder which affects young children. Peptide is also looking at using peptides against rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and at using its vaccine technology for animal health.\nBrown , said that Peptide, which floated on the stock market in November 1995, was now changing gear. \"We are entering the third phase of the company. Phase one was the venture capital, pre-flotation stage and in phase two we built up the company and established a solid base.\"  \nPeptide has built its Cambridge, England, headquarters up in the past 12 months to 77 staff from 28, and Brown said this could move to \"between 90 and 100 over the next year.\"\nBrown, who has relinquished the finance director's post to become chief executive, said the company was in a strong cash position, with 27.4 million stg of cash on its books.\n\"The burn rate may increase marginally this year to seven or eight million stg\" from 6.5 million in 1996, Brown added.\n--London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n", "With the memory of Thailand's banking sector implosion still fresh, alarm bells are starting to sound about banks' property exposure in Hong Kong.\nMassive capital inflows into the territory, most driven by optimism about Hong Kong's reversion to China at midnight on June 30, have fuelled an explosion in bank loans for property.\nThe enthusiasm evokes memories of the building boom that helped push Thailand to the brink of economic collapse earlier this year, with banks weighted under by bad loans.\nWidely viewed as Hong Kong's most accurate confidence indicator, soaring property prices are considered by many people to be yet another sign that all is well with the territory's handover to China just around the corner.\nBut others are urging officials to check out the foundations on which the boom is built.\n\"There appears to be an assumption among Hong Kong bankers -- not to mention their clients -- that they can print as much money as needed to keep property and other asset prices in orbit indefinitely,\" said Hugh Peyman in a recent report by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (DKB).\nDavid Lui, director at Schroder Securities, took up the same issue at a public forum on Tuesday.\n\"If property prices continue to rise, that will affect the soundness (of the financial sector),\" Lui said.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the territory's de facto central bank, warned late last month that additional restraints in mortgage lending might be required, taking some of the steam out of Hong Kong's hyperactive stock market.\nProfit-taking hit property counters on Wednesday despite the Hang Seng Index's overall recovery from early lows.

Property and construction now account for 47 percent of all Hong Kong lending, Peyman said.\n\"These massive increases in property lending have taken place against a backdrop of the lowest new supply of residential flats in 23 years,\" he said.\nMortgage loans now account for 22 percent of all loans, and loans to developers have hit HK$363 billion (US$46.5 billion) -- up 18 percent over six months and 30 percent over one year.\nHong Kong's fixed exchange rate and open capital account leave the HKMA very little room to manoeuvre to calm the frenzy, except to resort to aggressive hands-on lending restrictions.\nLocal banks are already restricted to a 40 percent property exposure, but the HKMA has no control over foreign banks who usually enter late in a boom and give the biggest boost to lending as they grab for market share at any cost.\nDKB said the figures are worrying enough to suggest tougher HKMA action to dampen down credit expansion before the September International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting in Hong Kong.\nBut other analysts adopted a more sanguine view.\nThe start-up of a new mortgage corporation later this year will eat up some of the banks loans as property debts are securitised, said Clive McDonnell, economist at SocGen Crosby.\nMore important than lending restrictions are plans already announced by the new Hong Kong government to increase supply.\n\"There has been a level of excess liquidity and that's been feeding through into property prices,\" McDonnell said. \"However, long-term trends will affect the short term.

They said it would be inappropriate to do so before an application is submitted and city leaders decide where the casino can be built.\nMichigan voters last November approved legislation that would grant three licenses for operating casinos in Detroit, making it the largest American city to have legalised gambling.\nTwo local gambling groups that financed the pro-gambling lobbying efforts last fall are presumed to be in line for two of the licenses. Those companies are Greektown Casino LLC and Atwater Entertainment Inc.\nIn addition to MGM Grand, casino operators that have expressed interest in Detroit include Harrahs Entertainment Inc., Mirage Resorts Inc. and Circus-Circus Enterprises Inc.\nLas Vegas-based MGM is known for its glitzy, entertainment-themed casinos, and Lanni made clear he envisions something similar for Detroit -- possibly involving a Motown theme.\n\"We're in the gaming entertainment business. We're competing for the entertainment dollar. Unless you have something that is very special, that is something people want to visit and re-visit, you're going to lose out to other entertainment venues,\" Lanni said.\nIn addition to its reputation, Lanni boasted that MGM has the financial might to build a casino and possibly a hotel in Detroit. The company has received a commitment to boost its line of credit to $1 billion from $600 million.\nLanni also stressed that MGM is a good corporate citizen that would help revitalise the lagging downtown Detroit area if its application was approved. But in an ironic twist, standing behind Lanni at the briefing was Alex Yemenidjian, MGM's president and chief operating officer.\nYemenidjian, who said nothing at the press conference, was a key part of the hostile takeover attempt of Chrysler Corp. by MGM controlling shareholder Kirk Kerkorian in April 1995.

She said she had produced a television report for Fox station WSVN Channel 7 on cigarette marketing, scheduled for broadcast that evening. Despite tobacco lawyers objections, she was placed in the pool of potential jurors to sit on the trial, expected to last eight weeks or longer.\nTobacco company lawyers again on Thursday asked Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye to remove the freelance news producer, saying her piece negatively portrayed tobacco companies and reflected a bias making her unsuitable to fairly decide whether the defendants are liable for the smoking-related illnesses of 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants.\nA tape of the short television report on flashily packaged Black Death, City and other so-called micro-brand cigarettes favored by some young smokers was shown in court and included interviews with shopkeepers, young smokers and a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society.\nStanley Rosenblatt, an attorney pressing the class-action suit, said the television report had been very likely edited by other journalists and did not necessarily reflect the mindset of the news producer.\nBut Kaye sided with the tobacco lawyers and removed the woman from the standby jurors pool, saying, \"The appearance that it was weighted would make it inappropriate for her to be seated.\"\nAfter four days of jury selection, the standby jurors pool numbers 18. Some 60 are needed to seat a jury of six. A second round of screening will be required to find between six and 12 alternates before testimony can begin in the landmark trial, a court official said.\nA nurse, a college student and an immigrant from Mexico were placed in the standby pool on Thursday. People excused by Kaye include a nun who described smoking as a vice and the sure cause of diseases she has seen firsthand as a nurse and several people with schooling or vacation plans fixed firmly during June and July.\nKaye late on Wednesday said he was reconsidering a Rosenblatt request that prospective jurors be questioned in groups as a way of speeding up jury selection.

Kaye earlier this week refused a similar request from Rosenblatt.\nJury questioning for the trial, the first on secondhand smoke claims, is likely to run through at least mid-June, in part because the jury selection next week will occur only on Monday and Tuesday because of a break for Jewish holidays.\nAMB.N\n", "The Czech Republic appeared headed for its first budget deficit despite earlier reports by the fiscally-tough government that it had achieved a surplus in 1996 for the fourth successive year.\n\"(We expect) the definitive results for 1996 will range around a deficit of 1.7 billion crowns ($61.77 million),\" Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said on Wednesday in testimony to parliament's budget committtee.\nThe Czechs have had three surplus budgets since Czechoslovakia split in two in 1993.\nFinal data were due in the ministry on Wednesday but as local media paid close attention to whether Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus would maintain his fiscal winning streak, Havel said the trend was not positive.\nHe said that by Wednesday revenues totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.5 billion.\nMore bills may be delivered after the deadline, inflating expenditures further, Havel said.\nThe government made last-ditch efforts in December when the budget looked headed for a more than five billion crown deficit, by freezing some outlays until 1997, and requiring early repayment on credit granted to a deposit insurance fund.\nThe budget has been hampered by lower-than-expected tax revenue and delayed repayment on credits to Russia.\nThe 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of spending cuts knocked the spending forecast down to 491 billion crowns.\nParliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome, but he was concerned with the effects government payment adjustments might have on the 1997 budget.\nThe December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which were due to the partly-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s.\nKlaus, who calls balanced budgets the \"alpha and omega\" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus, made by the finance ministry soon after the new year, as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility.\nParliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with spending and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.\nBut the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for 1996.\nMany have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep at bay a deficit much larger than that for 1996.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=27.52 Czech Crown)\n", "3Com Corp and U.S. Robotics Corp's merger promises to create a second powerhouse in the data networking industry capable of competing head-to-head in the Internet access business with Cisco Systems Inc.\nThe merger, valued at $6.6 billion in stock, represents the largest such deal ever in the computer network industry.\nBut analysts were divided on whether the merger by two of the top six network equipment suppliers will be strong enough to offer end-to-end network connections on the scale of Cisco.  \n\"No more Cisco and the Seven Dwarfs,\" Bear Stearns analyst Eric Blachno said, invoking an analogy frequently heard in the industry to describe Cisco's dominant market leadership.\n\"It appears the Cisco has acquired a large competitor,\" he said in reaction to the latest industry consolidation move.\nHowever, veteran industry analyst Frank Dzubeck questioned the viability of combining the two companies in light of precedents set by previous mega-mergers in the industry.  \n\"This could be another Bay-Wellfleet-Synoptics deal,\" he said, referring to the 1994 merger that formed Bay Networks Inc, a union seen as running aground over conflicts in integrating product lines, company cultures and managements.\nSimilarly, Dzubeck, president of Communications Networks Architects Inc, an industry consulting firm, said 3Com and U.S. Robotics represented \"two cultures, two different product streams, two managements.\"\n\"A lot depends on how they meet the organizational challenges,\" the analyst said of the complexities inherent in combining companies centered about 2,000 miles apart.  \n3Com is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley, while U.S. Robotics is located in Skokie, Ill.\n3Com is known as the leading maker of network adapter cards used to connect personal computers to office networks. Roughly 40 percent of its $2.3 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues were derived from adapter card sales, analysts say.\nBy contrast, Robotics is the top maker of computer modems for consumers and other products providing Internet access.\nThe $1.9 billion company also sells switchboard-like data communications hubs, which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use to handle scores of simultaneous incoming consumer calls.  \n\"The whole concept of those two companies getting together is a very strong one,\" said Paul Deninger, chief executive of Broadview Associates, a high-technology investment banking firm, when asked Tuesday to speculate on rumors of the merger.\n\"Robotics is a remote access company,\" Deninger said. \"3Com has no remote access strategy. This provides them one.\"\nWhile Deninger is an active dealmaker in the networking industry -- completing 24 smaller technology acquisition deals in the last 18 months -- the latest merger was managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according to the companies.  \nIn a conference call, executives of the two companies said 3Com's strength as a corporate equipment supplier and U.S. Robotics' strong retail presence would allow the company to compete in both local-area and wide-area networks.\nBut several industry analaysts said rather than allowing 3Com to compete head-to-head in every market segment of the networking industry, the merger was best seen as allowing it to create a defensible niche in important segments.  \n3Com Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Benhamou acknowledged as much in saying his company's strengths lie at what he called \"the edge of the network\" -- selling products to connect office workers and consumers to computer networks.\n\"We are much stronger at the edge of the network,\" Benhamou said, allowing that archrival Cisco dominates the core of office networks and long-distance \"backbone\" networks.\nCisco's strength in the larger network equipment used to build these portions of computer networks was bolstered by a major acquisition of its own last April, when it paid about $4 billion to acquire Stratacom Inc.  \nThe combination of 3Com and Robotics comes no where near Cisco in several vital respects. Their combined revenues are running at roughly $5 billion a year, officials said, compared with Cisco's current annual run rate of more than $6 billion.\nBut Cisco's daunting advantages become more apparent when the underlying growth rates of the companies are compared.\nWhile the 3Com and Robotics businesses are estimated to be growing at 40 percent per year -- a healthy rate by most any industry measure -- Cisco continues to outrun all major competitors by its explosive 80 percent per year pace.\n\"That's an amazing growth rate,\" Deninger said of Cisco's market momentum. \"Especially since no one else in the industry is growing faster than 40 percent,\" he said.\nAcross a variety of measures Cisco remains the dominant player in the industry, followed by a 3Com/Robotics combination, Bay Networks Inc and Cabletron Systems Inc.\n((New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736))\n", "Federal-Mogul Corp., dropping its four-year effort to build a global auto parts retail empire, unveiled a massive restructuring Thursday that returns it to its core manufacturing and distribution business.\nThe Southfield, Mich.-based company said it took a total of $264 million in pre-tax charges to cover the restructuring and special one-time items from the fourth quarter.\nFederal-Mogul, which has about $2 billion in annual sales, also said it will slash about 2,900 jobs, equal to 18.5 percent of its worldwide work force of 15,700.\nThe charges resulted in a net loss of $220.2 million for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $49.1 million for the 1995 period.\nFor all of 1996, the company lost $211.1 million, but would have posted a profit of $34.7 million before special items. In 1995 the company lost $9.7 million.\n\"We have realigned our growth strategy behind our core competencies of engineering, manufacturing and distribution,\" Chairman Dick Snell said in a statement. \"Our retail operations are good viable businesses that can be operated better by someone else.\"\nThe company makes a wide variety of products, ranging from engine bearings, oil seals and pistons to lighting and electrical components, for the auto, farm and construction vehicle industry.\nFederal Mogul stock closed up 87.5 cents at $24.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nSnell, the former CEO of Tenneco Inc.'s automotive business, joined Federal-Mogul in early November. He earned high praise from analysts Thursday for his swift action and straightforward explantion of where the company is headed.\n\"This is the kind of stock where if the numbers work out, the stock is going to work out, because people want to like him,\" said Salomon Brothers analyst Darren Kimball.\nNicholas Colas, an analyst at CS First Boston, said the restructuring makes sense because the firm tried to expand in an area where it had no in-house retail expertise.\n\"Basically, the grand vision of having an international third world distribution and retail business is gone,\" he said. \"This is much more playing to the company's historical strengths.\"\nIncluded in the restructuring is the planned sale of 132 international retail operations in Australia, Chile, Ecuador, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Africa, and Venezuela, and the planned sale or restructuring of about 30 wholesale operations in 10 countries.\nThe firm also plans to relocate product lines in its European manufacturing operations and cut the work force; consolidate lighting products in Juarez, Mexico; and close a manufacturing facility in Indiana. The company also plans to close two distribution warehouses in Kentucky, consolidate customer support functions in the United States and streamline administration and operational staff functions worldwide.\nThe moves are a complete reversal of the efforts by former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Gormley, who was forced to resign in September after pressure from the board.\nSnell said in an interview that future restructuring in North America and Europe are likely, which could result in more job losses over the next few years, although not on the scale of Thursday's announcement.\nAt the same time, the firm will be on the lookout for acquisitions that could add to its core businesses, he said. For instance, since Federal-Mogul makes engine bearings, it makes sense for it also to offer pistons, Snell said.\n", "China bank deposits grew last year, albeit more slowly than in 1995 due to two interest rate cuts, and would remain the top choice for private investors due to a lack of other opportunities, state media said on Sunday.\nHowever, investment funds, which have so far failed to attract investors and exist on only a tiny scale, could become a target for private funds in 1997, the China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday.\nInvestment in housing and insurance could become alternatives this year after small investors burnt their fingers in the stock markets and in corporate bonds and failed to buy state debt due to enormous competition, it said.\nStamps, coins, antiques and art -- targets of the destructive fervour of Red Guards in the radical 1966-76 Cultural Revolution -- would continue to play an important role in the portfolios of families with money to save, it said.\nNew bank deposits in China in January to November totalled 820.19 billion yuan ($98.82 billion), up 12 percent year-on-year, but with growth sharply down from the skyrocketing 37.7 percent increase for all of 1995, the newspaper said.\nTotal private savings in China's banks amounted to 3,791.73 billion yuan at the end of November, it said.\nA sharp cut in retail inflation, to about 6.0 percent from 14.48 percent in 1995, persuaded many individuals to put their money in the banks, it quoted central bank economist Zhao Haikuan as saying. China uses retail inflation as its benchmark, mainly because consumer inflation remains higher -- at about 8.0 percent -- showing little incentive to save in banks.\nThe interest rate on one-year deposits stood at 7.47 percent, lower than the 10.98 percent offered in 1995 but well above inflation, Zhao said.\nAlthough China's two stock markets in Shanghai and southern Shenzhen had now attracted 21 million investors -- and drew more than 10,000 new punters a day between October to early December -- the limited size of the exchanges and their volatility were deterrents, the Business Weekly quoted analysts as saying.\nIn addition, a state debt issue of 195.2 billion yuan last year fell far short of absorbing the more than 800 billion yuan in new deposits, Zhao said. China is expected to float up to 250 billion state debt in 1997, nearly one-third more than in 1996.\nHe ruled out a substantial drop in personal bank deposits as a result of the lower interest rates and saw little likelihood of a flood of consumer spending.\nBank savings would remain the first choice for individuals in 1997, ahead of stocks and bonds, Zhao said.\nOfficials were eager to lure deposits into China's state-owned banks, saddled with huge bad debts from state-owned enterprises and still required to help out state firms identified as strategic by the central government.\nInvestment funds were seen absorbing surplus cash this year as more stocks and corporate bonds are floated in 1997, the Business Weekly said, quoting a report by leading brokerage China Securities Co Ltd.\nBy 1996, China had set up 75 funds and of these 25 were listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen. The listed funds accounted for just 5.0 percent of all equities, with their market value estimated at about 11 million yuan, or 2.5 percent of total trading volume, the Business Weekly said.\nOnly three funds have capital of more than 200 million yuan, while 70 percent are smaller than 100 million yuan. Few have invested in equities, preferring to put their money into property. Stocks and bonds account for less than 10 percent of their total investment, it said.\n", "Breakfast cereal price wars may make consumers smile, but they're putting frowns on faces at some of the nation's largest cereal makers.\nIndustry analysts said Kellogg Co., the No. 1 cereal maker, is expected to report flat earnings for the latest quarter, while Ralcorp Holdings Inc., a big maker of store brand cereal, was likely to report lower earnings.\nPrice cuts and promotions in the $9 billion cereal business have hurt results at both companies, analysts said.\nKellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., has lost sales to competitors such as General Mills Inc., its biggest rival, which cut prices early last year. General Mills' earnings rose 7.5 percent in its latest quarter, on an increase in market share sparked partly by promotions.\nThe price cutting, started by Post Cereal, forced Kellogg, General Mills and others to follow suit. Post, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. Inc., does not report results separately.\nKellogg said in November that it would take steps to counter the price cuts and other promotions that eroded its market share to about 33 percent from 35 percent, analysts said.\nWhile its counterattacks appear to be paying off -- analysts said Kellogg's market share seems to have risen a bit in December -- they are also pressuring earnings.\n\"(Kellogg's) domestic earnings are clearly going to be down on lower sales and some increase in marketing spending,\" said Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez.\nIn October Kellogg said earnings fell 31 percent in the third quarter, hurt by promotions by rivals. It pledged at the time that earnings growth would resume in the fourth quarter, analysts said, but most are forecasting flat or slightly lower results. For the 1995 fourth quarter, Kellogg earned $166.7 million, or 77 cents a share.\nKellogg also moved to diversify its breakfast food business last month when it bought Lender's Bagels from Kraft Foods Inc. for $455 million.\nQuaker Oats Co., a maker of cereals and other food products, is expected to report an operating profit for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss a year ago. But Quaker is also expected to take a charge in the quarter to write down the value of its Snapple beverage business.\n\"The issue for Quaker is how big of a charge they take for Snapple,\" said BT Securities analyst John O'Neil.\nQuaker said in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it was reviewing a possible writeoff related to Snapple. A Quaker spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of a charge in the fourth quarter.\nAmong other food companies, Sara Lee Corp. is expected to report a strong increase in earnings, with the biggest improvement in its meat and bakery division, said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach.\nAnalysts said CPC International Inc., which makes Hellman's mayonnaise, Mazola corn oil, Skippy peanut butter and Thomas' English muffins, would report a smaller than normal rise in quarterly earnings, due to high corn costs. Corn refining accounts for 15 percent of CPC's sales, which were $8.4 billion in 1995.\n", "Comerica Inc. said Wednesday it will cut 1,890 jobs, or about 16 percent of its work force, as part of an effort to slash costs and boost revenues by $110 million annually by the first half of 1998.\nThe Detroit-based banking company said the restructuring actions caused it to incur a $90 million pretax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings, which fell to $60.8 million, or 52 cents a share, from $106.5 million, or 92 cents a share, in the year-ago period.\nComerica, with $34 billion in assets at the end of 1996, said the actual number of employees to be laid off may be less than 1,890 because of attrition, a hiring freeze and reinvestment actions.\nThe company has about 12,000 employees in Michigan, Texas, California and Florida. The cuts will fall in all four states and will take place between now and mid-1998, Comerica said.\n\"Regrettably, as we streamline processes and eliminate redundancies, a number of employees throughout the corporation will be displaced,\" Comerica Chairman Eugene Miller said in a statement. \"To assist these employees, we have put in place an enhanced severance plan with out placement services to help their transition.\"\nComerica also said it planned to close about a dozen branch offices.\nComerica, Michigan's largest independent bank holding company, has been the subject of merger speculation in the past year. However, it has steadfastly maintained it is not interested in being acquired by an out-of-state bank and has instead embarked on a long effort to streamline its operations.\nComerica said the third phase of its restructuring effort includes other initiatives to reduce costs and enhance revenues. They include:\n-- Eliminating one-third of paper forms and replacing them with electronic forms.\n-- Simplifying the referral and delivery of investment services.\n-- Giving branch employees more authority and reducing their clerical duties so they can serve customers better.\n-- Reducing the documentation required to open a new account.\n-- Streamlining the credit approval process.\n-- Streamlining financial and operations reporting.\nFor the full year, Comerica earned $417.2 million, or $3.55 a share, up from $413.4 million, or $3.54 a share, in 1995.\n", "\"Don't puff up an ox skin,\" Chinese say to braggarts, but in the Year of the Ox, China expects to have much to puff about.\n\"It is a good time to settle domestic affairs and put your house in order,\" says a horoscope in The Handbook of Chinese Horoscopes by Theodora Lau for the year that begins on Friday.\nChina's communist rulers have already started to make sure their house is in order for the arrival of the ox, but they will have to toil like farm beasts to push through their ambitious agenda.\nChina's leaders have already taken the theme that 1997 will be one of the most significant years in the history of the People's Republic -- founded by Chairman Mao Zedong in the Year of the Ox in 1949 -- as their signature tune for the year.\nHong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30 after more than 150 years of British colonial control, and a crucial Communist Party congress that will chart China's path for the next five years is to be held later in the year.\n\"The Year of the Ox will be an auspicious year,\" Foreign Minister Qian Qichen recently predicted.\nHe invoked bovine metaphors to try to soothe worries over the change of sovereignty in Hong Kong amid protests against Beijing's plans to roll back civil rights in the territory.\n\"With lowered heads we are working as hard as oxen,\" said Qian, who heads the committee handling Hong Kong's return.\nMany Chinese bureaucrats have already been yoked into the task of preparing the enormous document that will be issued when China's most powerful officials gather late in the year for the five-yearly Communist Party congress that will reshuffle top jobs and set policy into the 21st century.\nThe new party line and who will get what job are matters for intense speculation among Chinese, but the horoscope book is unequivocal in its advice for the new year.\n\"Better stick to routine and support conservative policies,\" it says.\nChina analysts say it is unlikely that party chief and state president Jiang Zemin -- born in the Year of the Tiger -- would risk anything other than a cautious and conservative approach in a year that could see confirmation of his supremacy as paramount leader Deng Xiaoping passes from the scene.\nFor those born in the Year of the Ox, the arrival of one's birth animal can herald inauspicious events, one Chinese analyst said.\n\"To have the year of your birth come around is not always good luck,\" the Chinese analyst said.\nThe 1949 genesis of the communist state was an ox year, and officials have said political stability is key to ensuring Beijing can accomplish its goals without a hitch this year.\n\"For the rebels, it may be worthwhile to point out that although the stoical Ox is soft-spoken, he carries a big stick, and this is his year,\" says Theodora Lau's handbook.\nAverage Chinese may be more concerned about where the beef is with the dawning of the Year of the Ox, the second year in the 12-animal Chinese lunar cycle.\nChina's booming economy and greater exposure to Western culinary habits has fuelled demand for beef and milk among urban hip Chinese who grew up on a diet of pork.\nBeef output has seen double-digit growth for several years and the number of dairy cows in Beijing has doubled to 60,000 from 10 years ago.\nBusiness is booming at 100 outlets of U.S. hamburger giant McDonald's nationwide, with many Chinese parents likely to take their children for a burger as part of new year festivities.\nOne traditional Chinese delicacy not likely to be found on the fast-food chain's menu is ox penis, a dish said to confer upon the diner the bull's reputed sexual stamina.\n", "Barrick Gold Corp said on Wednesday it was now the world's second largest gold producer, supplanting Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.\nBarrick's 1996 gold production was 3,148,801 ounces, surpassing Gold Fields' 3,125,631 ounces for fiscal 1996. Barrick expects 1997 production to top three million ounces again.\nThe Toronto-based company posted a 40 percent increase in its proven and probable reserves to 51 million ounces from 36.5 million ounces. Barrick also reported 25 million ounces of gold in the resource category -- gold not fully proven yet.\nBarrick has made no secret of its ambition to become the world's largest gold company, surpassing Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.\nTo clinch first place, Barrick is seeking control of the huge Busang deposit in Indonesia, said to be one of this century's most sensational gold discoveries.\nTwo new mines will also likely carry Barrick closer to its leadership goal. Drilling at Barrick's Pierina property in Peru expanded reserves there to 6.5 million ounces so far, Barrick said. The mine is expected to come into production in late 1999 at an annual rate of 500,000 ounces of gold.\nDrilling at Barrick's Pascua mine in Chile bumped reserves to 10 million ounces so far, with 6.7 million ounces identified in the reserve category. The mine is scheduled to start production of 400,000 ounces a year by the year 2000.\nBarrick has been negotiating with Calgary's Bre-X Minerals Ltd for months to control the Busang discovery, but Barrick's chances of success are up in the air.\n\"One of the messages they'll probably try to get across is that they are not desperate for it, they certainly don't need it, they have an awful lot already,\" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac with Deacon Capital in Toronto.\nBarrick also said today that its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings fell, due mainly to higher operating and exploration costs. Fourth-quarter profit declined to US$56 million or US$0.15 a share from year earlier US$78 million or US$0.22 a share.\nFull-year earnings declined to US$218 million or US$0.60 a share from US$292 million or US$0.82 a share in 1995.\nBarrick was down 0.40 to 35.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in afternoon trading on Wednesday and by 3/8 to 26-1/2 in New York.\n", "Canada's stubborn youth unemployment problem is the Achilles heel for the ruling Liberals as they campaign for re-election on June 2.\nAs Prime Minister Jean Chretien travels the country to boast about his party's economic record, a 16.6 percent youth unemployment rate threatens to be a serious embarrassment for the Liberals. The unemployment rate for the general population is 9.3 percent.\n\"This is the Liberal betrayal of an entire generation, their hopes, their dreams, and yes, their birth right as Canadians,\" the leader of the leftist New Democratic Party, Alexa McDonough, said on Tuesday.\n\"Somewhere along the line the Liberals decided that Canada could afford to lose a generation after all,\" McDonough told CBC Newsworld in Newfoundland.\nThe number of Canadian young people with jobs has dropped steeply in recent years, Canada's federal statistics agency said in a recent study.\nThe employment rate for Canadians aged 15 to 24 in 1996 was 51.1 percent, a drop of more than 11 percentage points since 1989, Statistics Canada said.\nThe most recent statistics show the employment rate for youth was 50.5 percent in March. The difference between the 50.5 percent employment rate and the 16.6 unemployment rate is made up of young people in school or who have given up finding a job.\n\"The labor market has become a more precarious place for young people in the 1990s,\" StatsCan said in its spring 1997 youth unemployment report.\nBut none of the parties have a concrete plan to deal with youth unemployment, despite their rampant rhetoric, said Brad Lavigne, chairman of the 400,000-member Cahadian Federation of Students.\n\"There hasn't been an adequate level of discussion yet,\" he said in a phone interview in Ottawa. \"The (age group) is not seen as important.

They hope to wrap up negotiations in December.\n\"That should be an example to the rest of the world and a platform on which to build,\" Brittan said.\nBut he and the other leaders pointed out the need for countries in Asia and Latin America to put together improved offers to the World Trade Organisation. Last year the United States pulled out of talks on financial services because of its disappointment in the offers from other countries.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, in a letter last week to a number of his counterparts, said a successful financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice.\nIt must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial services providers, he said.\nThe four trading chiefs also called for bringing China and Russia into the World Trade Organisation quickly.\nThe Quad members said they were united in their belief that China, in particular, should be brought into the global trading forum as long as Beijing committed itself to the global trading system and open market access.\n\"We are not going to push on the accelerator for political reasons, and we are not going to put on the brakes for political reasons,\" Brittan said.\nOfficials said the Quad members would like new members, especially China, to sign on to a recent pact to eliminate tariffs on various information technologies by 2000.\nThe forum provided an opportunity for the four countries to discuss bilateral trade issues with each other.\nThe European Union expressed concern about the implementation of a 1992 agreement with the United States limiting subsidies to aircraft industries.\n\"We do not accept that proposition at all, at the same time the United States has some concerns about European practices,\" U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters after a morning meeting with Brittan.\nBarshefsky said U.S. and EU officials would continue discussions on the issue in June, but that the United States would not agree to any emergency consultations.\nBarshefsky also had a strong word with Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton over Canada's new copyright law which taxes blank cassettes and distributes the royalties to performers. U.S. performers, however, will not receive any money since the United States has not signed an international copyright agreement.\n\"We think there is a national treatment problem here,\" Barshefsky said, referring to one country's preferential treatment for its citizens.

That, in turn, would make the Havas media group the biggest shareholder in Canal Plus.\nThe companies added in a joint statement that they would not comment further pending board meetings scheduled for February 6.\nThe prospect of a major transformation of the French media landscape gained weight when a corporate source confirmed that Alcatel Alsthom was in talks about a possible sale of part of its 21.2 percent stake in Havas to Generale des Eaux.\nGenerale des Eaux, already a powerful force in the water and telecommmunications industry, owns almost 20 percent of Canal Plus. The satellite broadcaster is itself merging with fellow-pay-TV group Nethold to create Europe's largest subscription television company.\nAccording to French newspapers, Generale des Eaux would transfer its Canal Plus stake into Havas, almost doubling Havas's current 21.6 percent stake in the broadcaster. Havas would then increase its own capital to allow Generale des Eaux a bigger stake.\nOther major shareholders in Canal Plus are the bank Societe Generale , with 4.5 percent, and the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations with 6.9 percent.\nGenerale des Eaux would also become indirectly the biggest shareholder in the merged Canal Plus company. Havas would establish its direct dominance within Canal Plus, well ahead of Nethold's owners, Richemont and MIH, which have 15 and 4.9 percent repectively.\nAlcatel has owned 21.2 percent of Havas since selling its media business to Havas in 1995 in return for shares in Havas, which it was obliged to hold on to for at least two years.\nThe initial market reaction was broadly positive. Havas shares soared and those of Generale jumped too. \"It's a good deal for all parties involved,\" one share dealer said.\nAlcatel stands to make a capital gain on the sale, as well as receiving cash, because the Havas share price has increased a lot over the past year, in line with a French stock market which is at record highs.\nAlcatel needs money to finance its planned acquisition, if the state permits it, of the government's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF .\nThe government is due to announce its Thomson-CSF sale plans shortly, after scrapping its original privatisation plan in December.\nNewspapers have for months speculated about the Havas share structure, although Generale des Eaux has in the past denied plans to raise its stake.\nOn the share market, Havas shares opened up eight percent but then gave in some of the gains to trade 5.3 percent up at 427 francs.\nGenerale des Eaux was 0.7 percent up at 713, but Canal Plus was 0.93 percent lower at 1,171 and Alcatel slipped 0.55 percent to 545 francs.\n", "Silicon Graphics Inc. said it will launch a new line of computer workstations Monday as the company moves to fend off the threat of increasingly high-powered personal computers.\nThe new line of Octane workstations fills out the broadest revamp ever of Silicon Graphics' product line. It includes a powerful new design aimed at bolstering its No. 3 position in the market for workstations running the Unix operating system.\nThe Mountain View, Calif.-based company discussed its new products in interviews ahead of Monday's formal release.\nSilicon Graphics will also shave the prices of its Indigo2 Impact 10000 workstations by up to 22 percent as it aims to position the line between its entry-level O2 machines, introduced in October, and the new Octane models.\nThe powerful machines are typically used by engineers in intensive number-crunching tasks ranging from oil exploration and molecular modeling to flight simulation, computer-aided design and video and television.\nThe new Octanes share many of their components with the company's new supercomputing design unveiled in October and feature technology that greatly increases the speed with which data moves between its components.\n\"What SGI has done is eliminate most of the chokepoints, and you get the full effects of most of the microprocessor\" that is the heart of the computer, said David Weisberg, publisher of the newsletter Engineering Automation Report in Englewood, Colo.\nWeisberg and industry analysts said such performance was important to Silicon Graphics' effort to fend off the threat to its traditional high-end graphics markets by increasingly powerful PCs built with Intel Corp. microprocessors running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system. Shipments of the computers based on what analysts have dubbed the \"Wintel\" PC architecture surpassed traditional workstations for the first time in 1996, according to preliminary data from International Data Corp.\nThe market research firm said Wintel-based systems grew 38 percent worldwide to 831,000 units. With revenues rising 16 percent to $3.7 billion while sales of traditional Unix workstations declined, International Data said it expects Windows NT-based systems to continue gaining share in 1997.\nWeisberg said he was concerned that Silicon Graphics, along with Sun Microsystems Inc., has chosen to shun Windows NT and adapt a Unix-only approach despite the fact many newer software developers favor Windows NT.\n\"Silicon Graphics is, in effect, eliminating some of the very good software vendors,\" he said. \"If they don't make some type of a move to support Windows NT by the end of the year, 1998 could be a very difficult year for Silicon Graphics.\"\nDrew Henry, product line manager of Silicon Graphics' power desktop line, said that with the design used in its O2, Indigo2 and Octane systems, Silicon Graphics can \"sell levels of performance that are well above levels of performance that you're going to get out of a Wintel system.\"\nAbout half of the new Octanes, which Silicon Graphics plans to start shipping by the beginning of March, are expected to be sold through third parties, he said.\nInternational Data analyst Karen Seymour said the Octane's new design, or architecture, would give it \"headroom\" for future high-end performance and help it gain market share. But she said it was not likely to challenge the position of first-place Sun Microsystems and No. 2 Hewlett-Packard Co..\n\"I think the most critical aspect of this announcement is going to be SGI's ability to execute,\" she said.\nSilicon Graphics last week said delays in stepping up production of new computer models hurt financial performance in its December quarter despite strong demand for new products which pushed its orders to record levels.\nPricing for the Octane systems starts at $24,995, the company said.\nThe new prices for Indigo2 machines, which take effect Feb. 1 and include up to a 33 percent reduction in memory and storage upgrade prices, reduce the price of its lower-end Indigo2 Solid Impact to $19,995 from $24.995.\n", "Franco-Italian semiconductor group SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV on Wednesday reported a 19 percent rise in 1996 earnings to $625.5 million but warned about the first quarter of 1997 after a weak end to last year.\nThe profit warning and lower fourth quarter results took the market by surprise and the share closed nearly 12 percent lower at 379.40 francs in Paris in a turnover of 542 million francs ($98 million).\nThe French blue-chip index closed 1.35 percent higher.\n\"There is an awful lot of profit-taking. Now that it is falling 12 percent people are seeing a disaster, but it has been rising a lot in January,\" said a dealer.\nSGS-Thomson has been steadily climbing from 154.50 francs in July to 433 francs on January 20, with the rise accelerated earlier this month when Intel Corp reported a big rise in quartely profits.\nAt SGS-Thomson, the fourth quarter earnings were down by 15.5 percent to $142 million.\nPresident and chief executive Pasquale Pistorio said he was pleased with the 1996 performance. He was cautious about the first quarter of 1997 although he said the company would still outperform the industry average.\n\"With lead times shrinking throughout the industry, we are entering the first quarter of 1997 with less order visibility than we have historically enjoyed,\" he said.\n\"From what we know today, we expect 1997 first quarter revenues to be close to third quarter 1996 levels. We also anticipate that overall pricing pressures will continue, and therefore, in spite of productivity improvements, gross margins could be slightly below fourth quarter 1996 levels.\"\nIn the third quarter, net revenues were $988.4 million.\n\"While first quarter conditions continue to be uncertain, we believe that subsequent quarters of 1997 will show progressive improvement compared to the 1997 first quarter as the company continues to emphasise differentiated products and high growth applications,\" Pistorio added.\n\"Recent contracts with key customers and new design wins in such high growth areas as hard disk drives, set-top boxes and digital cellular phones give us confidence that SGS-Thomson will continue to outperform the industry average in 1997.\"\nCompany chief economist Jean-Phillipe Dauvin said the world semiconductor market had fallen by eight percent in 1996 which made it the third worst year on record for the industry.\nThe fall was to a large extent due to price pressures, with prices of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips plunging by 80 to 90 percent, causing losses at many chipmakers.\nSGS-Thomson does not make DRAMs, however, but dedicated chips which shielded it somewhat from the price erosion. Its market rose by five percent.\nDauvin said that market research bureaux WSTS, Dataquest and VLSI Research were predicting a 1997 market increase ranging from respectively 7.4 percent to 14.9 percent.\n\"In 1997 there will probably be a slight recovery but we will not see a big upturn until 1998. It is possible that we have to postpone the start of the recovery from June-July to the second half of 1997,\" Dauvin added.\nIn 1996, according to Dataquest estimates, SGS-Thomson moved to the ninth place in the world ranking from 14 in 1995, being the sole chip maker with Intel to show significant sales growth.\nDauvin said he maintained his forecast that the chip market would be worth $300 billion in 2000, against $133 billion now.

They were probably reeling and felt the need to do something,\" Snow said in a telephone interview.\nHe was referring to setbacks last week in which a federal judge and a regulatory agency denied Norfolk Southern's attempt to block the Conrail-CSX transaction.\nNorfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, whose $10.3 billion bid for Conrail has been rejected, said late Monday it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail stock if the Philadelphia-based railroad's shareholders defeated a key measure that would allow the proposed Conrail-CSX transaction to proceed.\nWall Street sources had speculated the new development in the three-month takeover battle could prompt Conrail to delay the shareholder meeting.\nConrail will be asking shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law that would essentially require Richmond, Va.-based CSX to pay for Conrail in cash. The proposed Conrail-CSX transaction is a mixture of cash and stock.\nNorfolk Southern has offered to buy Conrail for cash.\nSnow said he was \"reasonably confident, but guarded\" Conrail shareholders would approve the measure Friday.\nVotes are expected to be tallied by early next week.\nWall Street analysts said Norfolk Southern might win some new allies with its plans, but said its efforts to derail the merger may not succeed.\n\"It might have some influence on (the shareholders), but it looks to me like it may be too late. This has been a tough battle for Norfolk Southern,\" said Thom Brown, managing director of investment firm Rutherford, Brown and Catherwood Inc., adding that Norfolk Southern was \"trying to win over any uncommitted shareholder they can find.\"\nIf shareholders defeat the measure, Conrail has the right to call another meeting.\n\"If we lose it, I think it's going to be 'shame on us' for not having communicated fully the benefits of this merger,\" Snow said. \"What I propose doing, if we lost it ... would be to take our time, and patiently go around and talk to the shareholders -- that may take three months, that may take six months -- until they really understood the merger.\"\nSnow said he spoke earlier Tuesday to Conrail Chairman David LeVan.\n\"They're firmly committed to us. We're firmly committed to them,\" Snow said. \"We certainly hope we win the vote. If we don't win the vote, we're still committed to each other.

Many construction products will also be revamped.  \nOne major portion of that product overhaul, a new tractor series, will enter production this spring, Rosso said.\nThe MX Series tractors, which run from 85 to 115 horsepower, are in the midsize area of the tractor market, which represent about 30 percent of tractor sales worldwide for Case, Rosso said.\nOrders in the United States and Europe have already exceeded company plans, Rosso said, although he would not disclose what those plans were.\n\"We have significant orders on both sides of the ocean already,\" he said.  \nThe tractor, which was recently unveiled, will be produced in Racine and the United Kingdom.\nThe switch from the German production site of Case's mid-sized tractors is expected to lower costs both from a labor and logistics stand point, Case said. The Racine and UK plants are also more efficient than the German plant. The new design utilizes more common components for models in different parts of the world, also bringing down costs, Case said.\nTypically, the U.S. market has larger farms and looks for more horsepower, with wider implements. European farmers are looking for more advanced features on lower horsepower tractors, Rosso said.  \n\"The new design is much better matched to the needs and requirements of the customer base that it is targeted to,\" said J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. The pricing of the tractor will also be equivalent to products offered by competitor Deere &amp; Co, Brumley said.\nThe switch to the MX series tractors is expected to depress earnings in the first quarter, before boosting earnings later in the year, Case and analysts have said.\nAt the same time, Case is also introducing a premium tractor called the QuadTrak, which has also been well received.  \n\"There's more demand than we can supply this year,\" Rosso said of the QuadTrak, which is designed with four tracks to have better terrain handling and less soil compaction.\nIn the early phases of the QuadTrak introduction, Case will lease about half of those tractors in order to get more customer feedback, Rosso said.\nAlso this year, Case plans to introduce a new skid steer loader, a piece of construction equipment that can utilize many different attachments -- sort of the construction equivalent of a Swiss Army knife. The loader will be at the higher-margin heavy lift end of the product line, Rosso said.\n\"It gets us in a part of the market which we are not present,\" Rosso said.\nAdding a new product to its skid steer line could help Case to face new competition in the market, Brumley said.\n\"They're number two in market share and that skid steer market is going to get real crowded,\" with offerings from other manufacturers, Brumley said.\n((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787))\n", "America Online Inc., beset with network overload problems and angry subcribers, said Thursday it will spend even more than planned to shore up its network, amid another soaring subscriber growth report.\nThe Dulles, Va.-based company has experienced growing pains in the United States in the form of service outages -- including a partial outage of nearly four hours Wednesday -- since it switched its members to unlimited usage for $19.95 a month in December.\nThe largest online services company in the world said it will now spend $350 million to upgrade its network, instead of $250 million as previously planned, to add new modems and build an 180,000 square foot data centre. It also will add new customer service representatives and halt its nationwide television advertising campaign for the time being.\nAOL said the current usage of its network was exceeding its most aggressive forecasts, much of it due to the unlimited pricing plan.

And we're working day and night to fix them,\" he wrote.\nCase also made an unusual plea to AOL members, many of whom are clogging up the system by staying on all day or for long periods of time, to cut back on their usage.\n\"There is something you can do to help and that is to moderate your own use of AOL a bit, during our peak evening periods,\" Case said. \"Use AOL as much as you want during the day, but try to show some restraint at night during the next few months when we're in this transitional mode.\"\nPeter Krasilovsky, an analyst with Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md., said he thought the network problems would be solved in about three months.\n\"The letter was very contrite, and as usual Steve's communications are very good, it was just overdue,\" Krasilovsky said. \"It's a difficult economics issue, you don't want to overbuild and be stuck with a bunch of extra modems and extra capacity.\"\nBut at the rate AOL is growing, it may need all the 150,000 modems it is adding.\nAOL said that its worldwide subscriber growth, fuelled by the unlimited plan, boomed to more than 8 million members, with 500,000 new members in December alone, a record. AOL added 1.2 million members in the quarter ended December.\nAOL also said its local services launched in Britain, Canada, Germany and France had grown to more than half a million, since they were launched in the past 14 months.\nWall Street was impressed by the faster-than-expected growth in U.S. membership, fuelling a $3.375 jump in AOL's stock to $41.50, most of it at the end of the day.\nAnalysts said the good news was a much-needed boost for AOL, which was hit this week by three class-action lawsuits, by angry members frustrated by their inability to get online.\nTheir allegations range from breach of contract for failure to provide services to false advertising. Attorneys general in several states confirmed they were in talks with AOL to seek some remedy to the growing consumer complaints.\nTo add to AOL's problems, late Wednesday afternoon, it had to shut down half its system when it noticed around 3 p.m. EST that more people could not sign on. The system ran at 50 percent capacity until 7:30 p.m. EST and full capacity was not reached until 8 p.m.\nThe company said it will sharply reduce the number of mailings of free trial disks, especially to cities where its customers were experiencing the most busy signals.\nAOL said that between now and June it planned to increase by 75 percent the current total of 200,000-plus modems in its AOLNet system.

Alcon is one of the world's biggest eyecare companies, making contact lenses and solutions as well as prescription drugs.\n\"Ophthalmology is an area of growing importance,\" Padfield said, which was likely to benefit from ageing populations in the developed world and increasing expenditure in developing countries. He said it was also a \"niche area\" with very few competitors.\nPadfield said the programme with Alcon would focus on Chiroscience's work in MMP inhibitors, PNP inhibitors and PDE IV inhibitors.\nChiroscience is working on drugs for arthritis and cancer using MMP inhibitors, but Padfield said these may also prove useful in areas like corneal ulceration and recovery from eye surgery because of the role they played in healing wounds.\nPadfield told Reuters that the group's lower profile work on inhibiting another class of enzyme, PNPs, could also receive a boost, with potential in corneal transplantation. Padfield said initial results suggested that PNP inhibitors could be more effective in helping prevent rejection of transplants than the current lead drug, cyclosporine, marketed by Novartis AG as Sandimmum.\nA third major part of Chiroscience's novel drug programme involving the PDE IV enzyme, which is implicated in major inflammatory diseases like asthma and arthritis, could also be extended to inflammatory diseases of the eye.\nPadfield said the agreement did not extend to the genetic research being conducted by Darwin Molecular Corp, the Seattle-based biotech company which Chiroscience bought in November 1996. But he noted work done by Alcon and the University of Iowa on isolating a gene linked to glaucoma, and said the two companies will \"be able to talk about what we have in Seattle.\"\nPadfield said access to Alcon's rapid-screening skills for new drugs would \"offset some of the need to invest\" in new technology. Chiroscience will have rights to all non-ophthalmic discoveries made through the alliance.\nPadfield declined to disclose financial details of the arrangement, but said \"most of the money\" would come from product royalties and milestone payments. \"There is a bit of cash up front,\" he added.\nShares in Chiroscience were up 7 pence at 371 in early afternoon trading.\n--London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n", "Hewlett-Packard Co. jumped solidly into the Microsoft Windows NT camp on Wednesday, saying it would \"aggressively integrate\" the operating system into its computers and spend tens of millions of dollars on joint strategies.\nHP Chairman and CEO Lewis Platt, appearing at a news conference with Microsoft Corp Chairman and CEO Bill Gates, said the companies would work together on a broad range of products and services aimed at reducing computing costs.  \nAt one time Hewlett-Packard dismissed Windows NT, designed for the servers that run computer networks. Platt said customer demand was behind the decision to embrace it.\n\"It's all built around input from our customers,\" he said in a news conference at HP's corporate headquarters in Palo Alto.\nSupport for Windows NT -- only one aspect of the collaboration announced by the companies -- corresponds to HP's plan to develop a new processor with Intel Corp capable of running both NT and Unix software.  \nHP's warming to Microsoft could cause some discomfort to the company's partners, especially Netscape Communications Corp, Microsoft's Internet arch-rival. HP forged an alliance last May with Netscape to help companies build Internet-based internal networks on Unix and NT systems, analysts said.\n\"Our strategic direction is to provide choices and interoperability between choices,\" said one HP executive, called on by Platt and other HP executives to answer a question on whether HP will continue to support Novell Inc.'s directory services, as announced last week.  \nHP executives have stressed that the company wants to stay clear of the battles raging between Microsoft and Silicon Valley companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc.\nBut David Tremblay, an analyst at Computer Intelligence/ Infocorp, said the next year may bring confusion for HP's customers if, for example, its neutrality prevents HP from making firm recommendations on software suppliers.\nThe deal also strikes a blow for HP rival Digital Equipment Corp, which has worked with Microsoft on Windows NT for five years. Digital's speedy Alpha chip is the only 64-bit microprocessor that currently runs NT.  \n\"The strength of HP is really quite impressive,\" Gates said in response to a question about how the deal may affect Microsoft's alliance with Digital. \"We've got a lot of breadth here.\"\nThe demand for services and support for NT now exceeds what has been available on the market before the deal with HP, which has a wide array of reseller partners, Gates said.\n\"Digital's jumping up and down about NT, but they're not exactly blowing the doors off of it,\" one analyst said.  \nThe growth of Windows NT is building steam, according to Gates, who showed a slide in which sales of Windows NT Server licenses were approaching 250,000 in the fourth quarter of 1996, up from around 150,000 in the first quarter last year. \"HP is pragmatic, if nothing else,\" said Scott Miller, an analyst at Dataquest. But he cautioned that HP faced a challenge as it drew more technologgy from partners such as Intel and Microsoft, making it more difficult for the company to \"own the customer\" as closely as in the past.\n((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau +415 846 5400))\n", "Pulling back from the battered car rental business, Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it agreed to sell its interests in Budget Rent a Car Corp. to a Florida firm in a deal valued at about $350 million.\nTeam Rental Group Inc., the Daytona Beach-based buyer, already owns and operates 13 Budget franchises with 155 locations. It also leases commuter vans in 22 states and sells used vehicles.\n\"In light of investor interest in the entire rental car industry, we concluded that it is now in the best interests of Budget and Ford if Team Rental, Budget's largest franchisee, were to acquire Budget. It's a good fit,\" Ford Vice Chairman Ed Hagenlocker said in a statement.\nAlthough the sale of Ford's preferred stock in Budget is not expected to close until March, the automaker said it will book an unspecified gain on the deal in its fourth quarter 1996 earnings.\nThe gain will partially reverse a $437 million after-tax write-off Ford took on its investment and on loans to Budget in the second quarter.\nThe deal also will add cash to Ford's coffers, bringing it closer to a future stock repurchase program.\nFord spokesman Christian Vinyard said top Ford executives told analysts Friday that the company will consider such repurchases after it cuts automotive costs by $1 billion and boosts cash reserves above their current level of $7 billion.\n\"We said it's on the menu, but way down the line,\" Vinyard said of a stock buyback program. \"Don't be looking for it in the March or April timeframe.\"\nTuesday's deal marked a major shift by Ford to reduce its rental car holdings and reverses a plan announced by the automaker last year to acquire full ownership of Budget.\nFord also has said it may sell a partial stake in its Hertz Corp. subsidiary, among other strategic options it examining.\nArchrival General Motors Corp.  has already divested its holdings in National Car Rental System Inc. and Avis Inc., while Chrysler Corp.'s Dollar and Thrifty units remain on the sale block.\nAnalysts said a new breed of bottom line-oriented investors was now taking a dominant role in car rental industry.\n\"That industry has gotten a little fat,\" said George Magliano, an automotive consultant with WEFA Group in New York. \"They sit with a lot of cars that go unrented. And when that happens, the bottom line is destroyed,\" said George\nLisle, Ill.-based Budget, together with its independent licensees, ranks as the world's fourth-largest rental car business, Ford said.\nFord does not own Budget outright, but controls it through a stock purchase option.\n\"We have the right to direct the sale of the common shares and that's what we have done,\" Vinyard said.\nA Team Rental spokesman said the company will pay $275 million in cash and issue non-voting preferred securities convertible into 4.5 million shares of Team common stock with a minimum value at closing of $75 million.\nThe board of Team Rental already has approved the deal, spokesman Steve Polito said.\nFord said it would continue to be a major supplier of cars and trucks to Budget's fleet. The transaction also includes a new vehicle supply arrangement between Ford and Budget.\nAutomakers began acquiring rental car companies in the mid-1980s with the idea that they could absorb unsold auto inventory into their fleets and keep Detroit's factories running.\nThat strategy worked for a few years, but then backfired when sales of barely used rental vehicles began eating into new car sales.\nThe Budget deal is the second major car rental sale in just over a week. On Jan. 6, investor H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries Inc. bought National from a private investor group for $600 million. Republic bought Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc. late last year.\nFord's stock closed up 50 cents at $33.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "Australian banking and insurance group Colonial Ltd hopes to make a strong share-market debut on Monday after major investors rushed its A$690 million (US$535 million) float.\nOn the eve of its listing on the Australian and New Zealand exchanges, Colonial announced it had priced the share offer at A$3.10 per share for institutional investors, well above the shares' net asset backing of A$2.48 each.\nColonial had given an \"indicative range\" of between A$2.50 and A$2.90 as a guide to institutions, but on Sunday it said the limited number of shares on offer drew bids well above that.\nInstitutional bids closed on Friday.\nOf the total 235 million shares on offer, institutions could bid for only two-thirds, ensuring they paid a handsome premium to the price paid by retail investors in the first stage of the offer.\nColonial sold shares to members of the public for a fixed price of A$2.60 each this month. Each share, for both retail and institutional shareholders, comes with an option to buy more.\n\"We are delighted...,\" Colonial managing director Peter Smedley told a news conference in Melbourne.\n\"One would hope for a premium over the institutional price (on listing),\" he added.\nColonial becomes only the second life office to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, after one of its bigger rivals, National Mutual Holdings Ltd, listed last October.\nAustralia's biggest, the Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP), will soon follow. It plans to shed its old mutual structure and list in Australia and New Zealand next year.\nColonial has total assets of A$29.7 billion and is the only local life office with a bank, Sydney-based Colonial State Bank.\nIt will list with a register of over 500,000 shareholders, including its former Asian insurance partner, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd, which has secured a major stake.\nColonial will use some of the proceeds of the float to fund its recent decision to buy out Jardine's half interest in their Asian business for US$163 million.\nColonial has, like National Mutual, focused on Asia to grow its business.\nIt has applied for a licence to sell life insurance in China and has operations across Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. Its traditional offshore markets are Britain, New Zealand and Fiji.\nColonial's Smedley indicated on Sunday the company had tried to weed out the stags from the long-term investors in the float.\nHe said Colonial had tried to identify investors \"perceived to be long term\" when allocating shares to institutions.\n", "China's new central depository has ambitious goals to clean up the chaotic state debt market and implement risk controls to prevent losses from a chain of debts, and analysts said it may have the clout to do just that.\nFormally registered last month, the China Government Securities Depository Trust and Clearing Co was created by the central bank, the People's Bank of China, and the Ministry of Finance and six other shareholders with capital of 180 million yuan ($21.6 million).\n\"Our primary goal is to solve the problem of risk on the state debt market,\" said Wang Ping, executive vice-president of the clearing house. \"We want to bring risk down to its lowest possible level.\"\nOther goals include providing a centralised clearing system and uniting nationwide back office operations, Wang told Reuters in an interview.\nAnother major aim was to prevent borrowers wanting funds amid a national credit squeeze turning to loopholes on China's fledgling repo markets, resulting in huge levels of debt estimated at 50-60 billion yuan ($6.0-7.0 million).\nThe central bank planned to issue debt to clear up the outstanding chain of debt that had resulted from institutions engaging in the banned practice of turning to the repo market while holding bills worth as little as three percent of the value of funds raised, Wang said.\nThe clearing centre has been quietly carving out a niche for its operations aimed at regulating the chaotic and disparate system since it won a battle with Shanghai's Foreign Exchange Trading System to handle China's repo market.\nWang said the Beijing-based securities depository hoped to have united all bond and repo back office operations within 1997, and had ambitious goals for its future.\n\"We want to promote the merging of financial policy and monetary policy,\" Wang said.\n\"With the support of the People's Bank and the Ministry of Finance, we are moving toward international market practices and hope to set up a foundation for the opening to foreigners of China's debt market,\" he said.\nHowever, he said that this target remained several years in the future and would depend on China's ability to make its yuan currency convertible on the capital account. Officials have said they would like full convertibility by the year 2000.\nThe securities depository also appeared poised to become the main channel through which the central bank would conduct its open market operations.\nIn 1996, the first year the central bank conducted open market operations, turnover was more than 4.0 billion yuan, Wang said. \"The amount this year will be significantly larger.\n\"The People's Bank will put into effect a double-track system of direct and indirect control,\" he said. \"On one hand it will control the scale of loans while on the other it will greatly expand open market operations and discounting.\"\nThe central bank aimed to end direct controls by 1998, he said. It would also issue short-term debt of one-year and below maturity to trade with state banks this year, he said.\nOfficials declined to reveal the planned size of central bank open market operations, but some sources said turnover could soar as high as 200 billion this year.\nWang acknowledged that the new securities depository had run into some opposition, citing unidentified interest groups in some regions as well as market players who did not fully understand the need for a regulated system.\nThe bulk of China's state debt is traded through the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges, as well as through dozens of smaller centres scattered across China.\n\"So we need administrative measures to help us to do our work,\" he said.\n", "Britain's final departure next year from its colony of Hong Kong will be sealed with a handshake, a British minister said on Tuesday, confirming the two countries would share one final last symbolic embrace.\nBeijing's top Hong Kong policymaker had indicated he was willing to join the British territory's last imperial governor at a ceremony to mark its return to China, said Jeremy Hanley, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\nChinese official Lu Ping's willingness to join Britain's Governor Chris Patten in the limelight appeared to signal new willingness to set aside differences in the run-up to the colony's return to Beijing rule on July 1, 1997.\n\"I had confirmation from Lu Ping this morning that he is looking forward to shaking the governor's hand at the handover ceremony,\" Hanley told a news conference in Beijing.\nLondon and Beijing have long bickered over the arrangements for Hong Kong's mid-1997 transition to Chinese rule after more than 150 years, with disagreement over the handover ceremony once so entrenched that the prospects for a joint event seemed doubtful.\nBeijing, infuriated by Patten's drive to expand democracy in the colony ahead of its return, has tried to limit Britain's role, while London is keen to leave in imperial style.\nBritain in March signaled that a joint ceremony was in doubt, with diplomatic sources reporting that the main hurdle in talks was China's insistence that Patten should not attend.\nHong Kong government radio reported late last month that Chinese and British negotiators could reach an outline agreement on the ceremony by the end of September, just nine months before the end of London's rule.\nA willingness to share the podium with the governor could reflect a muting of Chinese anger at Patten, who has long been the butt of scathing editorials in the Beijing media.\nLu Ping has frequently shown reluctance to meet Patten during visits to the colony, although he has often had conferences with other British and Hong Kong officials.\nHanley said differences remained to be settled on handover arrangements, but added progress had been made.\n\"We've had very useful discussions,\" he said.\n\"On the handover ceremony, the Chinese government agree that it should be grand, solemn and dignified, and fitting to the historical importance of the event,\" Hanley said.\nBritain and China say relations have warmed in recent months, boosted by high-level exchanges and a May trade visit to Beijing by British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine.\nDifferences remained over China's determination to scrap Hong Kong's elected legislature, known as Legco, Hanley said.\n\"It is unnecessary for Legco, which has been duly elected, to be replaced before the end of its term in 1999,\" he said.\nWhile Hanley called for urgency to resolve outstanding disagreements before the 1997 handover, China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Lu Ping as saying \"minor differences\" did not necessarily have to be ironed out before the day arrived.\n\"We will try our best to solve minor differences before the first of July, 1997. If some of the differences cannot be solved by that day, it doesn't matter,\" Lu said. \"They can be resolved gradually by the Hong Kong people themselves.\"\n", "Cable and Wireless Plc, Britain's second biggest telecommunications company, reported record annual results on Wednesday but said it was biding its time before choosing any global partners.\nC&amp;W, which confirmed it was still in talks with telecoms alliances such as Global One, said pre-tax profits after exceptional items jumped 12 percent to 1.42 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in the year ended March 31.\nBut stripping out one-off items, profits were only two to four percent higher than last year, analysts said.\nThe company, which raised its total dividend 11 percent to 11.1 pence for the year to March 31, said greater demand in its businesses around the world and a management focus on improving productivity had boosted performance.\nGroup turnover, including C&amp;W's share of associated undertakings, rose 13 percent to just over 7.0 billion pounds. Although underlying profits were in line with expectations, the shares fell 20p to 492.5p.\nAnalysts were split on why the shares were being marked down. Some cited profit taking and others blamed concerns over C&amp;W's cable venture, uncertainty over its key Hong Kong business and restlessness that the company appeared to be ignoring key European and U.S. markets in its drive for expansion -- at least in the short term.\nAndrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers, remains unperturbed. \"The results were pretty good across the board. There are a lot of one-offs which have to be taken out but at an underlying level, they were at the top half of the range of expectations,\" he said.\nC&amp;W's chief executive Richard Brown promised that the company was just beginning to build long-term growth.\n\"We are seizing opportunities to expand our revenues in fresh, innovative ways,\" said chief executive Richard Brown in the results statement.\nThe company last month merged its British telephone subsidiary Mercury with three cable television companies to create the country's biggest cable group called Cable and Wireless Communications, which some analysts say will boost the bottom line within a couple of years.\nFinance director Robert Lerwill told Reuters that the group continued to talk with suitors such as the Global One alliance of Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint Corp.\nBut he noted: \"There's nothing specific on any conversations with Global One worth commenting on.\n\"People have been approaching us and are interested in us, which demonstrates our global reach and the appeal we have for many of these global alliances.\"\nGlobal One needs access to the British market as well as C&amp;W's key Asian business interests, which boast a nearly 60 percent stake in lucrative Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd .\nHongkong Telecom contributed just over one billion pounds to annual operating profits and 2.67 billion pounds to group turnover.\nA partnership with Global One would also allow C&amp;W to tap the key European telecoms markets, such as France and Germany, which are heading for liberalisation next year.\n\"If we did in some way get associated with another alliance, then (continental) Europe is the place where there is more to go for,\" Lerwill said.\nC&amp;W, which says it will use Cable and Wireless Communications as its springboard for European expansion, has limited access to that continent since pulling out of its German alliance with VEBA AG in February.\nOne question mark which hangs over C&amp;W is its holding in Hongkong Telecom. With only weeks to go before the British colony reverts to Chinese control, speculation has been sparked that China may pressure C&amp;W into reducing its majority stake.\nBut C&amp;W insists there is no requirement for it do so. Instead, it welcomed more direct Chinese involvement in Hongkong Telecom last week, seeing it as a sign that the Chinese are likely to use the company as their principal telecoms partner in Hong Kong.\nChina Everbright, which reports to China's State Council (cabinet), bought a 7.7 percent stake in the Hong Kong company from CITIC Pacific, which is seen by analysts to be more independent.\nSome analysts expect further Chinese investment in Hongkong Telecom, combined with new growth opportunities for the Hong Kong firm on the Chinese mainland.\nBut Adrian Goodall, telecoms analyst at SBC Warburg, said: \"The potential for growth in China is indisputable, although the ability to make attractive returns from investment in that growth may be a tough proposition.\"\n", "The Czech Republic took both reverse singles matches from India on Sunday clinching a berth in the second round of the Davis Cup, but lost its number one player, Petr Korda in the process.\nJiri Novak gave the Czechs a 3-2 victory with a straight set 6-1 6-4 6-3 victory over Mahesh Bhupathi after Korda, who announced he was retiring from Davis Cup play, had brought his team level with a 5-7 6-3 6-4 6-1 win over Leander Paes.\nNovak barely broke a sweat against Bhupathi, who is ranked more than 400 places lower, needing just 90 minutes to dispatch the Indian number two.\nJumping out to a quick start, Novak, ranked 67th in the world, took the first set 6-1 and went up 5-0 in the second before losing his rythmn, and four consecutive games. But he regrouped to hold serve in the tenth game for the set.\nHe then broke Bhupathi twice in the third set to clinch the tie. \"This is one of the biggest matches I have won in my life,\" said an elated Novak following the match.\nKorda, ranked 33rd in the world, also had little trouble in his matchup with Paes, overpowering the Indian at the net and unleashing powerful groundstrokes from the baseline.\nHe squandered five break points in the first set, while Paes, ranked 105th in the world, took advantage of the only one he had to take the first set in 53 minutes.\nBut Korda showed no signs of a cold that has plagued him throughout the week, quickly getting back on track to take the next three sets.\n\"Overall though, I am still really happy both myself and the team performed,\" said Olympic bronze medalist Paes.\nAfter the win, Korda said he would no longer play for the Czechs in the Davis Cup, complaining of the demands it put on a player.\n\"There was a lot of pressure on me for this match, but I showed the kind of player I am,\" he said.\n\"I have thought about retiring (from Davis Cup) for a while and it's time to leave. It is a very tiring, draining experience and I think you should leave at the top. Now is the right time.\"\nKorda, who was once ranked as high as fifth in the world, has been the anchor of the Czech team since his debut in 1988, compiling a 30-12 overall record, including three wins against India this weekend.\nThe loss of Korda is the second setback for last year's semifinalists, after Czech number two Daniel Vacek bowed out of action to concentrate more on his performance on the ATP tour.\n", "Australia's A$6 billion (US$4.68 billion) car industry could grind to a halt from late next week due to a crippling strike at a key supplier, industry sources said on Tuesday.\nThe four major manufacturers -- Ford, Toyota, General Motors Holden and Mitsubishi Motors -- have warned local production lines will be shut down if the strike drags on much longer.\nThe strike, in its fourth week, has crippled Melbourne's Martin Bright Steel factory, which holds a key position in the local car-parts industry supplying the car-makers.\n\"Obviously if supply of anything dried up, we would not be able to keep producing. We are keeping a watching brief,\" said Ford Australia's public affairs general manager, Wendy Perkins.\n\"We are still going and expect to be until at least Friday week (May 16),\" she told Reuters.\nThe steel plant, owned by industrial group Email Ltd, is the supplier to TRW Steering and Suspension Australia Ltd, which is a monopoly supplier of power steering units to car-makers.\nTRW Steering and Suspension managing director Michael Laufer declined to comment on Tuesday, but an industry source said the firm could only keep going for another two weeks.\nTRW has supplied car makers for the past three weeks by finding substitute parts for the power steering units, but this is a stop-gap measure, the source said.\n\"The automotive companies have gone along with the substitution...but it's different material and they would prefer us to go back to the Martin Bright specifications,\" he said.\nAbout 130 workers walked off the job at the steel plant on April 11 in a dispute over wages. They have since picketed the site, preventing Email from moving stock out to its customers.\nIn letters sent last week to Australia's labour market watchdog, the Industrial Relations Commission, car-makers said they would be forced to halt production and stand down thousands of workers from this week if the strike did not end quickly.\nBut on Tuesday, Ford, Toyota and Mitsubishi told Reuters they could now maintain full production for at least another week, but perhaps for not for much longer.\nToyota and Mitsubishi spokesmen told Reuters production was guaranteed for at least \"this week\". Holden, which had warned it would be forced to shut down a production line on Thursday, said it did not now see disruptions to production \"at this stage\".\nThe four car-makers' have combined sales revenue of about A$6 billion, including over A$2 billion in export sales, and along with car-part manufacturers employ 45,000 people, according to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industry.\nThe Martin Bright Steel dispute has also hit other suppliers to the car-making industry. \"I am sure there are half a dozen others on the brink,\" the source said.\nThe Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), which wants a 15 percent wage rise over two years for the Martin Bright Steel workers, said on Tuesday the strike could escalate.\n\"We are talking about a major escalation of the dispute if they try to break that picket,\" AMWU organiser Craig Johnston told Reuters. A spokesman for Email was not available.\n(A$1 = US$0.78)\n", "Mercury Finance Co.'s woes deepened Friday when the company said it would be unable to pay $17 million in commercial debt due the same day and its stock lost 86 percent of its value.\nThe auto lender's stock tumbled $12.75 to close at $2.125 on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of more than 42 million shares after it opened for trading for the first time since Tuesday. It fell as low as $1.625.\nBased on the more than 172 million shares outstanding as of early November, that would mean a loss of more than $2.2 billion in market capitalisaiton for the company.\nOn Wednesday, the company said it found problems in its bookkeeping that caused it to overstate earnings by $90 million over four years.\nThe consumer finance and auto loan company said Friday that as a result of downgrades from several debt rating services, it would not be able to issue new short-term debt, known as commercial paper, to repay maturing debt and could not make the payments due Friday.\nStandard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Fitch Investors Service downgraded the company's commercial paper to a default rating.\nLake Forest, Ill.-based Mercury said it was in discussions with lenders to satisfy its working capital needs, but could not predict the outcome of the discussions.\nAnalysts said the company has another $100 million in commercial debt due next Thursday and that the company could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors if those discussions were unsuccessful.\n\"They're very close to some reorganization, bankruptcy filing, probably a voluntary reorganization,\" said Thomas Kmiotek, analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co.\nA finance company like Mercury makes money on the difference, or spread, between what it pays to borrow and the higher rates it charges customers. A finance company without a source of funds is like a retailer without a source of merchandise, analysts noted.\n\"If you can't fund, you're out of business,\" one analyst who follows the company said, requesting anonymity.\nA company spokesman did not return repeated phone calls seaking comment on Mercury's financing.\nThe company said in a statement that it had retained Salomon Brothers Inc. to advise it on current and future capital needs and related issues.\nMercury said on Wednesday it had to restate its earnings downward by about $90 million for the past four years because of accounting irregularities. It said the problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its controller, James Doyle.\nBut Doyle's lawyer reportedly accused Mercury of a charade and said Doyle was cooperating with federal authorities.\nA special committee of Mercury's board, formed to investigate the accounting problems, has instructed its lawyers to contact Doyle's attorney for information on the investigation, Mercury said Friday.\nDoyle's lawyer was out of town Friday and did not return phone calls.\nThe company said it also directed its lawyers and accounting firm to complete a thorough investigation of the company's auditing and accounting practices and report to the board.\nAnother class-action lawsuit accusing the company of violating securities laws by issuing misleading and false financial statements was filed in federal court in Chicago, bringing to at least four the number of such suits filed.\n", "Some airlines and freight forwarders say they anticipate a traditional mini-boom in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holiday starting on February 6, and despite space being available, rates are firmer than might be expected, a Reuters survey shows.\nBut industry sources also generally expect trans-Pacific rates to stay flat for the next couple of months.\nFollowing what was reported to be one of the busiest pre-Christmas peak periods seen in Hong Kong for many years, the start of 1997 has seen the trans-Pacific air cargo market slump back into familiar January doldrums.\nBut both airlines and freight forwarders say they are pleased to report that last year's \"disastrous\" January, which many said was the worst they had ever experienced, has not been repeated.\nIndustry spokesmen said many factories in China which airfreight their finished goods out of Hong Kong are awaiting a new round of export licences. As soon as they are granted in the next few days, both airlines and freight forwarders expect a rush from manufacturers anxious to complete shipments before factory production comes to a virtual standtill for the two week long holiday or more.\nMore than one freight forwarder complained that, despite the seasonal drop in demand, cargo rates have not dropped as much as had been expected.\nOne well known freight forwarder in the territory said airlines are unusually keen to do deals on rates which indicated they have space to fill. He was happy doing business for a 35 tonne shipment to Los Angeles earlier this week which cost around HK$15 per kilo.\n\"Airlines which never normally do deals are very keen this month which indicates there is spare capacity around,\" he said.\n\"The market is reasonably busy and there is quite a bit of freight around,\" he added.\nYoichi Tanaka managing director of freight forwarding firm Kintetsu World Express (HK) Ltd said despite a softening of demand, ex-HK rates to Japan were being deliberately held firm by airlines \"who think they can still make money from the current market.\"\n\"The market has seen its normal slow down both to Japan and trans-Pac compared with the peak season. Overall, for both air freight exports and imports, the market is better than last January,\" said Tanaka who is \"optimistically\" forecasting four to five cent growth over the next six months.\nYang Seung Joo, general manager for Korean Airlines Cargo in Hong Kong, was one airline executive who said that he was keen to maintain rate levels.\n\"We are trying to keep our prices as high as they were at the end of the year (during peak season). This year we will keep prices for all destinations a little bit higher than last year to protect our interests,\" he said.\nKAL has three freighters a week - two Boeing 747s and one Airbus A300 - from Hong Kong to Seoul plus a joint venture flight with Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.\nYang said demand was slack but business this year is better than last January which was the \"worst\" he had ever known. He \"cautiously\" expects this year to be better than last.\nStrike action in South Korea had not caused any disruption to KAL's cargo flights, Yang said.\nAnother key player on Japanese and trans-Pacific routes, Cathay Pacific said the market had \"softened\" but was still \"healthy\". Compared with Cathay's cargo services to Europe, the west-bound market was not as strong, Cathay Cargo's marketing and sales manager Ray Jewell said.\n\"We are pretty optimistic about trans-Pacific which finished the year very strongly and the fact that the market has now weakened is nothing unusual. What is unusual is the European market staying so bouyant. Overall we are looking pretty good for the start of the year,\" he said\nCathay said there will undoubtedly be a pre-Chinese New Year boom in business but any indication of how strong the market really is will not really be known until after the holiday\nDavid Sung, Hong Kong sales manager for Polar Air Cargo, which operates only trans-Pacific services from Hong Kong to Chicago, Colombus and New York, said the market had followed its traditional pattern and slumped after early January. Flights have been cancelled because of lack of demand.\nBut he said he was hopeful of a \"mini-peak season\" in the coming fortnight as factories in China rush to dispatch orders.\n\"The market is slowly picking up after being dead slow right after western new year. Chinese New Year is coming soon this year in early February and we expect a rush next week when we will operate a full schedule of five flights a week and are ready to put on additional flights if needed because we have aircraft available,\" Sung said.\nHe did not anticipate a rise in trans-Pacific rates in the lead-up to Chinese New Year.\nA spokesman for All Nippon Airlines Co Ltd and its subsidiary Nippon Cargo Airlines (NCA) was also anticipating a rush before Chinese New Year as mainly garment manufacturers in China are awarded export licences.\n\"I think the market will pick up next week as manufacturers hurry to get their orders out. Last January was terrible but this year it is better and we expect a rush,\" the spokesman said.\nHe also said the outlook on both trans-Pacific routes and those to Japan during spring was reasonably optimistic.\nBut Northwest Cargo, which said it is the largest US trans-Pacific carrier, was not anticipating any major rise in demand leading up to Chinese new year.\nAfter the pre-Christmas dash to meet year-end quotas the market has died down but, thankfully, not as much as last year. Northwest also cancelled flights in early January due to lack of demand.\n\"After the peak, rates have dropped but not substantially. I would say they are normal for this time of year. Concerning volumes, it's a case of so far so good,\" the Northwest spokesman said.\nHe also said there is currently a trade imbalance with exports far exceeding imports and demand for traffic to the U.S. East coast markedly higher than to the West coast.\nThomas Miu, general manager of the air freight division of Jardine Freight Services, was also pessimistic about a pre-holiday 'mini-boom'.\n\"I doubt very much whether we will see a little bit of a rush before Chinese New Year which is just two weeks away. I don't see any sign yet. I'm hoping we will have a boom before Easter,\" Mui said.\nA leading freight forwarder who uses a variety of airlines said space on flights from Hong Kong to New York was \"wide open\" with rates generally around HK$20.50. For destinations to the US west coast, average shipment prices were reported to be around $19.50.\nRates to Japan on so-called first-class carriers such as Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines Co Ltd are reported to be around $14 with around a $2 reduction at $12 for 'second tier' carriers such as United Airlines with no restriction problems on space.\nAnother trans-Pacific airline operating from Hong Kong, U.S.-based Evergreen International Airlines Inc, is operating a full schedule of four trans-Pacific freighter flights a week until Chinese New Year when, like many other carriers, all flights will be stopped as demand evaporates.\n\"The market is picking up after being a little bit slow which it usually is while people renew their export licences,\" reported Kersti Krepp. Trans-pacific rates remain firm, she added.\nJapan Airlines is not yet \"in full swing\" after the early January lull but is another optimistic airline expecting another busy period before Chinese new year. JAL offers four freighters per week to Tokyo's Narita airport in addition to at least five daily passenger flights to Narita and Osaka offering around 15 tonnes belly capacity each with trans-pacific connections.\n\"Rates to Japan are holding steady, very stable. Trans-pacfic rates are negotiatable with different deals being done. Exports from Hong Kong are also exceeding imports,\" a JAL spokesman told Reuters.\nThe importance of the Japanese and trans-Pacific markets to Hong Kong's economy can be seen from the latest cargo statistics for November from the territory's Civil Aviation Department.\nThey show more than 21,000 tonnes of air freight exports to the U.S. while imports amount only to less than 5,500 tonnes. New York's JFK airport accounts for 4,400 tonnes of exports, Los Angeles 3,225, Columbus Ohio 3.071, Chicago 1,800 tonnes and San Francisco 985 tonnes.\nFor Japan, the statistics show Tokyo's Narita airport is the second most popular export destination from Hong Kong after Taipei. 9,016 tonnes was airlifted to Tokyo compared with 9,441 tonnes to Taipei during November. But only 4,502 tonnes of cargo was airlifted from Tokyo to Hong Kong.

Terms were not disclosed.\nXerox also said the board voted to raise the quarterly dividend to 32 cents a share from 29 cents, an increase of 10 percent, payable April 1 to shareholders of record on March 7.\nFor the full year, Xerox earnings from continuing operations rose 3 percent $1.21 billion from $1.17 billion, in 1995. Including the charge for Talegen, Xerox lost $472 million in 1995.\nSales grew 5 percent to $17.38 billion from $16.59 billion.\n", "U.S. retailers are expected to post sales gains in the single digits for March, bolstered by low-end discount stores sales while department store performance was nearly flat compared with a year ago.\n\"It appears there's a slowdown in the department store end of the business, but the discounters are still doing well,\" Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said.\nOverall, he expects comparable-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be up about 5 percent or slightly less.\nAn early Easter could depress sales at stores that were closed on the holiday, which fell in the March selling period instead of April this year. Winter storms in much of the northern part of the nation may have also held sales back.\n\"You need to look at March and April overall to get comparable sales,\" William Armstrong, an analyst at Fahnestock &amp; Co. Inc. said of quirks in the reporting calendar, where some retailers include Easter in March and others in April this year.\nArmstrong is expecting overall retail sales for March to increase by 2 percent to 4 percent.\nMost retailers will report March sales early Thursday. But Plano, Tex.-based J.C. Penney Co. Inc. Tuesday reported a 3.7 percent decline in comparable-store sales at its JCPenney stores in March. The early report was due to a debt offering the company is making this week.\nThe loss of one day's sales because of Easter hurt sales, J.C. Penney said.\nPenney's decline is expected to be mirrored by other department stores, analysts said.\n\"Most (department store) chains saw flat or even slightly lower comparable sales during the March period, as they compared with healthy year-ago increases,\" analysts at Montgomery Securities wrote in a research report. They added that the early Easter and snowstorms in the Northeast added to pressure on sales.\nAt the same time, discount stores are expected to post 4 percent to 6 percent sales gains, with low-end discounters reporting low double-digit gains, Montgomery said.\n\"We continue to believe the low-end strata is benefitting from the fruits of a fully-employed economy and the direct pay-hike from the 1996 minimum wage increase,\" Montgomery's analysts wrote.\nAmong the major chains, analysts see Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, reporting same-store sales gains of about 7 percent. Sears, Roebuck and Co. was expected to report gains of 2 percent to 3 percent, with Kmart Corp. up 10 percent to 12 percent.\nKmart's results are expected to be driven by seasonal items, such as horticulture, home goods and bicycles. But it will give back some of those gains in April because of the calendar shift, analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a research note. Kmart stores were open on Easter, analysts added.\nDayton Hudson Corp. is expected to post a 1 percent to 2 percent gain, with a 3 percent to 4 percent increase at its Target discount stores offsetting flat department store sales. Federated Department Stores Inc. is expected to post flat sales, with some planned promotions moved into April, analysts said.\n", "Like any marriage, the $20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp. and British Telecommunications Plc may be smoothed by the experiences of the two-year courtship that preceded it.\n\"I may be an incurable romantic, but I think this is going to be a lot easier than people think,\" one BT insider said.\nConcert, the name of the planned merged company, was the original name for a global communications offspring conceived by the two companies in July 1994 to provide a one-stop shop for multinational corporations.\nWhile the executives atop the new merged company have a clear vision of where they are going, insiders and industry sources say the acid test will be how the engine rooms of networks, billing, support and customer service are melded.\nConcert, now called Concert Communication Services, was a wayward child in the early days, and progress was slowed by turf wars and bickering about which standard or system to use.\n\"Some of those turf wars were really destructive,\" said Daniel Briere, a consultant at TeleChoice Inc., who has worked with Concert Communications and its parents.\nA computer and software system to support prepaid Concert calling cards in Britain was delayed many months while BT and MCI managers each fought to have their own design used.\nSimilarly, a videophone product developed by BT for MCI failed on both sides of the Atlantic at a cost of millions of dollars.\n\"This huge 'hands across the water' friendship never worked in practice that I saw,\" Briere said.\nHowever, sources inside both companies believe the tough decisions have already been made and that a unified management can more easily fix the remainder precisely because of the experience they already have in working together.\n\"Those debates by and large are behind us,\" said MCI chief engineering officer Fred Briggs. \"A unified management always shortens the decision-making process some.\"\n\"It may sound weird, but you take out the need for cooperation (in a merger),\" TeleChoice's Briere said. \"You can choose the best and discard the rest.\"\nConcert Communications is already producing evidence of this. The venture has $1.5 billion of revenue under contract and has networks active in 800 cities in 50 countries.\nIt has a head start over rival alliances Global One and Unisource, backed by Sprint Corp. and AT&amp;T Corp., respectively.\nSome analysts see a danger of wrangles being duplicated across the entire company as senior management attempt to fuse two corporations with such widely different roots.\nBT began as a government-owned monopoly while MCI cut its teeth fighting a onetime monopoly, AT&amp;T. BT controls 90 percent of the British market while MCI has struggled for 20 percent of the U.S. long-distance market.\nThe size of the combined company makes some worry that MCI's nimbleness and aggressiveness will be lost.\nThe new Concert will be one of the three largest telephone companies in the world, with revenues of $42 billion, 183,000 employees and a pro-forma market capitalisation of $54 billion.\n\"Customers will expect a lot more from MCI now it is on an equal footing with AT&amp;T. It will be harder for MCI to retain that scrappy, upstart image,\" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.\nPotential flashpoints could be the need to use BT billing and support systems to help pry open the $90 billion a year U.S. local calling markets. Though MCI has advanced billing systems, it has never had to cope with this scale of attack.\nA second may be international calling. BT and MCI plan to replicate calling plans like MCI's Friends and Family, which was used to great effect within the United States, to cement customer ties on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\"There are plans in the works for that sort of thing,\" said the BT insider, who declined to be identified.\nBut BT has never had to administer calling plans of the complexity that MCI has used, which generate a very high level of customer service queries.\nThe two companies also plan to use Britain as a conduit for grabbing international business calling from continental Europe and route it through London to the United States.\nAnother major issue is what type of technology to use to bring Internet and multimedia applications to U.S. homes. BT is expected to be closely involved as a pioneer in so-called broadband technologies.\n\"That is going to be a major decision,\" MCI's Briggs said.\nEven though the top executives work very well together, they do not always have perfect judgment.\nBriere said MCI's two biggest previous alliances, a $2 billion media alliance with News Corp. and the $1 billion takeover of Canada's SHL Systemhouse, both in 1995, have not produced the benefits expected.\n\"Both News Corp. and SHL have failed to meet investment expectations,\" said Briere.\n", "Far East metals traders were preoccupied with one question on Monday -- will China buy copper in the midst of the current rally, or are prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) nearing precarious heights?\nThere was little doubt in the minds of most traders and industry sources polled by Reuters that copper prices would continue their heady rise.\nCopper on the LME finished Friday trading substantially higher, with technical buying and aggressive short covering taking the red metal to fresh 8-1/2 months highs despite an unexpected stocks increase of 1,875 tonnes.\nIt was $2,366 a tonne at the afternoon kerb close, off the day's $2,375 high but up $38 from Thursday's finish.\nPrices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) have been mirroring the LME's rises since trading resumed last week after the long Lunar New Year holiday.\nShanghai copper futures started higher on Monday, with the most active May 1997 contract opening at 23,500 yuan ($2,831) a tonne, rising 190 yuan from last week's close. It fell back a little to 23,460 yuan in early trading.\nTrading sources in Hong Kong and Singapore said that as long as Shanghai rises along with the LME -- and as long as the LME continues to rise -- the Chinese should not be scared away from the market.\n\"We're starting to see the start of glimmers of interest from China to start re-importing metal they lent,\" a trader in Singapore said.\n\"But it is difficult at these high prices to see a lot of Chinese buying, though the fact remains that if they need it, there seems to be so little on the ground in China that they will have to buy it,\" he said.\nShanghai Metal Exchange figures show copper stocks at 17,524 tonnes, a level described by one Western trader as \"nothing\".\nThe head of a big Hong Kong trading house said there had been some signs of Chinese buying in recent weeks.\n\"But it's just a few hundred tonnes here, a few hundred tonnes there,\" he said, adding he had seen no indication that China's central reserve authorities had been in the market.\n\"They (Chinese end-users) do need to buy but they could be scared off by these price levels,\" he said. \"I think the LME will go higher -- I believe it will break $2,400 (a tonne) before we see a correction.\"\nPremiums on copper arrivals in Shanghai are now $120 a tonne over LME cash metals pushing the price close to $2,500 a tonne, an analyst here said.\nArbitrage opportunities were seen kept in check by high costs -- three percent import duty and 17 percent value-added tax (VAT).\n\"You're looking at healthy arbitrage opportunities looming, as long as there are discounts on the VAT,\" another Western source said, adding that big traders were often able to get waivers on the VAT.\nBeijing's States Statistical Bureau last week released figures showing China's January copper production level at 70,000 tonnes, up 2.2 percent on January 1996.\nChina's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes, up 5.71 percent on 1995, the bureau said.\nPhysical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.\nChinese media reported last month that China's 1997 copper demand should rise five percent over last year to 1.05 million tonnes. Output is expected to be more than 900,000 tonnes.\nCopper imports are expected to remain high, the newspaper said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes.\n", "AMEC Plc, the British building and engineering group, saw first half pretax profits double on Thursday and pledged to reward investors with final dividend growth in the second half after freezing the latest payout.\nPretax profits for the six months to June 30 rocketed to 12.1 million pounds ($18.96 million) from 6.1 million. Sales were 1.32 billion versus 1.13 billion.\nAMEC chief executive Peter Mason told Reuters \"We would hope to improve the dividend at the year end,\" after freezing the interim payout at 1.5 pence per share.\nMason explained the reason for the conservative payout:\"On balance we felt it was better to have a dividend which was covered rather than try for a small increase. But we will deal with it properly at the year end.\"\nThe chief was confident that profits would be better than last year after announcing in the results statement that turnover should hit the targeted 2.75 billion pounds.\nAMEC's shares were up 2 1/2 pence higher at 98 at 1104 GMT.\nThe AMEC chief also told Reuters that as part of his strategic review, kicked off seven months ago, he aimed to boost the group's international sales through acquisitions and partnerships.\nMason has targeted raising overseas sales to 50 percent of total turnover from the current 30 percent in the long term.\n\"All options are open,\" he said, adding that the preferred route for expansion is through partnerships and small acquisitions.\n\"I see no merit in acquisitions in basic building and civil engineering businesses, but I want companies offering value-added technology and design,\" he said. Several deals are already under discussion.\nAMEC, which fought off a hostile takeover from Norway's Kvaerner which still holds 26 percent of its shares, had said earlier this year that a number of companies in South East Asia were interested in buying up this stake in bits to cement business links.\nThis move was seen as a route to expanding sales in the region.\nTurning to the interim's divisional results - mechanical and electrical sales rose 20 percent.\nBuilding and civil engineering sales rose 28 percent, despite severe problems in the West German market hit by low infrastructure spending and sluggish conditions.\nAs a result AMEC is seeking to transfer some of its resources to the brisker East German market.\nProcess and energy returned to profit in 1996, but Mason predicts stronger figures in 1997 once the rationalisation benefits kick in. Housing sales were up 11 percent.\n($1=.6382 Pound)\n", "Talks in Beijing on the fate of a senior Pyongyang defector have made progress but have not clinched a deal despite a personal bid by North Korea's foreign minister to break the deadlock.\n\"There has been some headway. Negotiations are still going on,\" Chang Moon-ik, spokesman for the South Korean embassy in Beijing, said on Tuesday about talks on Hwang Jang-yop, who sought refuge in Seoul's Beijing consulate four weeks ago.\nHwang, a senior North Korean ideological theoritician and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il, has been stranded in the consular compound since February 12 while the three nations negotiate his fate.\nOfficials in South Korea said on Monday they expected a breakthrough this week in talks with China aimed at securing Hwang's passage out of Beijing, but Chang said it was unlikely he would be moved in the next few days.\n\"Final arrangements have yet to be done... There has been no final decision,\" Chang said by telephone.\nChina said on Tuesday that North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam visited Beijing last Saturday in what analysts said was an apparent bid by Pyongyong to break the three-way deadlock.\nHwang, chief architect of Pyongyang's ruling ideology of Juche, or self-reliance, is the highest North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai played down Kim's visit, saying he was only passing through the Chinese capital on his way to Africa and his trip \"did not touch on any special problem\".\nWeeks of talks over Hwang's fate, interrupted by the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month, have failed to produce an accord as Beijing finds itself torn between an old communist ally and a new capitalist friend.\nAnalysts say Hwang will likely end up in Seoul but Beijing is anxious to help North Korea save face by being seen to give due consideration to the hermit nation's concerns.\n\"We want to bring Mr Hwang to Seoul directly but if that is not possible we can make other arrangements,\" embassy spokesman Chang said. Korean sources have said Hwang may be whisked away to another country, possibly in Southeast Asia.\nArmed Chinese police backed by armoured personnel carriers and a crowd control truck maintained a tight security cordon around Seoul's consular compound, in Beijing's normally sedate diplomatic quarter, where Hwang is holed up.\nBeijing has appealed to North and South Korea to stay calm during attempts to end the diplomatic standoff sparked by Hwang's defection.\nChinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last week Beijing was still investigating Hwang's case and hoped for a solution as soon as possible.\nNorth Korea initially accused the South of kidnapping Hwang, then changed its hardline stance by saying that if he really had defected he was a traitor and would be dismissed.\nBeijing, which sent its armies to fight on Pyongyang's side during the 1950-1953 Korean War, established diplomatic links with Seoul only in 1992.\n", "New York State utility regulators are set to approve the Bell Atlantic Corp/NYNEX Corp merger, subject to several conditions, to be set forth prior to a final vote set for Thursday.\nRegulators will consider demanding the combined company permanently locate its headquarters in New York, reduce rates, issue $300 million in rebates and improve customer service.\nThese conditions were among those considered at a hearing Wednesday of the N.Y. Public Service Commission in Albany, the state capitol, which will be taken up at tommorrow's meeting.\nThe merger would create the nation's largest local phone operator and still faces hurdles in Washington, as well as New York, the only state now withholding its approval.\nIn Washington, the combination reportedly has met with increased scrutiny in recent weeks from anti-trust officials at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. Federal officials have issued new subpeonas requesting details on rivals' plans to offer local phone service in New York.\nThe deal still faces an ongoing anti-trust review by New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco, who argues the merger strengthens NYNEX's existing monopoly and represents a bad deal for N.Y. residential and small business customers.\n\"We are watching closely the review being conducted by the PSC,\" said Joe Mahoney, a spokeman in the office of the Attorney General, the state's top anti-trust regulator.\nVacco may issue a statement on the subject if the PSC makes its decision Thursday, the spokesman said.\nRegulators seek to balance the economic benefits and efficencies created by the merger with any negatives that may arise by strengthening NYNEX's grip on local service and the potential that has to slow the entry of new competitors.\nA report by the staff of the N.Y. Public Service Commission discussed at Wednesday's hearing before the three-member panel argued that NYNEX and its merger partner should be required to immediately refund roughly $300 million.\nThe figure represents one third of the $908 million the report estimated would be the economic benefit of the deal.\nThe companies dispute this figure, arguing the potential benefit is likely to reach only $600 million by the third year of the deal, according to Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith.\nConsumer advocates, who oppose the merger, have countered that the companies should rebate $1.25 billion immediately to consumers, a figure that includes an estimated cost of the loss of competition resulting from the merger. That represents 15 percent of the gains the combined Bell Atlantic could expect to enjoy in the coming five years, they maintain.\nHowever, two of the three commissioners called for any decision about a customer rebate be postponed until a more complete picture of the impact of the deal emerges.\nCommission members asked whether the impact should be based on current estimates or whether the determination should wait to see what happens to pricing after the entry of new competitive forces and any savings achieved by the merger.\nThey also called for other tangible economic benefits to the state, such as strong assurances that the company's primary headquarters will be located in New York.\nCommissioner Thomas Duleavy called for the New York corporate headquarters of the company \"not to be one of form, but one of substance.\"\nCommissioners also said they want to see more tangible benefits for wholesale and retail NYNEX customers.\nThey also may decide to increase an existing plan designed to spur NYNEX to improve its long-criticized customer support operations. One proposal would demand that NYNEX increase hiring of customer support personnel and rapidly bring service quality up to the standards of Bell Atlantic.\nAlso Thursday, the commission approved a two-zone pricing plan that would allow NYNEX competitors to selectively choose which services they purchase from the local phone company as they offer local phone services of their own.\nA press advisory issued after Wednesday's meeting said the NYPSC had \"reserved a final decision on the NYNEX - Bell Atlantic merger until a special Commission session scheduled for Thursday.\"\nThe meeting is set to for 1000 EST/1500 GMT in Albany.\nBell Atlantic closed Wednesday down 1-7/8 to 63-3/8. NYNEX fell 1-3/4 at 47-3/8. The declines reflected a broad decline among Baby Bell stocks and the stock market in general.\n-- New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736\n", "The Czech parliament began debate on Tuesday on a post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany which the Prague government sees as key to EU and NATO membership, while opposition deputies call it a betrayal.\nIt faces a potentially long and unpleasant fight in the Czech lower house, especially from the ultra-right Republican Party and the Communists, who claim it lets Germany off lightly for Nazi attrocities and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.\nDeputies voted narrowly to move the sensitive declaration, which was already signed last month by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to the top of the agenda for the session.\n\"The declaration was adopted in the (German parliament) two weeks ago with a large majority. I believe the Czech parliament will approach it in the same way,\" Klaus told the chamber.\nIn the accord, Bonn expresses regret for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague its sorrow for brutality in post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans.\nThe text also includes German support for Czech membership of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).\nKlaus said the accord was an important international message that the Czech Republic does not have open political issues with its neighbours.\nThe declaration does not need to be ratified by parliament but a rejection by deputies would embarrass Klaus's minority coalition government, which wants as strong a show of support.\nThe Republicans have promised a filibuster in an attempt to block the declaration from coming to a vote, but analysts believe the measure will pass, if just narrowly.\nA vote, technically, could come later on Tuesday, but many expect the debate to take days.\nThe main opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) have not said if they will support the declaration and have sought a separate parliamentary resolution, partly on the grounds that the text does not acknowledge the legal validity of the Czechs' actions.\nBut Klaus told deputies that the accord respected legal norms in both states and did not question the results of the 1945 Potsdam conference, at which the Czechoslovak government was given the right to expel the ethnic Germans.\nHe also said the text did not affect Czechs' rights to property seized from the ethnic Germans.\nThe CSSD leadership has agreed to allow its members a free vote, probably ensuring that the government will get the votes it needs from the opposition to approve the accord.\n\"I know about three or four Social Democrats who would vote for the declaration,\" CSSD vice-chairman Karel Machovec told Reuters, saying he was among those who would vote in favour.\nThe accord remains controversial in Germany, where relatives and supportes of the Sudeten Germans have demanded restitution of proerty confiscated by the Czechs.\n\"The Czech Republic in accordance with its legal order and many norms of international law, considers these ownership questions to be definitely closed,\" Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told the house.\nThe parliamentary group of Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) on Tuesday rejected calls for a separate resolution which might provide a Czech interpretation of the declaration.\nBut Machovec said a separate joint resolution would ensure a larger majority in favour of the declaration.\n", "Summit Medical Systems Inc., said Monday its 1996 revenues will be \"substantially less\" than what it reported last week due to accounting discrepancies discovered by its new chief financial officer, who resigned after less than a week on the job.\nThe company, which makes computer-based information systems for the healthcare industry, said it expected to revise downward the $19.5 million in revenues it reported in 1996, and could also cut revenues for 1995 and 1994 as well.\nCompany officials were not available to comment.\nSummit's shares fell by $1.44, or 30 percent, to $3.31 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market.\nVolpe, Welty &amp; Co. analyst Chris Paul said Summit was believed to have about $40 million in cash and roughly 10.5 million shares.\n\"So it's trading below its cash value,\" he said. Still, he added, the cash the company is believed to have was \"providing a base for the shares.\"\nMinneapolis-based Summit said a preliminary review of its books indicated that revenues for the past three years had been overstated by between $4 million and $6 million -- or between 8 percent and 12 percent of the total.\nSummit said the concerns over its revenues stem from the erroneous recognition of some revenues from the sales of software and related services.\nPaul said the company did not provide any further explanation to analysts on a conference call.\n\"Summit Medical is extremely concerned by the discovery of accounting errors and is working vigorously to correct past mistakes and to establish stricter management controls and policies,\" Chief Executive Kevin Green said in a statement.\nThe company also announced that it planned to eliminate an unspecified number of jobs and establish a cost reduction programme to reduce annual expenses by 20 percent.\nThat programme is expected to result in an unspecified charge in the current quarter for employee severance and other costs, it said.\nLast Wednesday, Summit reported 1996 revenues of $19.5 million, up from $17.7 million in 1995. It also posted a net loss for the year of $10.4 million, compared with a year-ago loss of $7.2 million.\nThe exact size of the adjustments to revenue and the years in which they apply will not be determined until an extensive audit is completed, the company said Monday.\nSummit said that Donald Haas, who joined the company as chief financial officer last Monday, resigned Saturday -- after informing management that some 1996 revenue had been incorrectly recognised.\nThe company said that Haas told management on Thursday, the day after the company reported its 1996 results, that it had incorrectly recognised revenue during 1996 in some circumstances.\nManagement immediately began a review of these issues, it added.\n\"The company's auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, have expanded the scope of their audit and are performing additional audit procedures based in part on the questions raised by Mr. Haas,\" Summit said in its statement.\nSummit added that it had retained the law firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP to investigate the matter with the assistance of independent accounting advice from Arthur Andersen LLP.\nThe company said it expected to announce corrected financial information by the end of March.\nThe likely downward revision of revenues for at least a year comes at a time when Summit is in the midst of a product transition, said Paul.\nThe transition, Paul explained, is to a single platform for Summit's computerized information system, which collects and analyses patient data and likely outcomes. This anlaysis enables health care providers to monitor and potentially change a patient's treatment.\n", "Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, urged Australia on Monday to press China into talks over the future of the remote Himalayan region and said he was ready to visit Beijing in the right \"atmosphere\".\nSeen by Beijing as the leader of a pro-independence movement in Tibet, the Dalai Lama said he wanted to ask Australian Prime Minister John Howard to press China into opening a dialogue on the political future of Tibet.\n\"In case I have the opportunity of meeting (Howard), the main thing which I want to mention is...to appeal to the Australian government to help to materialise meaningful negotiations with the Chinese government,\" the Dalai Lama told a news conference in Melbourne.\nA meeting with Howard, who returns from an overseas trip toward the end of the Dalai Lama's two-week trip, has yet to be arranged, but Howard has not ruled out talks despite warnings from Beijing against official contact with the Tibetan god king.\nChina has already chided New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger for meeting the Dalai Lama in Wellington last week.\nAustralian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer met the Dalai Lama on his arrival in Sydney on Saturday night, but said later that the talks were unofficial.\nThe Dalai Lama, exiled from Tibet since 1959, told the news conference the prospects for negotiations with Beijing had faded since his emissary met China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, partly due to domestic politics and frosty Sino-U.S. relations.\n\"At the moment the Chinese government, their main concern is to simply show the world and also their own people they are a big nation... No-one can influence them,\" he said.\nThe Dalai Lama, who wants a form of regional autonomy for Tibet, suggested that Beijing's \"one China-two systems\" policy governing its takeover of Hong Kong next year, and its goal of reunification with Taiwan, could serve as a model for Tibet.\n\"All these things are the more humane way,\" he said, adding he was ready to visit Beijing. \"As soon as some appropriate atmosphere develops, I am ready to visit China,\" he added.\nThe 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner also accused China of continuing to detain his seven-year-old spiritual deputy, the Panchen Lama.\n\"My Panchen Lama in effect is the youngest political prisoner. Seven years old. How sad,\" he said of Tibet's second holiest monk, believed to be the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama who died in Beijing in 1989.\n\"According to (my) information, he is somewhere near Beijing, as a prisoner under house arrest,\" the Dalai Lama said, adding that he feared for the boy's life.\nChina last month denied it was holding the boy but refused to recognise him as the 11th Panchen Lama. Beijing has instead installed its own new Panchen Lama, a boy of the same age.\n\"Tibetan Buddhist culture at the moment is facing a threat of extinction ...Whether intentionally or unintentionally, some kind of cultural genocide is taking place in our country,\" the Dalai Lama said.\n", "The surprise purchase by Australia's biggest gambler, Kerry Packer, of control at the Sydney casino was welcomed by investors and analysts on Monday.\nShares in Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd (SHC), which owns the Sydney casino and Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL), were both up after the deal.\nAnalysts said the deal was good for both companies as Packer's influence was likely to yield a tax-concession for the casino on the high-roller market, which is seen boosting cash flow for both the casino and PBL's coffers.  \nUnder the deal, PBL will buy 10 percent of SHC for A$1.85 per share from Showboat Inc and pay the U.S. casino operator A$240 million for management control of the casino.\nThe casino deal is likely to put any plans Packer has of controlling newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd on the back-burner, analysts said.\nPBL has a 15 percent stake in Fairfax and Packer has said he would like to control Fairfax.  \nSHC, which holds a 12-year monopoly to operate the only legal casino in Australia's largest city, has battled with the New South Wales (NSW) state government for the past 16 months to get a similar tax rate to other Australian casinos.\n\"I think Packer will probably get the tax-break from the government,\" one Sydney-based casino analyst said. \"I expect there will be some tax-break announcement this month,\" he said.\nThe Sydney casino is seeking a 10 percent tax concession from the NSW government on big spending gamblers, mainly from Asia, compared with the present tax rate of 27 percent.  \nSHC chief executive Neil Gamble told Reuters last month the tax-break could equate up to A$100 million in new revenue and about A$10 million to the casino's bottom line profit.\nAnalysts said PBL would improve the running of the casino, which has consistently failed to meet its profit forecasts.\n", "British brewing to leisure group Bass Plc said on Monday it had sold 47 Holiday Inn full service hotels and 14 Holiday Inn management contracts in the mid-market sector in North America to the Bristol Hotel Company.\nIn return Bass will take a 36.1 percent stake in Bristol, which it plans to retain, plus loan repayments totalling $300 million and $91 million in cash, to be used in the business.\nThis results in a total value of $640 million for the deal, although based on the closing price of Bristol stock on Friday it is valued at $659 million.\nBass' decision to sell the hotels fits with its declared strategy of expanding its Holiday Inn franchise system and exiting from owning and managing hotels in areas where it has established a presence in franchising.\n\"We have always seen franchising as our primary business. Owning and managing hotels is simply a means of supporting that operation,\" said Bass finance director Richard North.\n\"We have reached the point in the U.S. where that is no longer necessary and where we are at the appropriate time in the cycle to sell these assets,\" said North in an interview.\nThe 61 hotels transferred, which have a book value of $638 million, generated profits of $69 million in the financial year to September 30 after payment of franchise fees. Bristol will spend $150 million on refurbishing the properties over the next three years.\nBass, which confirmed last week it was in talks with Bristol, said the deal would have no significant effect on its earnings.\nIn a separate statement issued in New York Bristol said the acquisition should improve earnings slightly in 1997, excluding the cost of integrating the 61 hotels and transaction fees.\nHoliday Inn franchisees in the United States get about 33 percent of their occupancy through the Holiday Inn reservation system compared with 13 percent on average in Europe.\n\"We believe we are way up on the cycle in the U.S. In fact our assessment is that there is a little bit left to go, but of course you can only really tell with hindsight,\" said North, referring to property prices in the United States.\nBass shares were off 15p at 800p after the stock went ex-dividend from the start of trading on Monday.\n\"It allows them to get out at a reasonable price and invest the cash in areas of expansion like the Far East,\" said Dermott Carr, an analyst at Nikko Europe.\nBristol also agreed to convert a further 10 of its 39 existing hotels to the Holiday Inn brand. These conversions, together with the 61 hotels transferred under the deal, will result in 84 out of 100 Bristol properties being named Holiday Inn or Crowne Plaza.\nBass owns 60 Holiday Inns in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 39 in the Asia-Pacific region. It has no plans to sell its Crowne Plaza hotels in North America.\nUnder the Holiday Inn franchise scheme, hoteliers pay a fee to join, relative to room numbers, plus five percent of gross room revenues per annum. They also pay a 0.5 percent fee for access to the computer booking system and a one percent annual fee for marketing, both linked to room revenue.\n", "BAB Holdings Inc, which is still digesting its $29 million acquisition of Chesapeake Bagel Bakery, said it expects to buy more independent chains to expand its national presence as bagels grow in popularity.\n\"We probably get a call a week from independent bagel companies looking to be acquired,\" said Michael Evans, president of BAB, which operates Big Apple Bagels.\nHe added that while BAB is open to acquisitions, the focus in the near-term is integrating Chesapeake, which the company agreed to acquire earlier this year.  \nGoing forward, BAB will operate stores under the Big Apple Bagels and Chesapeake names, he added.\nThe opportunity to expand reflects the growing popularity of bagels, which have become a staple for many Americans as a substitute for bread, Evans said.\nEvans reiterated that BAB, which will have 285 units after it completes its Chesapeake acquisition, hopes to have 800 units at the end of five years.\n\"If you take all the national chains, we have maybe 1,000 to 1,100 units. We're a long way from market saturation,\" Evans added in an interview.  \nAnalyst Ernest Andberg of R.J. Steichen &amp; Co said bagel restaurants are in their infancy in terms of growth potential. \"There is significant room to grow chains now,\" he said.\nR.J. Steichen, which was the underwriter for BAB when it went public in November 1995, rates the stock a buy.\nAlso adding units are Quality Dining Inc's Bruegger's Corp, the largest U.S. bagel chain, Einstein/Noah Bagel Corp, and Manhattan Bagel Co Inc, Andberg said. He added he believes BAB is well positioned to expand particularly in smaller markets in part because its units require a relatively modest capital investment.  \nAndberg added that BAB, which is headquartered in Chicago, makes its bagels from scratch on premise, which eliminates distribution concerns to serve smaller markets.\nEvans said BAB, which has both franchised units and a growing number of company-owned stores, sees a \"huge potential\" in secondary markets. He added BAB would locate in a smaller city if it could draw from a surrounding population base of 25,000 to 35,000 people.\nEvans said BAB also hopes to expand its Brewster's Coffee Co, which it acquired recently, including units in smaller towns.\nEvans declined to give earnings and sales growth targets for BAB, which had a net loss in fiscal 1995 of $0.19 a share due to expansion costs. Earlier this month, BAB said it expects fiscal 1996 revenues, excluding the Chesapeake acquisition, to more than triple 1995 revenues of $2.0 million.\nReuters Chicago Newsdesk - 312-408-8787\n", "Cargo airlines may fly elsewhere if the cost of using Hong Kong's new airport is dramatically increased, the Orient Airlines Association (OAA) director-general Richard Stirland said.\nStirland, speaking from Manila, told Reuters he is alarmed at reports that charges may double when Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok replaces Kai Tak in 1998.\nThe OAA  represents 16 of the major carriers in Asia including Singapore Airlines Ltd, Japan Airlines Co Ltd, Thai Airways International Ltd and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd,\nStirland said some airlines - especially cargo carriers - may bypass Hong Kong for cheaper alternatives nearby such as Macau, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.\n\"You may get a situation as in Europe where freighter operators don't need to go to Heathrow or Paris-Charles de Gaulle and use smaller, cheaper alternatives instead,\" he added.\nIt currently costs around US$24,000 for a two hour stop in Hong Kong compared to $23,000 at Singapore's Changi, he said.\nThe new Hong Kong Airport Authority has said charges will \"inevitably rise\" but added that reports that they will double are \"pure speculation.\"\nA spokeswoman said it will not be until early next year how that a decision will be taken on how much it will cost after the airlines have been consulted.\nThe charges will then have to be approved by Hong Kong's Director of Civil Aviation.\nA spokesman for one of the major users of the new airport, Hong Kong's de facto flag carrier Cathay Pacific said it is concerned at price rises which would have to be passed on to airline passengers and cargo customers.\n\"There is a big concern about fees rising which would damage all airlines and Hong Kong as a regional hub.

He said Canada would love to eliminate all tariffs in wood and paper trade, but APEC was divided on the issue.\nOfficials said they also hoped to make progress on streamlining customs regulations, which often cost small and medium-sized businesses crucial time and money in international trade.\n\"For these people, (customs red tape is) not merely an inconvenience like it is for big business,\" an official said. \"It's a block.\"\nAs the APEC trade ministers prepared for their first dinner together Thursday, Canadian labour leaders called on them to focus on human rights in Indonesia.\nThe labour leaders said they opposed the imprisonment of Muchtar Pakpahan, an Indonesian trade union leader and dissident.

For all of 1995, Kellogg posted net income of $761.6 million before one-time charges.\nThe Battle Creek, Mich.-based company blamed competitive promotions by others in the cereal category for the decline in its third-quarter profits.\nEarlier this year Kellogg and other leading cereal makers cut retail cereal prices. At the same time, Kellogg reduced promotional spending, such as offering special discounts in supermarkets.\nKellogg said it has cut back on promotional spending for more than two years.\n\"We will continue to direct our efforts away from deep price promotion; however, we are unwilling to see our leadership position comprised,\" Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement issued late Wednesday.\nAnalysts interpreted that as a warning that Kellogg might cut prices further or increase its own promotional spending if competitors continue their promotional practices in an effort to gain market share.\nKellogg accounts for nearly one-third of the U.S. cereal market, followed by General Mills Inc. with about one-quarter of U.S. sales. Third-place Post Cereals, including its Nabisco brands, accounts for about 17 percent of the U.S. market.\n\"It appears that Kellogg will be forced to deviate from its strategy of reducing promotions and will increase promotions to defend its market share,\" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said.\nOn Thursday O'Neil reduced his estimate for Kellogg's 1996 earnings to $3.10 a share from $3.30 and his 1997 estimate to $3.60 a share from $3.70.\n\"If competitors do not scale back their promotional spending, (Kellogg) may reaccelerate its own spending or resort to another price cut,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez wrote in a report.\nEarlier this year Kellogg had predicted its earnings for 1996 would match the $3.48 a share it earned in 1995.\nWhile many analysts at the time questioned Kellogg's ability to meet that target, the magnitude of the drop in the current earnings outlook took the market by surprise.\n", "British composite insurer Commercial Union Plc on Tuesday announced a major restructuring of its domestic general insurance operations to improve profitability and customer service.\nThe shake-up is aimed at producing some 100 million pounds ($163.5 million) of savings annually by 1999, largely through the reduction of administration and claims supply chain costs.\nBut the company was quick to emphasise that no jobs were under threat.\n\"Provided we meet our overall strategic objectives there won't be any compulsory redundancies. There is no hidden agenda here to lose jobs,\" said Andy Homer, manager of Commercial Union's UK general insurance division.\nDubbed 'Market Orientation', the changes will see head office functions reorganised into customer-focused trading units built around specific market segments and distribution channels, the company said.\nThere will be nine new trading units, each focused on one market sector. They will handle product development, underwriting, marketing and delivery.\nUnderwriters, marketers, finance and information technology staff will all work in teams, with the task of focusing on customer needs and Commercial Union believes it is the first British insurer to take this cross-functional approach.\n\"Market Orientation will create an innovative, team-based commercial culture and ensure that we establish ourselves as the pre-eminent force in the UK insurance market,\" said Cees Schrauwers, managing director of Commercial Union non-life insurance.\nThe company hopes to save 40 million pounds through more effective management of the claims supply chain, which accounts for five percent of the 800 million pound annual claims bill.\nIt already has a sole supplier agreement for windshields with Autoglass.\nThe benefits will be shared by customers as well as shareholders, Schrauwers said.\nAround 40 million pounds of savings are targeted from administration costs through greater use of new technology.\nFour of the group's 22 branches -- Liverpool, Manchester Bristol and Southampton -- have already piloted the changes.\nAnother 20 million pounds are to come from new modelling software to improve pricing and margins.\nMany of the costs involved in the programme have already been incurred as normal business expenses, Homer said.\n\"In 1998 and 1999 we believe we can complete the programme.

But it requires companies to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to crack the codes by getting access to the software keys.\nThe government says it needs the ability to crack strong encryption to catch criminals and terrorists.\nWhile a few companies, most notably International Business Machines, have obtained export licenses under the new policy, most high-tech companies remain frustrated.\nThey want to be able to export very strong encryption without including the government access features.\nPrivacy advocates also oppose the current Clinton policy, which they say puts too much power in the hands of government.\nSince the government does not require guaranteed access to the keys to one's home, it should not be given such access to the keys to one's data, they argue. \"My lock, my key,\" is the slogan on their buttons this week.\nIn congress, the passage of time has crystallised the issue for many members and both sides in the debate have found new allies. Last year, most lawmakers seemed either in favour of relaxed export restrictions or undecided.\nThe full Senate Commerce Committee will hear testimony Wednesday on two bills introduced in the Senate to remove almost all export restrictions, and Thursday, the House Judiciary subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property will debate a similiar bill under consideration there.\nAt the House encryption hearing, Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch, deputy director of the National Security Agency William Crowell and a member of the Department of Justice criminal division, will defend the Clinton policy.\nThe Senate will also hear from FBI director Louis Freeh and special encryption envoy David Aaron.\nIndustry representatives at the hearings will include officials from Netscape Communications Corp., one of the most vocal administration critics, and Microsoft Corp.\nPrivacy advocates will testify in the House, including Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology, and Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Centre.\n", "Czech engineering group Skoda a.s., a local agent for U.S.-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.

They would supply the fighters, and we would supply Czech goods to the States, namely Tatras and other things... And I know from the American side that this project has the support of the U.S. government,\" Samec added.\nThe Czechs along with former Warsaw Pact allies Poland and Hungary, all seen as frontrunners to join NATO, want to upgrade their fleets to be compatible with the military alliance.\nMcDonnell Douglas is competing against U.S. Lockheed Martin , makers of the F-16, Sweden's SAAB, which makes the \"Gripen\", France's \"Mirage\", and other groups to update a fleet of ageing Soviet-made Mig-21 planes.\nHowever, the Czech government has delayed a decision on buying the planes as proposed cuts in defence spending have clouded the debate over the upgrading the army's aging fighters.\nA spokesman at the Defence Ministry was not immediately avbailable for comment.\nThe Czech military has said it would need about 24 fighters to replace its old MiG-21s, while Hungary said it needs around 30 and Poland 100.\nSamec said the deal would be for new or used F/A-18 \"Hornets\", and would help the heavily-indebted Tatra, whose production has fallen to a fraction of communist-era levels.\n\"It would be a penetration (for Tatra) into the world's most important market... and it is advantageous because the Tatras have Detroit Diesel motors, so it could be used perhaps in the U.S. army,\" said Samec.\nNone of the fighter producers has publicly stated a price at which they would sell their planes to the Czech government.\nAnalysts say the planes typically cost over $20 million a piece new without supplementary equipment and technology. A cheaper option would be to buy second-hand planes at a fraction of the cost.\n", "Diametrics Medical Inc plans to be profitable by the 1998 third quarter and generate revenues of $3.5 million this year, $8 million in 1997 and $18 million in 1998, said chief executive David Giddings.\n\"Our objective is to have our first profitable quarter in the third quarter of '98,\" Giddings said in an interview with Reuters at a Dain Bosworth conference here on Wednesday.\nHe said Diametrics -- a maker of hospital-bedside blood gas analysis systems -- has failed to deliver on its promises in the past, but he added, \"That wasn't on my watch.\"  \nDiametrics reported a 1995 year-end loss of $23 million.\nThe company expects to launch its new IRMA SL blood gas analyzer system this month. \"The way the market should judge us is by what we do over the next three months,\" he said.\nHe added that the company has several options before it in the way of possible corporate alliances.\nThe IRMA is a portable, four-pound instrument that measures blood levels of oxygen, acidity, carbon dioxide, electrolytes and red blood cell volume much faster than competing systems requiring analysis to be done in the hospital laboratory.  \nThe SL version adds features not seen in older models.\nShares in Diametrics were up 3/8 at 5-1/4.\nOne year ago, Diametric shares traded as high as 12, but delays in delivering new products wrecked Wall Street forecasting models and the stock suffered.\nGiddings started with six-year-old Diametrics in April after a management shake-up prompted by the company's failure to move beyond the research and development phase.\nShortly after arriving, Giddings pushed through an 18- percent workforce cut and said Wednesday he would not rule out the possibility of further cuts, depending on results.\nThe Roseville, Minn.-based company's work force now numbers 174 people, down from 223.\n\"We have a goal of being profitable in the third quarter of 1998 and we will do what it takes to hit that objective in terms of our cost base,\" Giddings said.\n", "Canada's Barrick Gold Corp. appeared to regain the upper hand on Tuesday in the perplexing fight for control of the massive Busang gold find in Indonesia.\nBarrick said on Tuesday that a letter from the Indonesian government supported a proposed joint venture between Barrick and Bre-X Minerals Ltd., the Calgary, Alberta-based company that discovered Busang.\nBut the letter made plain that the government's blessing was conditional on satisfying the demands of Bre-X's Indonesian partners -- PT Askatindo Karya Mineral and PT Amsya Lyna -- within a month, Barrick said.\n\"The main thing here is that the government has reaffirmed its support of Barrick's participation,\" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg told Reuters. \"This is a very significant step forward.\"\nThe Indonesian government told Barrick and Bre-X last November to agree on a joint venture to develop Busang. The companies submitted a proposal to the government in December, asking for clarification on a few issues.\nHowever, delays in completing the agreement prompted Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc. to make a $5 billion counter-proposal for Bre-X last week. Under Placer's rival bid, 40 percent of Busang would go to Indonesian interests. The letter from the Indonesian government received this week by Barrick and Bre-X addressed only their joint venture proposal and mentioned nothing about the Placer Dome offer.\nBarrick gave little weight to Placer Dome's rival proposal after receiving the letter. \"I don't see how the Placer proposal can at all affect the progress we'll be making in reaching a final agreement,\" Borg said.\nPlacer was undaunted. \"We don't see it like that,\" Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver. \"We have a creative and compelling proposal on the table and we expect it will succeed.\"\nMeanwhile, Barrick said the Indonesian government had offered to help Bre-X sort out its relationships with its Indonesian partners and analysts believe Askatindo is the key to forging a successful deal between Barrick and Bre-X.\nAskatindo, which has a 10 percent stake in the richest parts of Busang, is controlled by the Syakareni family and Muhammad \"Bob\" Hasan, a close associate of Indonesian President Suharto. Hasan bought a 50 percent stake in Askatindo earlier this month.\n\"The Indonesian people are looking for a bigger participation,\" observed one Toronto-based gold mining analyst.\nOthers said Bre-X, Barrick and the Indonesian government were being pressured to work out a way to give Askatindo a larger share of Busang.\nIn its letter, the government stipulated that Barrick and its partners should get 67.5 percent of a new company that would develop Busang. Bre-X and its partners would keep 22.5 percent and the Indonesian government would get 10 percent.\nIt was unclear whether Askatindo's portion was included in Bre-X's 22.5 percent.\n\"That's what we have to work out with Bre-X and Askatindo,\" Borg said.\nBre-X officials did not return telephone calls asking for comment.\n", "The board of utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux, involved in merger talks with holding company Cie de Suez, was due to meet on Wednesday afternoon to approve the 1996 accounts, a company spokeswoman said.\nSuez and Lyonnaise are negotiating a merger which could put assets of the cash-rich holding company at the disposal of the utilities company with global ambitions.\nLyonnaise will publish its results on Thursday morning, which analysts expect to show net attributable profit of between 1.0 and 1.5 billion francs, after a 1995 profit of 906 million.\nBut more importantly, the market is hungry for details of the merger, specifically the financial terms and the industrial strategy, analysts said.\nThe boards have to address scepticism over whether there really is an industrial sense to the merger, or whether the deal is no more than a glorified capital increase for Lyonnaise through Suez, which owns a 16.8 percent stake in Lyonnaise.\nSome of the potential industrial integration may have been curtailed with undertakings that Suez's indirectly-held services subsidiary Tractebel will be kept independent in Belgium.\nAnd if this is to be a pure financial injection, a payment of a Suez special dividend to shareholders before any merger may erode that benefit.\n\"This is a major transaction. The objectives have to be clear,\" said an analyst. \"There has to be a clear strategy, there must be an industrial logic behind this link-up,\" he added.\nSo far the market has fed on rumours and speculation on a share swap of two Suez shares for every one Lyonnaise. Some analysts believe the merger makes sense in general terms, but want to know what the combined group would look like in detail.\n\"Does one plus one make one-and-a-half or two?\" asked the analyst. \"Vague talk of synergies is not enough.\"\nAnother analyst wanted to know how the operating units will be brought together, what subsidiaries will be sold and how the proceeds will be used to develop the group.\nLyonnaise has activities in water distribution, waste treatment, energy production, construction and communications.\nSuez has sold its Banque Indosuez investment bank and property assets to focus on providing services to local authorities, mainly held in its Tractebel unit.\nThe two groups have performed weakly throughout the nineties and have lacked a strategy, said the second analyst. The new combined company must show it has a direction and can provide a return to shareholders.\nInvestors in Suez stock have effectively lost a third of their money if they bought shares in 1987 when the company was privatised at 317 francs per share, he said.\nLyonnaise, saddled by a 1990 purchase of the Dumez construction group and property losses, has shown a poor return on equity of five or six percent, a rate bettered by an investment in bonds, he added.\nSuez stock was up 0.35 percent at 286.90 francs at 1100 GMT, while Lyonnaise was down 1.26 percent at 547 francs.\nSome of the questions being asked are, what will Suez do with units unrelated to services, like its Sofinco consumer credit house? Will Lyonnaise keep its loss-making construction firm GTM-Entrepose ?.\nHow fast will Suez pursue its disposal plan for financial assets and how will the cash be invested?\nSuez said on Tuesday it would pay an unspecified special dividend in June to reflect capital gains on the sale investment bank Banque Indosuez.\nA big Suez shareholder, the Saint-Gobain glass-making company, called on Tuesday for a 10 percent payment on Suez's financial assets estimated at a total 34 billion francs. Total Suez assets are estimated at 50 billion, including Tractebel.\nSuez said on Tuesday that its board was unanimously in favour of a merger with Lyonnaise. Both the Lyonnaise and Suez boards will have special meetings on April 11 to dicuss the terms of the merger.\n", "The world's biggest miner, RTZ-CRA, announced a major realignment of its sprawling empire on Wednesday and removed any doubt that London was its capital.\nThe group, born of a 1995 merger of London-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd, said it would now manage its global businesses along six main product lines.\nThese were aluminium, copper, energy, industrial minerals, iron ore, and gold and other minerals. Together they reaped revenues of around US$8 billion for the group in calendar 1996 from operations on all six continents.\nRTZ-CRA said it would shrink its Melbourne office, CRA's home base and until now the group's \"other\" headquarters. It will halve the staff there, shedding 100 jobs, and leave the office with a support role only. A total of 200 jobs will go worldwide.\nThe announcement provoked an angry response in parts of the Australian press. One newspaper said that CRA had been \"buried under the RTZ shake-up\".\nCRA chairman John Uhrig said that the merger, which maintained the two firms' separate listings, had so far not produced a better outcome for shareholders.\n\"It would have been surprising if it had in its first year of operation,\" Uhrig told a news conference in Melbourne.\nIn London, RTZ-CRA executive chairman Robert Wilson told reporters the group would take a one-off restructuring charge of US$40 million this year, and expected to gain annual cost savings of $50 million to $60 million by 1998.\nThe reorganisation leaves Australian-based executives to manage the aluminium, energy and iron ore businesses from Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. London handles the rest and remains the sole group headquarters.\nThe Salt Lake City office of its Kennecott copper operation in the United States as well as the group's Johannesburg office would be closed, the company said.\nThe new structure shifts the focus of management away from a geographical view of the world, where operations differ by country, toward a single management for each global business.\nIt ensures RTZ-CRA does not become an unwieldy bureaucracy unable to compete with more nimble rivals which deal in just one commodity, the group said.\n\"RTZ-CRA is a big company by the standards of the industry,\" executive chairman Wilson said. \"We are striving to obtain benefits of scale without the bureaucracy that goes very often with size.\"\nChief executive Leon Davis gave examples where, under the current structure, copper operations and coal mines were under several different leaderships across the globe.\n\"These are barriers that are artificially created and we are intent on removing them,\" Davis told the news conference.\n\"It will eliminate duplication, lower our costs and improve our efficiency,\" he added.\nMining analysts welcomed the move. One viewed it as confirmation the RTZ-CRA marriage, made without any shares actually changing hands, was effectively a cheap buy-out of CRA.\n\"If anyone thought the DLC (dual-listed structure) was anything other than a buy-out on the cheap, they should assess this little move because they are virtually wiping out Melbourne head office,\" a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters.\nThe analyst said he expected the group to eventually transform the dual-listed structure into the one company, although in London Wilson denied that the changes would undermine the dual-structure.\nRTZ-CRA has already proposed to ditch its double-barrelled name and become known, subject to shareholder approval this year, as Rio Tinto. RTZ's shares would then trade in London as Rio Tinto Plc and CRA's stock in Australia as Rio Tinto Ltd.\nA Melbourne-based analyst said the cementing of London as the group's headquarters came as no surprise. \"It doesn't make any sense to have two head offices,\" he said.\n", "Pinning down the size of Russia's grain harvest is proving a problem for analysts and traders due to widely differing estimates from official and trade groups.\nVarious government and private-sector predictions put Russia's net grain output at anywhere from 70 to 80 million tonnes -- a range which could leave Moscow with one of its worst harvests ever or give it a more comfortable margin.\n\"The situation is still tense and serious,\" said independent agriculture specialist Andrei Sizov of SovEcon Ltd consultancy on Friday, citing miniscule stocks from last year's harvest.  \nBut Arkady Zlochevsky, president of the OGO grain and food trading company, one of Russia's largest, saw net grain output at 80 million tonnes. \"We are not optimists, we are realists -- we know how much peasants and regional administrations water down the real figures,\" he said.\nThe various numbers see output recovering anywhere from 11 to 21 percent from last year's drought-hit 63.4 million tonnes.\nAgriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun said in June, his last public forecast, that he saw output at 70 million tonnes, while Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha, who is in charge of the harvest, put the figure this week at 75-77 million tonnes.  \nIn a separate estimate, the state statistics committee sees output at 71-72 million tonnes.\nSizov said he saw net output at 70 million tonnes.\nA Russian source at a Western industry organisation put it at 74-75 million tonnes, based on recent talks with other trade sources in Moscow and abroad. \"These are the figures we've got right now,\" the source said. \"I think they're realistic.\"\nThe state meteorological service, which bases its forecasts on weather conditions only, and not on factors like tractor availability, sees output in the 71-75 million tonne range.  \nThe International Grains Council sees the crucial Russian wheat harvest alone rising to 34 million tonnes, while Zlochevksy sees 37 million tonnes.\nThe lower-range net output numbers still mean the 1996 harvest could be one of the worst three since 1965.\nThe Russian government will not issue a final figure until at least the first two weeks of October, when the harvest officially ends -- leaving trade sources now to watch the all-important Siberian harvest, key to regional supplies.  \n\"The harvest in the European part of Russia is nearly over and pretty much a known entity -- the focus right now is Western and Eastern Siberia,\" Sizov said.\nIn Siberia, farmers are battling weeks of rains that have moved the harvest closer to the date of the first snow, which can come as early as the end of the month.\n\"I think they could lose three or four million tonnes there,\" due to the weather, one trade source said. --Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520\n", "Canadians are experiencing a winter of dismay as their national religion -- ice hockey -- is shaken by sex scandals, fraud trials and the decline of their once dominant teams.\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of Canada's greatest triumph on ice -- a last-minute victory in a series against the Soviet Union that whipped this placid country into a patriotic frenzy.\n\"It was the one time that we were distinctly Canadian,\" Paul Henderson, a journeyman player who achieved hockey sainthood for scoring the winning goal in the final game of the 1972 Summit Series, said in a recent interview.\nBut memories of past glory are tempered by fears that Canada is losing its grip on the game.\nThe current season began with the faith-shattering defeat of Canada by the United States in the final of the inaugural World Cup of Hockey.\nAnd computer-enhanced pucks that leave bizarre colour trails on television screens, and the NHL's expansion into U.S. markets with little hockey tradition have left purists cringing at the Americanisation of their game.\nThe most disturbing recent blow has been a sex scandal involving young boys and Canada's oldest hockey shrine -- Maple Leaf Gardens, home of the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nCanadian police have charged two Gardens' employees after uncovering a pedophile ring that allegedly lured teenaged boys to the arena with free tickets and autographs of their hockey heroes.\nThe sordid tale, which may involve up to 60 victims between the late 1960s and early 1990s, has grabbed newspaper headlines across the country.\n\"Maple Leaf Gardens was a sex haven of abused boys, tons of them. They would lay down blankets and they would get us naked and have group sex,\" one victim, 34-year-old Martin Kruze, has said of the abuse he says started when he was 13.\nIt's not the only sex abuse case to rock hockey this year.\nGraham James, one of Canada's top junior coaches, pleaded guilty in January to sexually assaulting two players in the 1980s and was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison.\nJames admitted to more than 300 instances of sexual assault over six years against Boston Bruins player Sheldon Kennedy, who was 14 when the assaults began in 1984.\nSince the James case broke, a minor league hockey coach in Calgary was charged with sexually assaulting a player at a summer camp, and a community club hockey coach in Winnipeg, was suspended after a former player alleged sexual abuse.\nThe revelations hit hard in a nation where it is traditional for parents of boys with pro hockey aspirations to turn their chidren over to the care of junior coaches, often far from home.\n\"The sex cases have made Canadians very uneasy. It speaks directly to this power relationship between adult coaches and the children in hockey,\" University of Toronto psychologist John Ferudy said.\nOther criminal cases have also vied for space in the country's sports pages this winter.\nFormer hockey czar and player agent Alan Eagleson, architect of the 1972 matchup between Canada and the Soviet Union, faces fraud and theft charges related to the billing of clients and handling of funds from international tournaments.\nThe game's reputation for thuggery reared its ugly head again with a junior league brawl last month. Police in Halifax, Nova Scotia said criminal charges could soon come against a player who repeatedly punched an unconscious opponent who lay convulsing on the ice.\nCanada's junior teams still dominate international tournaments, but critics argue their success is due more to a grinding physical style of play than to superior skills.\nThe influx of flashy Europeans into the NHL has also caused some concern in the game's homeland. Canadians now account for just 60 percent of NHL players, down from 76 percent a decade ago and 98 percent in 1968, and a Canadian has not led NHL rookies in scoring since 1988.\nMeanwhile, the future of Canada's small-market clubs looks grim.\nWith the departure of the Winnipeg and Quebec teams to Phoenix and Denver, only six of the NHL's 26 clubs remain in Canada -- and all but one has a losing record this season.\nTo add further insult, the league's current expansion plans are focused far from hockey's roots in small frozen towns across Canada. Last week, Hamilton, Ontario's bid for an NHL franchise was rejected, while steamy Atlanta appears hot favourite to get the next NHL team.\n\"It's a slap not just in Hamilton's face, but in the face of all Canadians,\" said Hamilton bid organiser Gabe Macaluso.\nCalgary, Edmonton and Ottawa are struggling to stay alive amid soaring costs.\nThe Ottawa Senators have warned fans to buy more tickets or face losing the team.\nThe Edmonton Oilers, who won five Stanley Cups in the 1980s before selling off their best players, plan to offer shares to the public this spring. \"I'm doing this to keep the team here,\" Oilers' owner Peter Pocklington said.\nBut this supposed effort on behalf of Edmonton will never buy Pocklington's way into hockey heaven.\nHe will forever be loathed for shipping Canadian national treasure Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles.\n", "A debt deal to refinance Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA /Plc may help management and bank lenders but leaves little value for the long-suffering shareholders, debt specialists said on Thursday.\nEurotunnel said on Thursday it would send prospectuses to shareholders next month giving details of a restructuring of its 70 billion francs ($12 billion) of bank debt and hoped to get approvals at a meeting in Paris by July 10.\nIt earlier announced a 1996 net loss of 6.1 billion francs, one billion francs less than a year ago.\nOne debt specialist said Eurotunnel technically has no shareholder value as its debts wiped out its \"enterprise value.\"\nEurotunnel currently has issued shareholders capital of some 10 billion pounds, which it plans to halve to take into account its past losses. But the debt stock will remain intact, except for one billion pounds which will be swapped for shares.\nA second debt expert said the complex debt deal takes none of the debt away but pushed out payments further into the future, giving time for management to stabilise the company.\n\"The restructuring works in that it solves the banks' problems by turning current debt into future potential paid debt,\" he said. \"It solves the company's problem as it allows management to continue without defaulting,\" he added.\nBut the problem for shareholders is the deal \"mops up all the free cashflow for the short, medium and long-term,\" he said. There is no debt write-off and the loans will be simply restructured, using instruments which extend maturities, allow extra borrowing and rolling up interest payments. However, interest margins will be lowered.\n\"The restructuring may leave shareholders with 50 percent of the company but 50 percent of nothing is still nothing,\" he said. \"Based on common-sense projections, it is hard to see how the equity holders are going to get anything,\" he said.\nThe debt/equity swap will leave equity holders with 55 percent of Eurotunnel's capital.\nBut first Eurotunnel must get approvals from both its 225-strong bank loan syndicate and shareholders.\nChristian Cambier, chairman of the Eurotunnel shareholders association, said he has four conditions for approving the deal and would be seeking shareholder proxies to get a 34 percent blocking vote at the July meeting.\nThe conditions are: he wants the banks to approve the restructuring deal before the shareholders give their approval, both tunnel bores to be operating by May 15, freight service on the Shuttle to be resumed before June 15 and an extension of the tunnel concession by the French and British governments.\n\"I am confident we will refuse approval if the conditions are not met,\" he said. Cambier's association held proxies for 32 percent of the shareholder votes at last year's annual shareholders' meeting.\nEurotunnel is running a reduced service following a major fire on November 18 which forced the shut-down of part of the \"south\" tunnel bore and halted the freight Shuttle operation.\nAnother group representing Eurotunnel small shareholders, Adacte, said in a statement it maintained its opposition to the restructuring which it said gives too much to the banks and exclusively hit the shareholders by diluting the capital.\nAdacte wants to postpone the shareholders meeting until the company can show a full year of continuous commercial service.\nEurotunnel has not published its cashflow forecasts to show these will cover debt service and capital expenditure needs. Although shareholders get no rights to the cashflow, they are being asked to approve a deal which dilutes their holdings.\n\"Last year's shareholders meeting was a rehearsal,\" said Sophie L'Helias, a laywer who helped organise the proxy solicitation for the 1996 shareholders meeting. \"This year it is the real thing. Shareholders will have to decide what is in their best interests,\" she added.\nThe second of the debt specialists said a rejection of the debt accord would lead to bankruptcy, which was not attractive but could leave it to a commercial court to decide whether some of the debt should be written off.

Official forecasts put direct foreign investment in China in 1997 at $49.5 billion, up 15 percent from last year.\nChina's exports in January 1997 rose 27.5 percent to $11.69 billion while imports fell 1.29 percent to $9.98 billion, creating a trade surplus of US$1.71 billion against a deficit of $938 million in January 1996, customs figures showed.\nDealers said the average export cost of foreign exchange stood at around 8.38 yuan for each dollar of exported goods in 1996, making exporters lose money when they turn trade surplus dollars into local currency at the current exchange rate.\n\"If the exchange rate rises further, exporters will lose more, which is a key factor for curbing the yuan's rise,\" said one dealer.\n", "Franco-Italian semiconductor group SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV said on Wednesday 1996 earnings rose 19 percent to $625.5 million, but issued a warning on the first quarter of 1997 after a weak end to last year.\nA 15.5 percent fourth quarter drop to $142 million contrasted with a near-doubling of Intel Corp's profit in the same period. The U.S. company's report on January 14 had boosted SGS-Thomson shares on bullish expectations.\nSGS-Thomson's president and chief executive Pasquale Pistorio said he was pleased with the 1996 performance. But he was cautious about the first quarter of 1997, although he said the company would still outperform the industry average.\n\"With lead times shrinking throughout the industry, we are entering the first quarter of 1997 with less order visibility than we have historically enjoyed,\" he said in a statement.\n\"From what we know today, we expect 1997 first quarter revenues to be close to third quarter 1996 levels. We also anticipate that overall pricing pressures will continue, and therefore, in spite of productivity improvements, gross margins could be slightly below fourth quarter 1996 levels,\" he added.\nIn the third quarter of 1996, net revenues were $988.4 million.\n\"While first quarter conditions continue to be uncertain, we believe that subsequent quarters of 1997 will show progressive improvement compared to the 1997 first quarter as the company continues to emphasise differentiated products and high growth applications,\" Pistorio added.\n\"Recent contracts with key customers and new design wins in such high growth areas as hard disk drives, set-top boxes and digital cellular phones give us confidence that SGS-Thomson will continue to outperform the industry average in 1997,\" he said.\nSGS-Thomson, whose shares are listed in Paris and New York, is 70 percent-owned by two consortia, one French and one Italian, reflecting its formation in a merger of a French and Italian microchip company.\nPistorio said the 1996 results were achieved in difficult market conditions.\nPrices of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) have plunged and caused losses at many chipmakers. SGS-Thomson, however, does not make DRAMs but dedicated chips which shielded it somewhat from price erosion.\n\"Our concentration on differentiated products provided consistency to our financial results throughout a period that was characterised by industry-wide volatility,\" Pistorio said.\nFull year revenues rose to $4.12 billion from $3.55 billion. Capital expenditure rose to $1.12 billion from $1.0 billion and research and development spending was up by 21 percent to $532.30 million, or 12.9 percent of sales.\nThe Le Monde newspaper recently said that French Industry Minister Franck Borotra wanted to reduce the French stake in the company, which is held by France Telecom, CEA-Industrie and Thomson-CSF.\nThe Industry Ministry has no official comment.\n", "Food and drink group Grand Metropolitan Plc said on Thursday it was hanging a \"for sale\" sign on its national food businesess in Europe in an effort to focus on its major international brands -- Pillsbury, Green Giant, Haagen-Dazs and Old El Paso.\n\"We have people indicating strong interest and indicating prices that are acceptable to us,\" said Paul Walsh, chief executive of GrandMet's Pillsbury Company in an interview.\nHe said he expected the sell-off to be complete by January 1997.\nIn the shop window in Britain are Shippams, meat pie maker Peter's Savoury Products, Memory Lane Cakes and Fleur de Lys.\nAlso on the block are Germany's Hofmann-Menu and Goldstein, cake and pastry maker Brossard in France and Italy, waffle maker Suzy and biscuit firm Desobry in Belgium and cake maker Driehoek in the Netherlands.\nAnalysts expect them to fetch about 140 million pounds ($220 million).\nTheir combined sales last year were 370 million pounds with operating profit of 10 million and operating capital used of 129 million pounds at September 30, 1995.\nBefore the announcement, GrandMet's European foods business showed sales of $1.2 billion, which are forecast to fall to about $450 million once they are sold.\nThe European foods business posted a trading profit of 23 million pounds in the year to September 1995, up from 12 million in 1994, after a hefty restructuring and plant closure programme undertaken in 1993.\nThe company does not disclose earnings for each individual subsidiary but Brossard in France is easily the largest and similar in sales terms to Germany's Erasco Group, which Campbell Soup agreed earlier to buy from GrandMet for about $210 million.\n\"My plan in foods is to focus on our leading brands,\" said Walsh, adding that the sell-off of so-called tertiary brands would allow GrandMet to concentrate on its main brands.\nThe businesses were also providing an inadequate return on capital, he said. \"You can expect GrandMet to be very eager to improve total return to shareholders. Several of us have held this view for a long while.\n\"I think it's compatible with GrandMet's mission to improve shareholder returns. We intend to fix that.\"\nGrandMet shares were steady at 469 pence.\n($1=.6373 Pound)\n", "Shares in Crown Ltd, Australia's most successful casino tumbled on Friday as nervous investors cashed in their chips weeks before the company opens the nation's biggest casino complex aimed at Asian gamblers.\nCrown shares closed at a 16-month low, completing a rapid 27 percent slide from grace since mid-January when concerns about rising costs and delays at the A$1.55 billion (US$1.23 billion) complex began to shake confidence in the company.\nCrown, which plans to move into its new riverside home in Melbourne in April, has also raised investors' eyebrows with its lavish attempts to attract the region's biggest gamblers.\nIt uses private jets to bring its best customers into the country and also plans to buy a private golf course, estimated to be worth about A$40 million, for their exclusive use.\nIn addition, it is negotiating to buy the management rights to its own casino from major shareholder Hudson Conway Ltd for an estimated A$300 million. Crown owns the casino but Hudson manages it for a fee.\nTo fund its ambitions, Crown has raised over A$500 million in equity and debt since August. On Thursday, it announced a rights issue of shares, spooking investors further.\n\"It's just the continued raising of capital. People are now at the stage where they really do not believe perhaps that this is the last one,\" a casino industry analyst told Reuters.\nInvestors are also uncertain about its Asian strategy. \"People have no understanding how big that market is and how much of that market Crown will be able to attract ...,\" she said.\nThe company's profit outlook was downgraded in an independent accountant's report which came to light last month.\nBut Crown has said its earnings outlook remains bright and denied on Friday its new complex had run into big cost overruns.\nThe total estimated cost of the project has risen to A$1.55 billion from the company's December estimate of A$1.25 billion.\n\"There's obviously been additional expenditure on plant, property and equipment, but we are fairly happy with that level of expenditure,\" Crown spokesman Gary O'Neill told Reuters.\nCrown has pinned most of its hopes on Asian gamblers, who account for about one-third of the firm's revenues. Crown hopes to take this to over 60 percent after opening its new complex, which it says is being fitted out with Asian tastes in mind.\nBut the impending opening has coincided with a backlash against Australia's gamble on the casino industry, both by investors as well as political, community and business leaders.\nAustralia now boasts 14 casinos.\nInvestors see the industry as saturated while other businesses, especially retailing chains, regard it as a threat to their own slice of the consumer dollar.\nPrime Minister John Howard also stepped into the debate this month, ordering an investigation into the levels of gambling after official figures showed A$1 in every A$200 spent by Australians ended up on casino tables.\nHe said gambling threatened to become a \"national blight\". \"I think ... we're at saturation level as far as gambling facilities in Australia are concerned,\" Howard said.\n(A$1 = US$0.79)\n", "Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party on Thursday welcomed a pledge from the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, that people would keep their basic freedoms after China takes over on July 1.\nBut some activists staged a noisy protest disrupting a meeting staged by Tung's aides to tap the public's views on his controversial plan to whittle down civil liberties.\nA new opinion poll, meanwhile, indicated nine in 10 of Hong Kong students do not believe China will really allow the territory its promised autonomy after Britain hands it back.\nFears have been rising in Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years and now with 6.4 million people, that the territory will suffer a loss of freedom after the handover.\nTung on Wednesday vigorously defended proposed curbs on the right to demonstrate and on foreign funding of political groups, saying laws in the United States were much tougher.\n\"The majority of cities in North America, including New York, Washington and San Francisco, all require police permission before demonstrations can be held,\" he said.\n\"Let me assure you the (future) government has the strongest determination to preserve the freedoms that the people of Hong Kong currently enjoy,\" Tung said in a dinner speech.\n\"Peaceful and lawful demonstrations can and must be allowed to continue. I see public demonstration as a way for people to express their views, and public demonstrations are now a part of Hong Kong culture,\" he said.\nAnthony Cheung, vice president of the Democratic Party cautiously welcomed Tung's assurances, the first public comment Tung has made on the proposals launched last week.\n\"We welcome this pledge that the right to protest, the right to demonstrate, the freedom of assembly and association, all of these are people's rights and should be part of Hong Kong's political culture,\" Cheung told Hong Kong radio.\n\"But we question a lot of the substance of Mr Tung's proposals on how to amend the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance,\" he said. \"Some of these proposals have in fact infringed the rights that Mr Tung was talking about.\"\nAbout 16 pro-democracy councillors waved banners and shouted slogans, disrupting a public consultation on the plan at Hong Kong's Space Museum on Thursday.

Wednesday threw down the gauntlet to AT&amp;T Corp. by offering a nationwide long distance calling plan that is one cent cheaper than the industry giant's own flat-rate plan.\nThe flat rate plan is called \"GTE's One Easy Rate,\" charging 14 cents a minute day or night. It has no monthly or enrollment fee and is immediately available to consumers in 27 states where GTE already offers either local calling or wireless services as well as long distance.\nThe Stamford, CT.-based company may later expand the plan to the other 23 states where it offers only long distance services.\nThough several companies have cheaper off-peak calling rates, GTE said its rate compares favourably with flat rate plans offered by the big three.\nAT&amp;T charges 15 cents per minute for its One Rate, MCI Communications Corp. 14.5 cents for its True Rate, and Sprint Corp. 15 cents for its Sense Day plan.\nGTE last month unveiled a flat-rate calling plan for businesses that included domestic and international calling.\nGTE's existing long distance rates are 27 cents a minute during peak hours and 14 cents off peak, with a 10 percent discount for customers who spend more than $10 per month and 25 percent off for those who spend $25 or more.\nGTE entered the long distance business in March 1996 and signed up 800,000 customers by the end of the year, 50,000 more than it predicted in November.\nAnalysts say it and other smaller new entrants have hit AT&amp;T hard in its core residential customer base. MCI and Sprint are less reliant on residential customers.\nGTE is predominantly a local telephone company, and is often compared with the Baby Bells. But unlike them, it is not restricted by the 1996 Telecommunications Act.\nThe law forces the Baby Bells to open their local calling regions to competition before offering long distance calling to their local customers.\nAnalysts say this ruling has been a boon for GTE, giving it a headstart of more than a year over the Bells in the $80 billion long distance market.\nGTE said it also plans to focus on markets for ethnic minorities. It may bundle international calling to the country of origin with multilingual customer service and other services needed in that community marketplace.\n", "China on Thursday hinted at ethnic unrest in Moslem Xinjiang as a senior official called for unity in the western region that was rocked by separatist bomb attacks last week.\n\"Xinjiang ...must further improve ethnic unity, protect social stability and do a better job of building up Xinjiang,\" the official People's Daily quoted Vice-Premier Li Lanqing as saying.\nLi made no direct reference to the series of deadly bombings in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi on February 25, the day Beijing held funeral rites for late leader Deng Xiaoping.\nThe Chinese vice premier's remarks to Xinjiang delegates at the National People's Congress, or parliament, were one of the few signs in the national media that the region had once again been shaken by ethnic unrest.\nChinese police have arrested at least 20 ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi and Yining near Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan, exiled Uighur nationalists said from the Kazakh capital of Almaty.\n\"At least 20 ethnic Uighurs have been arrested...but the real number may be even higher because we have no information whether new arrests took place last night,\" Kakharman Khozhamberdi, head of a local Uighur association, told Reuters in Almaty.\nOfficials and residents in Urumqi and Yining, contacted by telephone from Beijing, were unaware of the total number of people arrested in the attacks.\nThree bombs hidden on public buses blew up within minutes of each other in Urumqi on February 25 in an apparently coordinated attack.

Sales rose 2.5 percent to A$3.97 billion for the fiscal half-year, with A$2.03 billion coming from its domestic operations.\nOverall passenger revenue was flat, with revenue falling in its North American, Japanese, and other Asian markets.\nRevenue from Japan fell about 30 percent to A$315 million in the first half. Qantas did not expect the contribution from the Japanese market to improve in the second half.\n\"It won't improve significantly,\" finance director Gary Toomey told reporters.\n\"Major changes in the Japanese market resulted in virtually no net contribution. This is a sharp contrast to the situation three years ago when the Japan route accounted for the bulk of Qantas international profits,\" Pemberton said in a statement.\n\"There is fundamental change occuring in distribution in the travel industry in Japan. It is becoming less structured, there is more competitive pricing,\" Qantas managing director James Strong told reporters.\n\"The economic situation is not very buoyant in Japan, the currency has been very strong, so it is a combination of all of those factors,\" Strong said.\nYield, a measure of revenue to the number of passengers, was likely to remain lower than in previous years due to the structural change in the Japanese tourism market, Pemberton told Reuters after the news conference.\nAustralia's share of Japan's tourism market has fallen by half a percent to 4.9 percent between the 1993/94 and 1995/96 fiscal years, even though more Japanese go on overseas holidays. Group revenues were not expected to grow quickly, fuel prices were forecast to remain high and price competition was expected to continue in most markets, Qantas said.\n\"The outlook is therefore for relatively modest fleet expansion and an undiminished drive for efficiency improvements and cost reductions to increase profits,\" it said.\nThe first half result was also hit by higher fuel prices. Qantas had absorbed increases of over A$50 million, net of hedging gains. At constant fuel prices, operating profit before tax would be up over 21 percent on a year earlier, it said.\n\"Looking beyond 1996/97, the airline will continue to expand, but at a slower rate than the very high levels of the last three years,\" Pemberton said.\n(A$1=US$.7860)\n", "Chinese authorities have closed down 12 illegal compact disc production lines in just two weeks, but Beijing still has far to go to conquer the nation's army of copyright pirates, officials and analysts said on Thursday.\nTough action to curb theft of intellectual property rights had netted more than 10 million counterfeit products in 1996 and had won recognition even in Washington, which in June took China to the brink of trade war over the issue, officials said.\nOfficials in booming southern Guangdong province had shut down 12 music and video disc production lines since December 10 as part of a national crackdown on pornography and piracy, said Wang Ziqiang of the National Copyright Administration of China.\n\"We have uncovered quite a few pirate production lines...

Beijing says it has moved faster than any other developing nation to clamp down on the underground industry.\nWhile China was moving in the right direction on intellectual property, the efforts of the last year appeared to have had little lasting effect on the roaring retail market in pirated goods, said one Western industry consultant.\nBlockbuster Hollywood movies were readily available on pirated video discs for as little 20-30 yuan ($2.40-3.60) per film despite the high-profile national crackdown, said the consultant, who declined to be named.\n\"There are lots of places to buy discs,\" he said. \"They are periodically raided, but afterwards the show goes on.\nPirate producers often had connections with local officials, making anything more than a cosmetic crackdown a potential battle of political wills between the central government and increasingly autonomous local authorities, he said.\nCopyright official Wang said piracy was a problem found in most countries and was not something that could be eliminated by just a few years of tough action.\n\"The key point is the government's attitude to the problem,\" Wang said, adding that U.S. attitudes to China's copyright problems were far from even-handed.\n\"The (copyright) situation in some other countries is worse than here, but I don't think the United States is as strict with them,\" he said.\nOfficials have said Beijing plans to launch video rental counters in post offices as a way of curbing private rental shops that often offer cut-price pirate videos for hire.\n($1=8.3 yuan)\n", "ReliaStar Financial Corp chairman John Turner said Monday his company's $488 million merger deal with Security-Connecticut Corp would broaden the insurance products sold by both firms.\n\"We identified Security-Connecticut as a company that was positioned in the market with both product lines and distribution that fit very well with ours.

That, Sergeant said, opens the potential for an upgrade by ratings agencies.\nTurner said the Security-Connecticut deal fits its criterion of a 16 percent return on equity and will not derail its goal of a 13 percent increase in earnings per share.\n\"What we say is we intend to attain (these goals) without acquisitions, but we also readily recognize that consolidation is occurring in our industry,\" he added.\nAfter the Security-Connecticut deal, ReliaStar would become the 11th largest publicly held life insurance holding company in the United States.\n((Reuters Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))\n", "China's decision to dramatically expand the number of companies listed on its B shares markets will help to finally make them a serious prospect for foreign investors, brokers said on Wednesday.\nThe securities authorities on Tuesday unveiled a list of 33 companies given approval to offer foreign currency B shares and list them on the two domestic stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\nLast month, the authorities also named 38 companies for listing on overseas stock markets, most of which are expected to be listed as H shares in Hong Kong.\n\"They won't be able to list them all by the end of 1997, the volume is just too big,\" said Hoong Yik Luen of ING-Barings in Shanghai.\n\"But by mid-1998 if all goes well, the market capitalisation for B and H shares will be doubled or even tripled.

This IS the dress of our society,\" said one normally casual Czech reporter.\nLiberated by the bloodless 1989 coup led by the sweatered dissident playwright Vaclav Havel and other crumpled intellectuals, much of Prague's free press has carried on the no-holds-barred approach to many high-brow functions.\nGovernment and presidential news conferences are often festooned with jeans, rock concert t-shirts and pullovers, but an increasing number of business suits have recently snuck in.\nWhen Havel made the unlikely ascent from prisoner to president in 1989, an emergency tailor was dispatched to complete his first suit so he could take the oath of office.\nBut as the years roll on, Havel, who once rode a child's scooter through Prague Castle's Baroque halls, has developed a taste for finer suits and the trappings of protocol.\n\"These rules are respected by all workers and guests; there's nothing preventing journalists also from coming to actions organised by our offices in society dress,\" Monday's statement said.\nBut the times are not changing so quickly.\nDespite having a dapper prime minister, Vaclav Klaus, who routinely wins opinion polls as best dressed in Bohemia, many of Prague's most well-respected democrats do not associate a free market and a free society with a rigid dress code.\nAt a reception on the 20th anniversary of the Charter 77 human rights declaration earlier this month, dissidents, reporters, and ministers mixed in Prague Castle's gilded Spanish Hall, the most formal of the country's salons.\nAmid the mirrors, porcelain, and stucco of the magnificent room, guests rocked the night away in everything from waistcoats to the best picks of garage sale bins.\nAnd while actors dressed in former communist police uniforms symbolically kept an eye on the event, the real interior minister's rat tail hairdo belied his new establishment suit.\n", "A 22 percent rise in fee and other non-interest income boosted Westpac Banking Corp Ltd to a surprisingly strong first half profit result on Wednesday, more than offsetting the effect of a squeeze on interest margins.\nWestpac announced a net profit of A$638 million for the six months to March 31, up from A$565 million in the same period a year earlier.  \nAnalysts said this was about A$20 million to A$30 million above their expectations, but had not shocked those in the market who had pushed Westpac's share price higher in recent weeks in anticipation of very strong result.\n\"That's why the stock hasn't bounced as much as you'd expect it to,\" Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said.\nWestpac's shares were down five cents at A$7.45 at 3.40 p.m. (0540 GMT), having earlier jumped to a A$7.60 high.  \nThe profit jump was due largely to non-interest income rising to A$869 million from A$714 million, underpinned by rising account fees and some profits from the sale of property and closed branches.\nThe boost from fees more than offset sluggish growth in interest income as Westpac, like Australia's other major banks, battled a 150 basis point squeeze in home lending margins.\nWestpac's group net interest margin fell to 3.55 percent in the six months to March 31 from 3.75 percent in the six months to September.  \nNon-bank competitors funded by mortgage origination have snared more than 10 percent of the home mortgage market in the past three years, forcing banks to cut their home loan margins by about 150 basis points to about 100 to 150 basis points.\n\"Features of the first half financial results were non-interest expense control, continued improvement in asset quality, improved staff productivity, and higher non-interest income reflecting: growth in commissions and fees, higher financial markets income and benefits from the sale of equity investments,\" Westpac managing director Bob Joss said in a statement.  \n\"These results were achieved against a background of reduced interest margins and continued investments in strategic capabilities designed to enhance future prospects,\" Joss said.\nWestpac's net interest income fell to A$1.695 billion in the six months ended March 31 from A$1.705 billion in the six months to September 30 last year, but was up on the A$1.549 billion in the year-ago period.\nIncome from fees and commissions rose to A$592 million from A$532 million in the year-ago first half.\nOther income, which included the sale of equity investments, rose to A$142 million from A$68 million a year earlier.  \nWestpac also announced it planned to raise up to A$500 million through a preference share issue after its merger with Bank of Melbourne Ltd.\nWestpac said it would issue up to 20 million non-cumulative converting preference share at an issue price of A$25 each.

Monday launched a new effort to derail a planned $9.1 billion merger between Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp., proposing to buy a stake in Conrail even though its takeover offer has been rejected.\nThe Norfolk, Va.-based railroad said it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail stock for $115 per share if investors defeat a key provision that would allow the proposed Conrail-CSX union to move forward. Norfolk Southern made its offer in a direct appeal to Conrail shareholders, many of whom are unhappy with the proposed Conrail-CSX transaction.\nConrail shareholders are scheduled to vote on the provision Friday at a special meeting in Philadelphia.\nPhiladelphia-based Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion cash offer, saying that the $9.1 billion cash and stock transaction with CSX provides more strategic benefits.\nConrail is asking shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law that effectively requires CSX, which already owns 19.9 percent of Conrail shares, to pay $110 per share in cash for the rest.\nIf shareholders waive that provision, Richmond, Va.-based CSX will buy another 20 percent of Conrail shares for $110 per share and acquire the rest of Conrail in stock.\nNorfolk Southern asked shareholders to reject the measure, saying it would amend its existing all-cash offer in order to buy about 8.2 million Conrail shares. The purchase of the shares would represent the maximum number of shares that Norfolk Southern can buy without triggering Conrail's \"poison pill\" anti-takeover defence plan.\nOnce completed, Norfolk Southern would then begin a second offer for all remaining Conrail shares.\nNorfolk Southern said the 9.9 percent offer would not be subject to termination of the merger agreement between Conrail and CSX and would not require any action by Conrail's board.\n\"Conrail shareholders have an opportunity to reassert control over their corporation and reject the coercive tactics being used to pressure them into approving CSX's inferior offer,\" Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode said in a statement.\nOfficials from Conrail and CSX could not immediately be reached for comment.\nNorfolk Southern announced its plan after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nIt also said a vote to reject the CSX/Conrail measure would signal the beginning of the process to unseat Conrail directors at Conrail's next annual meeting.\n", "Czech railway unions said on Monday they would begin a nationwide strike at midnight demanding a complete overhaul of the decrepit rail system, and adding to growing unrest among public sector workers.\nThe planned 48-hour strike, seeking a long-term plan to revive the failing state railways, is expected to completely shut passenger and freight traffic on domestic and international lines throughout the Czech Republic.\n\"We certainly will strike from midnight,\" the executive secretary of the Association of Unions of Rail Workers (OSZ), Zdenek Jilek, told Reuters.\nIn a statement, the OSZ said that if it did not get sufficient guarantees to repair what it says are massive problems in the quality and development of the state railways Ceske Drahy, it would prolong the strike.\n\"It will be repeated every 24 hours,\" the OSZ said.\nPrime Minister Vaclav Klaus was quoted by the CTK news agency as saying on Monday that a new development plan for the railways had already been negotiated with union leaders, and the unions were simply impatient for a result.\n\"If they could not hold on until when we meet again, and they call a strike, then they are taking a great risk in front of 10 million people of this country,\" he was quoted as saying.\nThe action comes on top of an alternating \"chain\" strike started last week by teachers and school workers who are forcing the closure each day of selected primary and secondary schools throughout the country.\nThe school strikes, for pay increases and more state expenditure on teaching resources, are alternating each day among various districts.\nThere have also been persistent threats of industrial action by doctors and health-care workers, especially at large state clinics and hospitals which have fallen into insolvency.\nThe centre-right coalition government has resisted giving into public sector demands which might threaten its fiscally-hawkish reputation.\nThe country posted its first state budget deficit in 1996, at just over a billion crowns, after three straight years with a budget surplus.\nThe rail union leaders said that their action carries no demands for pay increases, but is rather to clean up what it says are \"massive problems\" in the leadership of Ceske Drahy and the transport policy of the Czech government.\nThey said that the condition of the rail system was \"critical\" and problems were deepening, and that the government had not fulfilled its own decisions to improve and consolidate the railways.\nThe OSZ represents all Czech rail workers, which total more than 100,000 employess, excluding train drivers who have yet to say whether they will support the action.\nIt is not expected that the railways would function even if the drivers do not strike.\nLosses of Ceske Drahy, one of the few companies not yet privatised by the post-Communist government, have been mounting.\nCTK quoted Ceske Drahy officials as saying the company expected losses of about seven billion crowns in 1997 after a six billion crown loss last year, and four billion in 1995.\nIn June 1995, the rail unions were hours away from a strike over the planned privatisation of Ceske Drahy, when the government agreed not to execute its plan at the time to restructure the loss-making railways.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "TNT Express Worldwide is to double the number of staff it employs in China and open five new branches within the next year, general manager for Hong Kong Bryan Chan told Reuters.\nThe express freight firm said it has also applied for full landing rights at Shanghai and Xiamen to extend its dedicated Asian Air Express freighter service. TNT uses two British Aerospace 146 and a Boeing 727 freighter in an overnight delivery service between Manila, Hong Kong, Singapore, Jakarta, Taipei and Seoul. Industry observers point out that it took TNT five years to gain rights for the six existing destinations, so permission for the Chinese destinations is expected to be a slow process.\n\"We realise it may take time but Shanghai is a very good point to connect to the Philippines and gives us more options to eventually allow us to close the loop in our Asian network,\" Chan said in an interview.\nHe said a main task for Eric Wong, newly appointed general sales manager for Hong Kong, will be to promote expansion of the air network.\nTNT currently has nine China branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, Shenzhen, Qingdao, Nnnjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou in a joint venture with the state monopoly Sinotrans Group.

Protect freedom of association,\" they shouted. \"Human rights cannot be infringed upon.\"\nA handful wore tall hats and hung labels around their necks, harking back to the Cultural Revolution when those who were politically persecuted were forced to wear dunce caps and hang boards around their necks with their names crossed out.

The two countries have signed an agreement to form a joint military battalion and new Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea is to make his first official trip abroad to Budapest this week. Constantinescu said Romania, after a slow start in post-Communist reforms, now met NATO's membership criteria on democracy and human rights.\n\"There is no argument against Romania's integration into NATO. Anything regarding democratic steps, stability, minority relations, relations with neighbouring countries and regional stability, Romania has fulfilled,\" Constantinescu said.\nBut the president said that \"radical\" economic reforms were still necessary, and his country could not rely on large NATO members to pay the bill for modernising Romania's army.\n\"It's clear that the United States... are not willing to support the costs of modernisation of military equipment for any large group of countries, because that would be impossible for the American taxpayer,\" he said.\nThe U.S. government estimated last month that the total cost to bring in former Warsaw Pact members would be between $27 billion and $35 billion up to the year 2009.\nOf this, the United States is expected to bear costs of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, the Clinton administration said in a report to Congress.\nThe frontrunners are all struggling to find the finances for modernising their military to the alliance's standards in the midst of massive economic reforms.\nConstantinescu, at the end of a two day visit to Prague, did not say how Romania might eventually meet the cost of military modernisation.\nBut the Bucharest government launched a programme last year to seek credits for up to $400 million to pay for military modernisation.\nRomanian military planners have said the government expects to spend about three percent of gross domestic product in total military spending this year, or roughly $900 million.\n", "Ford Motor Co. halted light truck assembly lines at three plants Friday as planned because of a strike at a seat supplier, but signed up another company to help it clear out the backlog of 7,700 Expeditions built without proper seats.\nFollowing an appeal from Ford Chairman Alex Trotman, Lear Corp. Chairman Kenneth Way agreed to have his company make seats for Ford's Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle once the walkout is settled, according to sources in the supply industry.\nUnder the arrangement, Lear, which already is a large Ford supplier, would make second and third row seats for the Expedition, said Donna Parolini, president of International Business Development Corp., a consulting firm in Troy, Mich.\nFront seats for the vehicles are being made by Ford's Chesterfield, Mich., trim plant, Ford officials have said. Ford spokesman Bert Serre said the plant has been making a limited number of seats, less than 20 an hour.\nFord suspended all production at its Michigan Assembly in Wayne, which makes the Expedition and F-Series pickup trucks, after the United Auto Workers and Johnson Controls Inc. failed to settle a strike, which entered its 11th day Friday.\nOhio plants affected were the Econoline and Club Wagon full-size van assembly line in Lorain and a frame production line at Ohio Assembly in Avon Lake. About 6,800 workers were idled as a result of the action.\nIndustry analysts said the strike has Ford in a huge bind. The Expedition is one of its most profitable and popular vehicles, earning Ford an estimated pre-tax profit of $10,000 each. Under normal production, it makes 840 vehicles at day Michigan Truck, the only plant where the Expedition is made.\nBut to avoid angering its own UAW workers, Ford refused to accept seats made by non-union replacement workers. It had been making the vehicles with temporary seats. But after making about 14,800 Expeditions and Econolines without proper seats, Ford decided to shut production down completely.\n\"To interrupt Expedition production for any extended period of time would hurt Ford financially in North America,\" said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich.\nBecause Ford and Lear do not want to provoke the UAW, Lear, which has unionized plants, would not start producing seats until the strike is over, said Parolini. Another issue prohibiting Lear from making seats immediately is the fact that it buys seat frames from the same Johnson Controls facility that assembles seats for Ford.\nShutting down Expedition production means an extension of the three- to six-month wait that many consumers already face. Introduced last fall, the Expedition has been a huge hit with buyers looking for a sleek, larger sport utility.\n\"The reception of this vehicle has been the highest of anything I've seen since the original Mustang,\" said Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the largest Ford dealers in the country.\nAbout 500 UAW members struck Johnson Controls seat plants January 28 in Plymouth, Mich., and Oberlin, Ohio, when talks broke down on a new contract.\nJeff Steiner, a spokesman for Johnson Controls' automotive unit, said no talks occurred Friday after they broke off late Thursday. No new negotiations were scheduled for the weekend.\nSteiner declined to characterize the discussions, which have restarted and collapsed several times since the strike began over terms for a new contract.\n", "Pearson Plc chief executive Marjorie Scardino began to reshape the British media and leisure company on Friday as she sold its 10 percent stake in Hong Kong broadcaster TVB for 111.1 million pounds ($180.1 million).\nThe stake in TVB, Hong Kong's leading television broadcaster, has been bought by Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Ltd and associates.\nThe disposal is the first major strategic move by Texan Scardino since she took over at Pearson last month.\n\"Our commitment to the growth of our businesses in Asia/Pacific is as strong as ever, but we have decided that this investment is no longer effective in developing either our television business or our other interests in the region,\" Scardino said.\nPearson acquired the stake in TVB two years ago for 106.2 million pounds and has received dividends of 3.5 million pounds on it.\nShare analysts were pleased that Scardino had made an early move in her attempts to improve the focus of the business and said that Pearson had done well to recover its investment.\n\"It's obviously a blow to Greg Dyke,\" said one, referring to the head of Pearson's television arm, adding that Scardino appeared to have reversed part of his strategy.\nThere has been speculation that Dyke, a well-known figure in the British media world, may shortly part company with Pearson.\nDyke said that the investment had given Pearson great insight into the television business in Asia.\n\"However since we made the minority investment Pearson Television's strategy has evolved to concentrate on programme making and larger broadcast roles,\" he added.\nPearson shares stood unchanged at 764.5p after the announcement.\nDebt rating agency Moody's said on Friday it was downgrading Pearson. Moody's said that this reflected its view that Pearson's debt protection measurements -- weakened by recent acquisitions -- would not recover to previous levels near term.\nScardino, the first woman to head a leading British company, has promised to improve Pearson's profit performance.\nThe company has a clutch of big-name assets such as the Financial Times newspaper and Penguin Books but has failed to secure an adequate return on these.\nAnalysts say that the company lacks focus and have predicted that Pearson may sell its Tussauds leisure unit and its stake in merchant bank Lazards.\nThe Scardino era got off to a bad start when the company announced last week that improper accounting at Penguin USA would force it to make a charge of up to 100 million pounds against 1996 profits.\nPearson said the problems dated back five years but had come to light only very recently.

It also gives us a presence and a place to understand (customers') needs more directly,\" he said. \"I think it is possible to continue those kind of things, looking at other service opportunities.\"\nCondit said he met European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert in Brussels earlier this week and reiterated that he expects approval of the MDD merger.\n\"I don't see any restrictions at this point,\" he said. \"The overlap of the businesses is very little, so we're not faced with significant plant closures, we don't have products that overlap.\" he added, \"There will be a lot of discussion, a lot of data, but in the end it will be approved.\"\nBoeing expects the McDonnell merger to generate around $1 billion of savings, mainly by cutting head office staff, Condit said. The biggest task will be to get 200,000 people working togther efficiently, he added.\nCondit played down anticompetitive fears expressed by European rival Airbus Industrie, especially in helicopters, saying they were in different markets. Boeing makes twin-rotor, heavy lift helicopters, while McDonnell Douglas makes light, commercial products, he said. With four U.S. helicopter makers, industry obervers have said there was room for consolidation, he added.\nCondit denied it was in Boeing's interest to force its U.S. suppliers to stay away from partnering Airbus on its A3XX large plane project, as alleged by Airbus partner Daimler-Benz Aerospace .\nBoeing wants its subcontractors to \"have a broader business base, to spread overhead costs and deliver more economical products,\" he said. It also wants to expand collaboration with foreign companies, such as British Aerospace Plc.\nCondit said there are no conflicts for BAe, which is an Airbus partner, in working with Boeing.\n", "While he ruled China, Deng Xiaoping politely declined the worshipful personality cult that grew up around his predecessor, Chairman Mao Zedong.\nWith his death last Wednesday, however, the floodgates were opened for what could be the start of the \"Deng market\" as books, posters and comics featuring the patriarch swept into stores ahead of his funeral on Tuesday.\nIn Shanghai, China's fast-beating mercantile heart, more than 80 branches of the state-run Xinhua bookstore had taken delivery of glossy Deng posters to meet anticipated demand, the Liberation Daily said.\nThousands of sets of the pictures, entitled \"The Architect of China's Opening, Reform and Modernisation -- Deng Xiaoping\", had been flown to Shanghai from publishing houses in various parts of China, it said.\nElsewhere, the People's Daily reported that \"people old and young, men and women, including officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and young students\" had waited in line for hours in Beijing to buy Deng portraits.\nThe state's rush to push out Deng memorabilia follows long years during which China's 1.2 billion people rarely saw even a photo of their paramount leader.\nAfter the excesses of Mao worship during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Deng made a clear break in leadership style by insisting on a low public profile. On retiring from his last official post in 1991, he dropped almost completely from view.\nThere was a brief burst of Deng propaganda in 1992, when he successfully overruled communist hardliners and pushed his capitalist-style economic reforms to a new pitch. After that, however, Deng vanished again from the public eye.\nHis death at 92, however, freed Deng's heirs to make the most out of his political patronage and China's state stores and news media were ordered to begin cranking out memorials and mementoes as quickly as possible.\nIn one store in Shanghai, a city which has benefited greatly from Deng's reforms, biographies, collections of Deng's thoughts on socialism and economic development -- and handbooks explaining them -- were selling well.\n\"China has hope because of Deng Xiaoping,\" said one 73-year-old man poring over a selection of Deng's works at a bookshop on the city's premier shopping street, Nanjing Road.\nHe was buying a book for his grandson, he said, and had chosen \"Xiaoping Says -- What is Socialism\", which for 7.60 yuan ($0.91) uses simple cartoons to explain Deng's theories.\n\"He was the greatest leader China ever had,\" the man said.\n\"Look at what he did -- he brought the country out of chaos, he came up with the 'one country, two systems' theory for the return of Hong Kong, and he retired early.

eager to cash in on higher refined oil products prices abroad and at home and to replenish books with cash for big-ticket production projects -- were beginning to eye downstream and upstream consolidation, analysts said.\nWhile it was early for formal mergers, they said Russian companies were beginning to lay the groundwork for acquisitions and a shakeout of the sector's dozen or so vertically-integrated companies and eight independent firms was inevitable after 1998.\n\"Undoubtedly we will see a winnowing,\" said Stephen O'Sullivan, director of oil and gas at MC Securities in London.\n\"There are too many oil companies and not all can survive.\"\nMoscow has transformed its old Soviet production associations into vertically-integrated companies, but the process left most

conducted tolling operations -- supplying crude oil for processing at plants they do not own and then taking it back for resale.\nIn a second takeover battle, an industry source said oil major SIDANCO and mini-major Sibneft were tussling for Rosneft, the state oil holding firm which holds the government's stake in production-sharing deals and is slated for privatisation.\nAnalysts said a third shakeout could see Sibneft making a play for the East Siberian Oil and Gas exploration company.\n\"Downstream in Russia, something has to happen,\" said a senior Western consultant. \"The money's not coming back to the producers, and something has to be consolidated.\"\nBut upstream consolidation is also inevitable, since the future of Russian oil is in hard-to-recover, remote, expensive reserves requiring a pooling of cash and technical expertise.\n\"If you're aiming at economies of scale in five years, you've got to start the (consolidation) process now, and that's what we're seeing\" said the Western consultant.\nOne such deal tried and failed last year, when former Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik tried to create a giant oil corporation by merging four companies -- the Tyumen Oil Company, ONAKO, the Eastern Oil Company and Slavneft.\n\"The general feeling is that only those strong enough in terms of corporate structures and centralised cash flows will be looking to pick up assets in the upstream business,\" said a Russian energy analyst at a Western investment bank in Moscow.\nBut analysts said mergers were already on many companies' agendas.\n\"There are two driving forces here,\" said O'Sullivan. \"A desire to move into downstream, and a drive by existing companies to consolidate their existing holdings fast.\"\n-- Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520\n", "Barclays Plc shares slid lower on Tuesday after the bank announced 1996 pretax profits at the lower end of market expectations, including a slump in its investment banking unit BZW.\nThe shares were quoted 25p lower at 1174.5p at 1150 GMT, having hit a low of 1131p, after news that pretax profits rose by 13 percent to 2.36 billion pounds ($3.82 billion), including an exceptional 70 million pounds gain on disposals.\nThis was at the low end of analysts' forecasts and included a 29 percent fall in operating profits at BZW to 204 million pounds.\nThe group, which has already performed more than one billion pounds of share repurchases in the last 18 months, said it would return 500 million pounds to shareholders in the next 12 months and raised its dividend by 21 percent to 31.5 pence, in line with forecasts.\nChief executive Martin Taylor mounted a spirited defence of the results and his strategy at BZW, saying that the British banking figures were \"cracking\" and that Barclays was investing for the future at the investment bank.\n\"You have to be careful not to be frightened by your own shadow,\" Taylor told Reuters in an interview. \"The reason that the returns are depressed (at BZW) this year is that we're spending so much.\"\nTaylor said that if Barclays had invested less in BZW, the unit's profits would have been higher, but that without the investment, BZW would be a weaker firm.\nIn a statement earlier, Barclays reported underperformance by BZW in the fixed income market, with the exception of sterling, and in foreign exchange, in which said it had performed poorly in an increasingly competitive market.\nTaylor said BZW would continue to incur quite high costs in the first half of the current year and would then face the disruption of moving its offices to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands.\n\"I would hope that the second half would be a lot better,\" he added.\nBZW has had a turbulent time in the past year, which started with the death of its chief executive, David Band, and has included high-level management shake-ups.\nIt has also been involved in what have been perceived as some high-profile problems with clients. The biggest of these was its takeover defence for Northern Electric against U.S. energy group CE Electric, which is being investigated by Britain's Takeover Panel.\nThe late disclosure by BZW of a 250,000 stg discretionary fee clause meant that CE's offer was extended and it captured Northern by the slimmest of margins.\nBut Taylor said that well-publicised events last year, such as the Northern Electric defence, had not done BZW damage.\n\"I think Northern Electric showed BZW behaving very energetically to try and prevent a client being taken over and almost succeeding,\" Taylor said. \"We very nearly saved it.\"\nOn the share price reaction, one broker's head of equity sales said, \"The results were very disappointing and there will be some downgrades as a result.\n\"The trials and tribulations at the investment banking arm look as if they will probably be continuing into the next year,\" he said.\nTaylor said Barclays was looking for the best way to return the bank's excess capital to shareholders but rejected the idea of a special dividend, saying that share repurchases help non-sellers to concentrate their position.\nHe noted that earnings per share had risen by 25 percent to 104.2p.\nTaylor also rejected the notion that Barclays was devoid of ideas because it wanted to return capital.\nHe said the bank would make acquisitions if they added to shareholder value but could see none on the horizon at present.\n\"We're already growing very quickly right across our personal sector business,\" Taylor said. \"Both the personal bank and the business bank have had a cracking year.\"\n", "The rapidly evolving market for stored-value cards could be hurt by premature government regulation, one of the top U.S. bank regulators said in a report issued Wednesday.\nAn array of companies, including banks, credit card networks and others, are trying to popularize stored value or \"smart\" cards that carry electronic currency. But the cards have yet to catch on with consumers.\nFederal Reserve Board, which regulates banks and runs the payment system used to tranfer hundreds of billions of dollars a day among financial institutions, evaluated possible regulation of smart cards under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.\n\"Early regulation of electronic stored-value products could cause higher regulatory costs than later regulation,\" the Fed said in its report. Regulations could be costly for smart card providers and might arbitrarily favor one type of product over another, the Fed said.\n\"Given the limited experience with stored value products to date, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the benefits to consumers from any particular Regulation E provision would outweigh the corresponding costs of compliance,\" the report noted.\nRegulation E sets out the Fed's rules for electronic funds transfers, including protecting consumers against fraudulent or mistaken transfers.\nSen Bob Bennett, chairman of the Senate banking Committee's subcommittee on financial services and technology who criticized an initial Fed plan to regulate smart cards, welcomed the report.\n\"For the first time, the Federal Reserve has carefully considered the cost of action as well as the potential cost of inaction with regard to the implementation of new regulations on the fledgling stored-value card industry,\" the Utah Republican said.\nLast April, the Fed had proposed applying some parts of the funds transfer act to smart cards. But Bennett and others in Congress opposed that move and passed legislation requiring a report before any action was taken.\nEarly regulation could have some benefits, however, the Fed said. Government rules have \"the potential to speed up development by promoting standardization and by removing uncertainty.\"\nIn any event, the market will probably grow slowly, the Fed predicted. \"Widespread public acceptance of stored-value products, if it occurs at all, will likely develop slowly over many years,\" the report said. \"Their introduction seems unlikely to change the fundamental nature of our current payment system in the near future.\"\nDavid Jung, senior analyst at the market research firm Killen &amp; Associates, agreed. \"We expect solid growth of about 25 percent a year but we don't see any break-out yet,\" Jung said.\nVolume of smart card transaction is expected to grow from under one billion transactions this year to about 10 billion worldwide in 2001, Jung said.\nFairly soon, smart cards could be used to pay for everything from parking meters to magazines published on the Internet, Jung said.\n((202-898-8312))\n", "After two years of hype and euphoria about the Internet and its sweeping impact on the computer industry, a reality check is setting in as investors are asking: Where's the money?\nA Tucson, Ariz., industry conference this week called PC Forum -- a \"schmooze fest\" once populated mostly by the upper echelon of the computer industry -- brought together telecommunications and media company leaders as well as those from computer behemoths and start-ups.\nMany attendees said there is more concern now about profits and business models.\n\"It's now coming to practical terms,\" said Ed Bennett, former president of the Prodigy Services online service. \"Where is the money coming from? ... But the raw potential of the industry hasn't changed, and that's a good thing.\"\nSo far, it is still not clear what type of business plan will lead to hefty revenues and profits from the Internet, whether it be advertising-based, subscription-based or some other way of making money.\nRecent failures or financial problems at Web-based ventures, such as the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of American Cybercast, one of the first Web soap opera sites, are causing concern.\nExecutives also pointed to the recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Amazon.com, which pioneered bookselling on the Internet, for its anticipated initial public offering (IPO).\nSeattle-based Amazon.com, known as one of the most successful ventures and best-known examples of Internet commerce, said it lost $5.8 million in 1996, mostly due to increased investments in technology and marketing.\n\"There is no question that there is an increased focus on the part of analysts and investors on when are they going to make money,\" said Sheldon Laube, chief technology officer of U.S. Web., a privately held Santa Clara, Calif. company which franchises Web development, training and consulting services.\n\"It's a healthy part of the evolution of the business,\" Laube said. \"The hype is now evolving into reality and ultimately that is what technology is all about.\"\nWhile the conference is a forum for discussing industry issues and exchanging ideas -- sometimes lofty and intellectual ones such as the use of metaphors and language to describe this new medium -- a number of small start-up companies come to make their debut before their peers. Industry executives, analysts and investors come to meet and make deals in the hallways.\nThis year, in the so-called \"debutantes\" presentations, many venture capitalists, Wall Street analysts and fund managers checked out 12 early start-ups.\nThe PC Forum, run by industry guru Esther Dyson, is considered such an important part of a start-up company's debut that Fast Company magazine followed around executives of two small companies to chronicle their participation at the conference.\n\"This is the 'Lollapalooza' of the Internet,\" Bennett said, who remains on Prodigy's board, referring to the alternative music festival. \"Not every band is going to get signed.\"\nThis year, questions about business models dominated many start-up presentations more than the technology. During a presentation by a start-up called NetBot Inc., whose Internet \"shopping assistant\" made its debut, one attendee interrupted to ask about the Seattle-based firm's business model, even before the company demonstrated its software called Jango.\n\"People are much more pragmatic when they look at these companies,\" said Bruce Smith, a Merrill Lynch Internet analyst. \"You like to look at companies that have thought through their business model and how they will compete with the 800-pound gorilla (Microsoft Corp.).\"\nAnd as the stocks of other publicly traded companies such as Internet search engines firms like Yahoo! Inc., Excite Inc., and Lycos Inc. ; Internet access providers; online services and other Internet software companies continue to drop on Wall Street, start-ups compete for fewer and fewer venture capital dollars.\nSome promising IPO candidates are also mulling being acquired, such as PointCast Inc.'s much-rumoured discussions two weeks ago to be acquired by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the owner of the Fox television network and newspapers such as the New York Post.\nPointCast, a pioneer in so-called push technology, said last week its present intention was to remain independent.\n\"In the venture capital business, you can see the transition from a seller's market to a buyer's market,\" said Roger McNamee, general partner at Integral Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. \"Entrepreneurs are beginning to wonder where their next dollar of capital will come from.\"\nEven in its new-found pragmatism, the industry remains ever optimistic about the future. Conference leader Dyson and many of the speakers gathered together at the end of the conference with the creator of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, who now heads up the World Wide Web Consortium.\n\"The competition is what produces the incredible rate of development,\" Berners-Lee said.\n", "Dozens of Japanese banks may close their foreign operations in the next few years as their huge problem loans make it hard to meet new capital requirements, analysts say.\nTwo of Japan's top 20 banks have already announced they will shut down their overseas branches, and some analysts say many others should follow suit, delivering possible boosts to profitability.\n\"Japanese banks must cut unprofitable assets overseas to boost return on equity,\" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc.\n\"All that many of them are doing overseas is providing services to Japanese customers, rather than doing business with local customers in host countries. They are doing Japanese business even in overseas markets.\"\nHe said that over the next few years, the number of Japanese banks operating abroad could fall to about a third of the current 85. There are a total of 149 banks in Japan.\nEarlier this month, two of Japan's most troubled banks, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB) and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd announced restructuring plans that included pulling out of overseas operations. Hokkaido also said it would merge with regional bank Hokkaido Bank Ltd.\nHokkaido Bank closed its overseas offices last year, saying they were not profitable.\nFinancial authorities, worried that Japan's banking problems could destabilise global financial markets, do not object to Japanese banks closing overseas.\nSei Nakai, senior deputy director-general of the Finance Ministry's banking bureau, recently told Reuters the ministry had proposed the step to NCB and Hokkaido Takushoku to avoid the possibility of Japanese banks troubling foreign creditors.\nHe also said the ministry might tell other Japanese banks to retreat \"quietly\" from their overseas operations if they were in trouble.\nAnalysts say tougher capital adequacy requirements scheduled to be introduced from the end of March 1998 under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) could encourage Japanese banks to close their international operations.\nJames Fiorillo, a financial analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd, said some Japanese banks were expected to try to boost their capital to meet the BIS requirements. But others would likely take a second look at continuing internationally.\nUnder BIS capital adequacy requirements set in the late 1980s, Japanese banks operating internationally need capital equivalent to a minimum of 8.0 percent of risk-weighted assets.\nIn 1995, the BIS set second-stage guidelines that factor in market risk when determining capital requirements. This means Japanese banks operating abroad will have to take into account risks from activities such as foreign exchange transactions and swaps when calculating adequacy ratios from this fiscal year.\nSome analysts calculate that the introduction of these second-stage guidelines could cut international capital adequacy ratios of Japanese banks by up to 0.3 percent.\nKatsuhiro Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Center, said major commercial, trust and long-term credit banks and big regional banks would not abandon overseas operations.\nBut smaller regional banks burdened by problem loans would do so as their low credit ratings had made it increasingly expensive for them to raise capital, he said.\nSasajima said some Japanese banks would likely seek foreign partners in order to maintain their services abroad.\nEarlier this month, NCB said it would tie up with Bankers Trust New York Corp to help turn some of its loans into cash and to maintain services to overseas customers.\n", "Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd on Wednesday announced it would ramp up exploration spending this year as it sought to diversify away from the lucrative gas fields of the North West Shelf.\nWoodside unveiled its aggressive exploration programme for calendar 1997, much of its centred outside the offshore North West Shelf fields, after reporting a 58 percent surge in annual net earnings to A$191 million for 1996.\nWoodside's shares shot up on the profit announcement, which was in line with market expectations.  \nThe stock closed at the day's high of A$8.97 on Wednesday, up 31 cents on Tuesday's close, confirming the market's bright view of Woodside.\nWoodside said it would more than double exploration spending in 1997 to a record A$120 million with over half of this being thrown at the company's interests in the Timor Sea.\n\"Certainly this is an order-of-magnitude increase in non-North West Shelf exploration activity,\" Akehurst told a news conference in Melbourne.\nWoodside plans to drill 12 to 14 exploration wells, including eight or nine outside the North West Shelf, he added.  \nAkehurst also announced in North West Shelf's proven reserves, with ultimate gas recovery leaping 60 percent to 24.4 trillion cubic feet (tcf) at the end of 1996.\nOil reserves rose 11 percent to 175 million barrels and condensate reserves were up 21 percent to 690 million barrels.\nWoodside expressed confidence the North West Shelf would meet the 30 tcf in gas reserves needed to justify a doubling of LNG capacity to meet growing demand from Japanese customers.\n\"Quite clearly we see considerable upside...,\" Akehurst said, citing estimated possible reserves of 45 tcf.  \nEqual partners in the North West Shelf are Woodside, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Japan Australia LNG (MiMi) Pty Ltd, a partnership of Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp, Chevron Corp and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.\nThe six partners plan to double annual LNG production to 14 million tonnes by 2003 at a capital cost of A$6 billion.\nThe North West Shelf partners and owners of the nearby Gorgon gas field have been discussing the prospects of merging the two developments, with a view to expanding the North West Shelf's existing LNG plant further.  \n\"I think the exciting prospect is to see how we can move on from there and look for opportunities with third parties to expand that project,\" Akehurst said.\nHe said he would welcome any proposal to merge Gorgon with North West Shelf production \"to cooperate on a sixth and seventh train\". Currently, the North West Shelf partners plan to expand their Burrup Pensinsula plant to five trains.\nChevron, Texaco Inc and Shell each hold two-seventh stakes in Gorgon, with Mobil Corp owning one-seventh.\n-- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421\n", "After 19 months of sometimes violent confrontations, six striking newspaper unions on Friday made an unconditional offer to return to work at Detroit's two major daily papers.\nAl Derey, head of the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions, said the action was not an act of surrender but a tactic to expose the papers to potentially huge financial losses if they do not agree to a fair contract.\n\"Our position is this strike has not ended. This is simply a new strategy to try to win a fair and decent contract from two corporate giants that don't have any souls,\" a visibly emotional Derey told a news conference.\nAbout 2,500 distribution, pressroom, newsroom and mailroom workers walked off their jobs at the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News in July 1995 after contract talks collapsed.\nThe papers are editorially indepdendent and have separate owners but have been published under a joint operating agreement since 1989.\nKnight-Ridder Inc. owns the Free Press. The News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc.\nA representative from Detroit Newspapers Inc, the joint operating agency, could not be reached for comment.\nThe papers have published every day since the strike began, although early on they only published a single joint edition. More than 400 of the original strikers have cross picket lines. The papers have hired about 1,400 replacements.\nSince the start of the strike, which has often erupted in violent confrontations between supporters and private security guards, circulation at the papers has fallen 30 percent. Advertising revenues are down between 15 percent and 20 percent.\nDerey told reporters the advertising boycott has cost the papers a combined $250 million, and 700,000 readers have dropped subscriptions. But because the newspapers \"still don't get it,\" he said the unions need to adopt a new strategy.\nIf the papers reject the return-to-work offer, they could be liable for back pay from the time the offer was made if they were found to have commited unfair labor practices, said Derey. That amounts to $250,000 a day, or $1 million a year, he said.\nThe action Friday is a controversial one for many union members, who are staunchly opposed to returning to work. But Derey appealed for their support.\n\"This wasn't the only strategy and it isn't the easiest, but it is the best way we've got to take on these corporate powers and get us moving again down the road to a fair contract,\" he said.\nOne local labor analyst said the union's move was an acknowledgement the strike as a means of leverage has reached the point of diminishing returns. But it does force management to make some difficult decisions.\n\"What the unions are doing now is upping the legal ante,\" said Steve Babson, labor program specialist at Wayne State University's Labor Studies Center.\nIf the papers do not agree to take back all of the striking workers, they could be liable for the back pay penalities if they commited unfair labor practices, a legal process that could take years to resolve, he said.\nThe Detroit regional director of the NLRB has accused the companies of unfair labor practices, finding they did not bargain in good faith. The company appealed that decision to an administrative law judge, who has not yet issued a ruling.\n", "Australia's largest home mortgage lender, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), announced a surprisingly strong 11 percent surge in first half 1996/97 profits on Wednesday, despite erosion of its interest margins.\nCBA said good cost control and a 33 percent surge in business lending more than offset a further squeeze in home loan margins.\n\"Business volumes during the first half of 1996/97 were pleasing, leading to a better than expected interim result,\" CBA managing director David Murray told a news conference.\n\"This is likely to lead to a slightly better than expected full-year result,\" Murray said.\nCBA's net profit for the six months to December 31 rose to A$602 million (US$455 million) from A$542 million in the comparable period a year earlier.\nCBA had itself been saying until now that it expected hot competition in its key home loan market would squeeze margins and keep profits flat in the year to June 30, 1997.\nAnalysts too had expected a subdued profit performance, forecasting a profit of between A$535 million and A$560 million.\nCBA's shares rallied sharply on the profit and on news of a interim dividend of 45 cents per share, up seven cents on the previous interim dividend.\nCBA's shares closed up 50.1 cents at A$13.91, having climbed in afternoon trade to a record high of A$14.00. CBA's surge led the All Ordinaries index overall to a record closing high of 2,473.5, up 25.4 points.\n\"Obviously the market liked it. The profit was probably about A$50 million above expectations and there was a nice increase in the dividend,\" said Lance Jones dealer Hamish Dee.\nAnalysts later said they would increase their forecasts for CBA's full-year profit by about A$50 million to A$1.15 billion.\nBut CBA dampened optimism about its business lending boom on Wednesday by cutting its key varible home mortgage rate to 7.55 percent from 8.25 percent, ensuring further margin pressure.\nCBA's group net interest margin fell to 3.71 percent in the first half from 4.12 percent in the first half of 1995/96 and Murray said the latest cut would further erode margins.\nThis is CBA's second unilateral home loan interest rate cut in less than a year. The bank cut its key variable home loan rate to 9.9 percent from 10.5 percent in May.\nThat cut triggered a round of mortgage rate cuts by the other major banks and was generally seen as the catalyst to a 50 to 75 basis point cut in big bank home loan margins.\nBut CBA's pre-emptive strike was also popular with home lenders, who increased their lending from the bank by 14 percent in the half.\nMurray said the latest home loan cuts had more to do with increasingly aggressive competition in the home loan market than with any pre-emption of another cut in official cash rates.\nNon bank lenders like Aussie Home Loans have snared about 10 percent of the home loan market in the last three years with cheap loans funded by securitised bond issues.\nCBA also said its efforts to control costs and increase productivity were a factor in the better than expected profit.\nMeanwhile, CBA confirmed that it was looking closely at securitising some of its mortgage portfolio and that it was not looking at issuing a special dividend, contrary to speculation.\n(A$1=US$0.75)\n", "Michael Foods Inc said Wednesday it is considering options for its potato operations, including possibly divesting the business that includes frozen french fries and refrigerated potatoes.\n\"We're going to be looking over the next couple of quarters as to what we're going to do with that total potato business,\" Gregg Ostrander, president, said in an interview here.  \nThe options being explored by the company, whose largest business is extended shelf-life and processed eggs, include potentially divesting the entire potato operation.\n\"That's one of the things we're going to explore,\" Ostrander said. \"We're going through a lot of options now.\"\nHe said no decisions have been made as yet.\nMichael Foods was among the companies presenting at an analyst conference here.

The company will soon close on its acquisition of Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products Inc, extending its product line in food service and retail liquid eggs.\nWhile Papetti's and Michal Foods egg businesses will be run separately, Ostrander said he sees the potential to reap $8 million to $15 million in synergies, starting in the fourth quarter of this year.\nThe Papetti's deal will give Michael Foods access to East Coast egg processing operations, complementing its existing Midwest operations.\n((Reuters Chicago Newsdesk  312-408-8787))\n", "Shares in British publisher Dorling Kindersley Holdings Plc lost almost 20 percent of their value on Tuesday after the company warned that profits would fall short of last year's level.\nTraders wiped over 40 million pounds ($64 million) off Dorling's value as the company warned tough conditions in the U.S. retail book market, currency movements and increased investment in its direct selling business would hit profits.\nIt restated its profits for the year to end-June 1996 to 12.9 million pounds ($20.5 million) from 17.4 million pounds to reflect a change in the way it accounts for multimedia development costs.\nManaging director Rod Hare said profits would fall \"somewhat short\" of 12.9 million pounds but would not specify how much.\nThe warning, the second in little more than three months, sent Dorling shares spiralling 60p lower to 261p by 1025 GMT.\nThe value of the company has halved to around 180 million pounds since the company warned of the likely impact of sterling strength in early December.\nDorling reported a nine percent rise in pre-tax profit to 6.8 million pounds in the six months to December 31. Interim dividend was left unchanged at 1.5 pence per share.\n\"The primary factor for the downgrade in the profit forecast is...the U.S. book market has not performed as expected,\" managing director Hare told Reuters.\nHare said that Dorling had suffered from a change in policy at leading U.S. book retail chains Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble, which had cleared out their stock and cut new orders after their store expansion programmes slowed.\nHare said that Dorling believed that a more normal re-order pattern would be restored later this year for back order books, However, he expects the U.S. chains to continue to order less initial stock of new titles.\nDorling earns more than 40 percent of revenue in dollars and Hare said that the strength of the pound would result in \"well over a million pounds of lost profit\" this year.

He's no Mao Zedong and he's no Deng Xiaoping,\" said one Chinese political analyst. \"He can't do whatever he likes.\"\nOn the second day of official mourning after Deng's death, Jiang appeared to have taken a bold first step in the shadowy political minuet danced by those who rule China from the highest echelons of the Communist Party.\nJiang vowed even greater successes than those achieved by Deng in pushing ahead with the diminutive patriarch's capitalist-style reforms.\n\"Jiang Zemin committed a political blunder,\" said one well-connected political analyst. \"He said it too early. He could have waited.\n\"He's giving his political rivals something with which to attack him,\" he said.\n\"Deng Xiaoping had qualities that differed from Mao Zedong. But what does Jiang Zemin have?\" he asked.\nThat question may be on the lips not only of political analysts but of Jiang's rivals to rule China.\nSince imperial China, the transfer of the \"mandate of heaven\" to a new emperor -- or party chief -- has rarely been smooth. The latest power shift so far has been seamless, but upheavals cannot be ruled out, analysts said.\nIn recent days, Jiang has come under veiled attack from leftist hardliners who are nostalgic for Mao's authoritarian rule and who see Deng's death as an opportunity to push their conservative policies.\nJiang, 70, must now confront his own mortality and fend off other aspirants to power, among them Qiao Shi, the former security tsar who now heads parliament, economic supremo Zhu Rongji and Premier Li Peng.\nJiang appears strong, after amassing the top jobs in the party, the government and the three-million-strong armed forces. But analysts say his opponents are well-placed to expose his weaknesses.\n\"For Jiang Zemin right now, he is much in the running,\" said one Western diplomat. \"He has especially in the last year made a very decisive break from being under Deng's shadow.\n\"He had been always very cautious to keep within Deng's policy line,\" he said. \"But in the past year, he has significantly defined himself as someone who is very separate from Deng.\"\nHe may have been over-ambitious in taking all of China's top three positions.\nThe only other communist official to hold those three posts was Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng, a colourless rural bureaucrat who was deposed within two years by Deng.\nAs one of the 459 members of Deng's Funeral Committee, Hua is expected to make a rare appearance at the memorial rites on Tuesday, a poignant reminder to Jiang -- who is expected to deliver the eulogy -- of what happens to those who lose out in a power struggle in China.\n", "Loss-making airline Ansett Australia said on Wednesday it would not survive unless it made major changes to turn the business around.\nAnsett executive chairman Rod Eddington, in his first major speech since his appointment last year, said the airline needed to sell out of resorts and other non-core assets, even if this meant wearing a loss.\nHe said Ansett must free up cash and improve its operating performance to fund the airline's expanding core business, including eight new aircraft it needed to rationalise its fleet.  \nThe contract for the new aircraft orders, said to be worth over A$2 billion, is a close contest between European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie and Boeing Co.\nAnsett is owned equally by Air New Zealand and media group News Corp.\nIn a frank assessment, Eddington called Ansett an excellent airline but a poor business which needed to cut unit costs but at the same time increase customer service.\n\"Unless Ansett changes, it won't survive in the medium to long term,\" he told the National Aviation Press Club.  \n\"There's no point in taking any business to the market until it's in pretty robust shape. Ansett is a long, long way away from that now,\" he said.\n\"It takes time ... it takes two to three years, not two to three months,\" he added.\nThe decision on Ansett's new long-term fleet plan, expected to be made by the board early in the second half of 1997, will be crucial to Ansett's future, Eddington said.\nIt is a close call between Airbus's A330-200 and Boeing's 767-300. \"It's the closest one I have been part of,\" he said.  \nEddington foreshadowed another poor result for the year to June 30, 1997, saying that profits were \"thin on the ground\".\nHe would not even discuss Ansett's level of gearing which, according to the airline's balance sheet at June 30 last year, means that for every A$1 of equity, Ansett owes A$9 in debt.\n\"If we were floating at the moment, it would make things a little difficult,\" Eddington said.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the country's competition watchdog, could also make life difficult for Ansett's alliance with Air New Zealand.  \nACCC approval will be needed for the two carriers to go ahead and work together on ground services, information technology, procurement and marketing and sales, he said.\n\"This work will ultimately lead to an application for ACCC authorisation,\" Eddington said.\n-- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421\n", "DeKalb Genetics Corp, which reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results, said Monday it expects higher margins and increased market share for its key U.S. and Canadian seed corn operations this year.\n\"We have already said that we will be $4 per unit in gross margins better in North American seed,\" Thomas Rauman, chief financial officer, said in an interview.  \"And we have stated we expect to sell more seed corn this year than last year.\"  \nInternational income, which nearly doubled to $5.9 million in the first quarter ended November 30, likely will be up by a double-digit percentage for all of fiscal 1997, Rauman added.\nHe declined to comment specifically about earnings for the year.  But analysts said DeKalb, the number two North American seed corn supplier with about an 11 percent market share, will see sharply higher earnings in fiscal 1997.\nDain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg raised her fiscal 1997 earnings estimate to $1.42 a share from $1.35.  DeKalb earned $1.03 a share in fiscal 1996.  \nIn the first quarter, international results were \"ahead of schedule,\" Rauman said, enabling the company to post a profit of $0.12 a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $0.01.\nNatWest Securities analyst Mark Wiltamuth said the consensus for the first quarter had been a loss of $0.02 a share.  The seed company typically loses money in the first quarter since it has no earnings then in North America.\n\"We feel very good about North American operations,\" Rauman said. \"Our seed orders are very strong this year.\"\nEarly cash sales, a good indicator of future seed demand, are up this year from last year, Rauman added.  \nBased on these early cash sales, Wittenburg said she believes DeKalb will at least meet its goal of increasing seed corn market share in the U.S. and Canada by one-half to one full share point.\nDeKalb gained a full market share point last year. The top seed corn supplier in the U.S. and Canada is Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc.\nIn its swine operations, in which DeKalb sells breeding stock to farmers, Rauman said the first quarter results were below last year, primarily due to higher feed costs.\nSwine earnings for the year, however, are expected to be higher than last year, Rauman added.\n((Reuters Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))\n", "China is awash with steel and suppliers scrambling for a piece of one of the world's few active markets and keeping prices down while they go about it, traders and industry executives in Asia said on Tuesday.\n\"The competition is forcing prices down,\" a senior executive with a Western firm said.\nPrices had fallen 10 percent and more over the past couple of months, an executive with a Japanese steelmaker said, with cold-rolled steel fetching between $400 and $430 a tonne and galvanized steel up to $100 less than that.\nSteel industry figures said China was flooded with cheap steel, much of it from the former Soviet Union, and most gave a pessimistic outlook for the recovery of the Chinese market.\n\"I can't see the bottom yet,\" the Japanese executive said. \"People have been hoping for a recovery, but I think there is no hope for improvement within this year.\"\nFigures published in the official Chinese press in July showed imports of steel billet and rolled steel in the first five months of 1995 at 6.83 million tonnes, up 18.9 percent on the same 1995 period.\nExports of these products were down 31.8 percent, to 2.59 million tonnes, in the January-May period, press reports said.\nA flood into Asia of European steel makers fleeing soft markets at home had increased the choice of quality products in China five-fold, the western source said.\nSteel stockpiles that had been mounting since the phenomenal buying of 1993 -- when 33 million tonnes of steel entered the country -- were slowly being whittled away, traders said.\nTotal 1994 imports were 22 million tonnes. In 1995, they were 15 million.\nJason Zheng, senior China and regional steel analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said he estimated China's steel stockpile at 30 million tonnes.\nThe quality was unknown, but doubtful and should not dent China's need for high quality product, he said.\nChina would probably import between 12 and 15 million tonnes of steel in 1996, trade and industry sources said.\n\"What they need is a quality they can't get at home,\" the western executive said.\nImports from the Commonwealth of Independent States were falling, Zheng said, \"because it is low quality stuff and if you only have 12 to 15 million tonnes of imports, you must have a higher quality product coming in\".\nHowever, the sources said China's steel market was weak and beset by a lack of cash for buyers -- and a rising incidence of contract washouts.\n\"Buyers are not willing to pay for their orders, not just because they don't have the cash, but because the price drops between order and delivery time and they are rejecting the cargoes or asking us to reduce the price,\" the Japanese executive said\nA source with another Japanese steelmaker said major Japanese mills had cut prices by 10 to 15 percent to hold on to their Chinese customers.\n\"So the obvious trend is that demand is not growing as the Japanese mills had expected and as a result they have a lot of surplus to push onto the market,\" he said.\n\"The problem is that even though China's state-owned manufacturers are trying to produce more, they are having problems getting hard currency to buy the raw materials.\"\n", "Farmers near Beijing marked the death of Deng Xiaoping quietly on Thursday, putting the hard task of making a living above memorials for the man whose reforms raised rural incomes dramatically.\nSome people in this rural county in municipal Beijing offered a private word of thanks to China's paramount leader, who helped steer the nation on a pragmatic course until his death at the age of 92 on Wednesday.\nSome shrugged and said they were more concerned with putting food on the family table, while others said they had not even heard the news.\n\"Is it true?\" asked one young man as he unloaded coal from a truck, heaping it beside a small hotel run by farmers who could no longer find work on the land.\n\"I hadn't heard this.

None of us had any money but now I have enough to get by with a little help from my sons,\" he said.\nThe one-time farmer said that in the 1950s Deng had visited a village not far from where he was standing and had expressed his disgust at the harsh conditions of rural life at that time.\n\"He at least was concerned with our welfare,\" said Zhao.\nBut some people said they were disappointed that incomes had not grown faster and expressed disdain for a surge in corruption unleashed by Deng's economic reforms.\n\"Deng may have been concerned for our welfare, but many local officials still exploit us,\" said a farmer named Du as he sold fruit at a roadside stall near an apple orchard he tended.\n\"The police always come along and chase us away and sometimes throw my apples on the ground,\" Du said.\n\"I may be better off now than I was but it is still hard to make a living,\" he said. \"We still have a long way to go.\"\n", "Summit Medical Systems Inc., said Monday its 1996 revenues will be \"substantially less\" than what it reported last week due to accounting discrepancies discovered by its new chief financial officer, who resigned after less than a week on the job.\nThe company, which makes computer-based information systems for the healthcare industry, said it expected to revise downward the $19.5 million in revenues it reported in 1996, and could also cut revenues for 1995 and 1994 as well.\nCompany officials were not available to comment.\nSummit's shares fell by $1.44, or 30 percent, to $3.31 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market.\nVolpe, Welty &amp; Co. analyst Chris Paul said Summit was believed to have about $40 million in cash and roughly 10.5 million shares.\n\"So it's trading below its cash value,\" he said.

It also posted a net loss for the year of $10.4 million, compared with a year-ago loss of $7.2 million.\nThe exact size of the adjustments to revenue and the years in which they apply will not be determined until an extensive audit is completed, the company said Monday.\nSummit said that Donald Haas, who joined the company as chief financial officer last Monday, resigned Saturday -- after informing management that some 1996 revenue had been incorrectly recognized.\nThe company said that Haas told management on Thursday, the day after the company reported its 1996 results, that it had incorrectly recognized revenue during 1996 in some circumstances.\nManagement immediately began a review of these issues, it added.\n\"The company's auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, have expanded the scope of their audit and are performing additional audit procedures based in part on the questions raised by Mr. Haas,\" Summit said in its statement.\nSummit added that it had retained the law firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP to investigate the matter with the assistance of independent accounting advice from Arthur Andersen LLP.\nThe company said it expected to announce corrected financial information by the end of March.\nThe likely downward revision of revenues for at least a year comes at a time when Summit is in the midst of a product transition, said Paul.\nThe transition, Paul explained, is to a single platform for Summit's computerized information system, which collects and analyzes patient data and likely outcomes.

But now, with deregulation, we have various options,\" he said.\nEven if a big Japanese bank merged with another big one, it would have few advantages in Japan because it is difficult to cut payrolls given Japan's social conventions, he said.\nSaeki added, however, that Sanwa may form alliances with foreign financial institutions in specialised areas such as overseas leveraged buy-outs and mergers and acquisitions.\nHe also said that Sanwa would seriously study the possibility of setting up a financial holding company following the expected lifting of Japan's ban on such companies as part of its deregulation drive.\n", "The Prague Stock Exchange, boosted by strong blue chip gains, hit a year-high on Thursday, but analysts said any strong bullish sentiment was tempered by a lack of liquidity and low foreign investor interest.\nAt the heart of the bourse's rise has been a resurgence of the market's two most-capitalised issues -- SPT Telecom and CEZ -- which account for over one-third of the PX50 index.\nBoth hits 52-week highs to push the index 1.93 percent higher to 591.3, but analysts cautioned that the market was still plagued by a lack of liquidity, which was distorting price movements.\n\"Volumes are very thin, when you come to the market looking for a bigger parcel of shares it doesn't take much interest to move the prices.

Industry sources say AFFC has the largest land bank in Hong Kong and has a HK$1.9 billion agreement with the Airport Authority for a 20 year sub-lease to build and operate the centre.\n- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017\n", "Russian natural gas giant Gazprom announced restructuring and cost-cutting plans on Tuesday, but the world's biggest gas producer downplayed discord with the government over its fate and said it would stay intact.\nGazprom board chairman Rem Vyakhirev said the company -- one of Russia's most powerful entities but increasingly under government scrutiny -- had mostly resolved a row with ministries and property officials over restructuring.\nHe told a news conference the firm would shed 100,000 jobs this year -- a massive 26 percent of the workforce.\nBut Vyakhirev said Gazprom would remain a monopoly and would not be split up.\n\"All of the internal blocs will remain within the Gazprom organisation,\" he said, referring to internal restructuring which would create up to half a dozen units within the monopoly for output, marketing, transport, finance and other issues.\nGazprom is one of Russia's most politically influential and well-connected companies, but it has come under attack by the International Monetary Fund and some government officials over its opaque financial books and strict control over access to its pipelines.\nBut Vyakhirev sought to paint a picture of accord between Gazprom and the government, whose prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, once headed Gazprom but who has been conspicuously absent from recent public debate over the company's fate.\nHe said that he, First Deputy Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov and Chernomrydin were all carrying out state duties in examining Gazprom activities.\n\"I think all four of us will reach agreement. I have a creed -- Russia and Gazprom are family. There will be no quarrels.\"\nVyakhirev, displaying none of the fear other executives show at the prospect of shedding jobs, said the leaner workforce would save Gazprom three trillion roubles ($520 million) a year.\nRussia accounts for 34 percent of world gas reserves and 27 percent of output; Gazprom produces nearly all of Russia's gas.\nAnalysts say that the company, which was once an entire ministry, is immensely rich from exports -- heating about one third of Europe -- but that it faces serious problems in collecting debts in the former Soviet Union for unpaid supplies.\nEven the profit figures are open to doubt.\n\"When we worked with our auditors (Price Waterhouse), we saw our profits weren't accurately reflected, that our expenditures didn't always have something to do with output,\" Vyakhirev said.\n\"There are many unnecessary expenditures. We're cleaning out all our basic production spheres -- that means getting rid of anything that we don't need.\"\nBut he said Gazprom was rich enough to pay seven trillion roubles ($1.2 billion) to state coffers by June 10 to help President Boris Yeltsin meet a promise to pay pension arrears.\nNemtsov has put Gazprom's debts to the federal budget at a whopping 14.8 trillion roubles ($2.6 billion), while Gazprom says it is owed a dizzying 64 trillion roubles ($11.2 billion).\nThe state has a 40 percent stake in Gazprom, seven eighths of it personally managed in trust by Vyakhirev. Last week, after a row between Vyakhirev and ministers, Privatisation Minister Alfred Kokh said the government would review the arrangement.\nGovernment officials said this week they had lost the document outlining the deal. Vyakhirev said they later found it and that the scheme would stay, but with some changes.\nNemtsov, a reformer entrusted with restructuring Russia's natural monopolies, including Gazprom, has long said the monopoly will not be broken up into separate output and transport companies. \"Only a nut would destroy Gazprom,\" Nemtsov was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.\nThe company operates a strict separation between its domestically-traded shares and those covered by its ADSs in London.\nGazprom was trading at $0.665 on the Russian Trading System at 1230 GMT versus $0.620 on Monday. The ADSs, covering 10 underlying shares, were at $16.45 in London versus Monday's close of $16.30.\n", "Shares in British drugs company Zeneca Group Plc had another busy day on Friday as the bid rumour mill again started churning, overshadowing a key patent victory in the United States.\nZeneca shares climbed 35 pence to 18.55 pounds ($30.06) in late afternoon trading after a U.S. Appeals Court threw out a patent challenge to one of its top-selling drugs, breast cancer treatment Nolvadex.\nThe ruling, which follows a U.S. district court decision in Zeneca's favour a year ago, means that Canadian generic drug maker Novopharm Ltd will not be able to market a generic version of Nolvadex before Zeneca's patent runs out in 2002.\nBut analysts said the ruling was widely expected and pointed the finger instead at the Swiss magazine Cash for driving up Zeneca's shares.\nCash said Swiss giant Roche Holdings AG was about to announce an agreed takeover of the British group.\nStephen Putnam, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: \"I think this rise has more to do with rumours about a Roche bid. I can't believe anybody thought there would be a different outcome (to the Novopharm appeal).\"\nIn an unsourced article, Cash said Roche was planing to offer between 21 and 22 pounds per share for Zeneca, which it would then break up, selling off the agricultural chemical and specialty seeds divisions as well as Roche's own fragrances and aromas division.\nBoth companies, increasingly weary of the mounting bid speculation, again declined to comment. But London analysts laughed the suggestion out of court.\n\"Frankly, for 21 pounds they'd be lucky to get the agricultural chemicals division. I think the bidding would start at 30 pounds,\" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. \"Zeneca is not interested and doesn't need to embark on a merger,\" he added.\nZeneca's patent victory against Novopharm has, however, strengthened its main attraction for any possible bidder -- its strong product portfolio.\nNolvadex is the world's top-selling breast cancer treatment, with sales of 2.7 billion pounds since its launch. Last year Zeneca sold 332 million pounds worth of Nolvadex, making it one of its biggest money spinners.\nZeneca began legal action against Novopharm in January 1995 after the Canadian company tried to get U.S. regulatory approval for a generic version of Nolvadex, also known as Tamoxifen Citrate.\nTwo other patent challenges for Nolvadex in the U.S, against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc and Pharmachemie BV, are outstanding. A third, against Lemmon Co, was dropped after Lemmon withdrew its marketing application.\nKevin Scotcher, analyst at NatWest Markets, said Zeneca's patent position was now much more secure as a result of the Novopharm ruling. \"This case must strengthen their hand significantly in those other cases,\" he said.\nNovopharm has been very active in legal challenges recently, last week successfully winning the right to market a generic version of one of the world's biggest-selling drugs, Glaxo Wellcome Plc's Zantac, from July.\n", "Tigers ready to pounce or a litter of clawless wannabes?\nSurrounded by the burgeoning states of Asia, Hong Kong is wondering just how long it can rely upon its traditional strengths -- proximity to China, developed markets, a huge and free port -- for prosperity into the next millennium.\nRival tiger states from Singapore to Jakarta are sharpening their claws and developing fast, preparing for China's arrival.\nThey are growing so fast that financial powerhouse Hong Kong has started to wonder how well-prepared it is to defend its position as China's primary financial service centre.\nAn inadequate education system, declining standards of English, rising costs and an under-skilled labour force are just some of the hurdles facing Hong Kong -- and grabbing the attention of some of Asia's youngest and fiercest tigers.\nTIGERS UNSHEATH THEIR CLAWS\nTokyo and Singapore pose the most immediate threat.\nTokyo's loss of business to lower cost, less regulated rivals such as Hong Kong and Singapore was one of the key motivations for the shake-out now hitting Japan's financial sector, termed the Big Bang.\nMany of the reforms will take effect before the 2001 deadline, allowing Tokyo to claw back business from Hong Kong's grasp - but the process could take a while, analysts said.\n\"Immediate gains may not be so large,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, head of economic research at LTCB Research Institute Inc.\nDespite Tokyo's obvious size and strength, Singapore is considered the Asian tiger with the sharpest teeth -- and time is on its side.\n\"Tokyo is still in the early stage of its liberalisation program,\" said Eddie Lee, economist at Vickers Ballas in Singapore. \"And in five to 10 years time, Singapore would have an earlier foothold in the Chinese market. The Japanese at this point are still trying to sort out their balance sheets. We'll have an advantage.\"\nThe city-state has already lured many Asian headquarters from Hong Kong either directly, or by luring those companies that might previously more naturally have gone to Hong Kong.\nBut Singapore should not get too complacent. Lurking on the horizon lies tiger cub Kuala Lumpur, one of Asia's most promising and aggressive financial centres.\nMalaysia's political stability, plentiful cheap office space and political will to deregulate financial markets are attractive for multinationals seeking an Asian location.\nMalaysia is cheap, dynamic and motivated, with rentals one-third of those in Singapore and one-quarter of Hong Kong's.\n\"It's very obvious that the infrastructure is being put in place, put in place very rapidly,\" said Patrick Tan, assistant director at ABN Amro Hoare Govett in Kuala Lumpur.\n\"Right now we're number three (behind Hong Kong and Singapore) but it's a question of time and momentum. It's not a question of how many years but more a question how fast - what sort of volume can be built up in the next couple of years.\"\nEven Taipei, undeterred by political awkwardness with China, will be watching Hong Kong carefully over the coming months and years for signs of a loss of openness and evenhandedness.\nAnd Jakarta is working hard to build its role as an Asian middleman for international investors.\n\"Our investment banking industry is growing at the moment and investment banks from the United Kingdom and the U.S. are coming here,\" said Agung Prabowo, analyst with Indonesia's state-owned brokerage PT Danareksa Sekuritas.\n\"We do play a middleman role that can facilitate the new ideas or debt securities or equity securities, and there are investors here as well who can absorb new issuance.\"\nHONG KONG THREAT WITHIN NOT WITHOUT\nDespite all the enthusiasm, economists warn that China's smooth economic emergence should not be taken for granted.\nGrowth rates in China are declining as the nation grapples with massive structural problems.\nAnd the sort of problems afflicting Hong Kong also weigh on other regional centres.\n\"Hong Kong's probably got more or as many well-qualified people as anywhere else in the region, and also, this economy has managed to adapt itself very well over the years,\" said Simon Ogus, economist at SBC Warburg in Hong Kong.\nThe greatest threat to Hong Kong comes not from outside but within, Ogus warned.\n\"The key question for Hong Kong is: does the underlying legal regulatory structure under which that (China) business is conducted change. In which case, there will be a loss of competitiveness relative to other countries,\" Ogus said.\n", "Hong Kong's business and political leaders are gearing up to face a tough new world when the handover party is over.\nSurrounded by rival Asian tiger economies, the territory can no longer rely on its historic role as the outside world's gateway to China to maintain its position as the world's seventh biggest trading economy.\n\"Our economic challenge is to improve Hong Kong's competitiveness in the new world order,\" future chief executive Tung Chee-hwa said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.\nA quick glance at rivals Singapore, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo has convinced Hong Kong's new leaders that drastic action is necessary.\nTung said Hong Kong had to become \"more compassionate and caring\" and tackle problems in education, housing and care of the elderly.\n\"Only if we succeed in meeting these challenges can we sustain our economic vitality and thereby continue to create wealth and improve the quality of life of all the people of Hong Kong,\" he declared.\n\"LIVELIHOOD\" ISSUES AT THE FOREFRONT\nTung's blend of economic and social policy into \"livelihood\" issues masks controversy over the prospect of government intervention in an economy dubbed the world's freest.\nWith a cash pile of HK$330 billion (US$42 billion) in reserves, Tung and his advisers have plenty of ammunition to fire at improvement targets.\nEasy access to the cheap labour regions of southern China allowed Hong Kong's manufacturing base to explode and multiply when China opened its doors to foreign investment in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nOnce a manufacturing base dependent on exports of labour-intensive, low-value goods, Hong Kong has been transformed into a service centre geared to China's emergence.\nManufacturing's contribution to Hong Kong's gross domestic product has plunged to single digits from more than 50 percent in the 1970s. Meanwhile, services have soared to 85 percent of GDP and are rising.\nThe speed of this process has amazed economists around the world -- and has created a new set of challenges for Hong Kong.\nWAGES, PROPERTY CRUSH\nThe most obvious is a shortage of skilled workers.\n\"We need people, not machinery,\" George Leung, economic adviser at Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, said. \"This is the most serious issue in Hong Kong.\"\nWage rates are rising, putting pressure on inflation rates even while unemployment rises -- a new phenomenon.\nDemand is switching from high-labour, low-skilled jobs to white-collar occupations such as accountants, lawyers, managers and investment bankers.\nThe education system is ill-suited. Business leaders have called for government action to address a shortage of schools and properly qualified teachers.\n\"It's not a question of dumping money at the problem,\" Leung said. \"We need to come up with a helpful programme to train people and raise their quality. Otherwise, we will have no resources to expand our economy.\"\nWith China's economy expected to double within the decade, Leung believes Hong Kong could face critical labour shortages in the next 10 years unless it acts aggressively now.\nRivals Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Tokyo are waiting to pounce on failure.\nTung has appointed one adviser to draw up a detailed education policy and asked another for guidance on how to tackle Hong Kong's critical property shortage.\nBoth wages and property make a major contribution to high costs, Hong Kong's major handicap in the competitiveness stakes. Rents and wages are higher than virtually anywhere else in Asia.\n", "Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi received on Friday an honorary doctorate in absentia from Prague's Charles University in a show of Czech solidarity with Burma's democrats.\nThe Nobel laureate's husband, British professor Michael Aris, accepted the honour for Suu Kyi who has been largely confined to her house and told by military rulers that if she left Burma she would not be permitted to return.\nThe six-centuries-old Czech university awarded the Doctor of Law degree on the 20th anniversary of Prague's Charter 77 human rights declaration, for Suu Kyi's \"active participation in the fight for democracy, freedom and human rights\".\nIn a speech read by Aris, Suu Kyi said that the fight of her National League for Democracy (NLD) was \"a struggle that knows little respite.\"\nShe said that Prague's 1989 bloodless \"gentle revolution\" over communism, which was in large part inspired by the Charter, formed a special bond with Burma's democracy campaigners and \"provided hope and practical lessons\".\n\"An idea whose time has come cannot be crushed,\" she said.\nSuu Kyi's NLD won a landslide victory in a 1990 election, but has never taken power because the military government rejected the results of the poll.\nIn commemorating Burma's 49th anniversary of independence from Britain last week, Suu Kyi vowed to step up her efforts to bring democracy to Burma despite restrictions on her and her supporters.\nIn December, troops and riot police used water cannon and batons to force thousands of student demonstrators off the streets in the biggest anti-government demonstrations seen since national protests in 1988.\nCzech President Vaclav Havel, a former dissident against communism who helped forge the Charter and led the 1989 democratic revolution, promised \"support and solidarity\" to Burma's democrats, in a statement read at the ceremony.\nIn the speech read by Aris, Suu Kyi said that like the Czech democrats, who were ignored by the top communist rulers until the revolution, Burma's democracy campaign was mired in \"a one-sided dialogue with police and security forces\".\nAris said that Suu Kyi's speech was delivered to him from Burma with great difficulty.\n", "There will be many more places to hang your hat in cyberspace soon, thanks to a plan adopted by the Internet Society and a host of other groups, the society announced Tuesday.\nThe group, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, said the plan would provide seven new top-level domains, the last three letters at the end of every electronic mail or Web site address.\nComputer maker Digital Equipment Corp., telecommunications company MCI Communications Corp. and UUNET Technologies Inc., a unit of Worldcom Inc., endorsed the plan, first unveiled in February, the society said.\nThe plan also has been endorsed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards operating under a charter from the society and the Federal Network Council.\nThe International Telecommunications Union, World Intellectual Property Organisation and International Trademark Association backed the plan as well, the society said.\nUnder the plan, new domain names such as \"firm,\" \"arts,\" and \"web\" will be added to the existing top-level domains such as \"com,\" \"net,\" and \"org\" starting in the third quarter of 1997, the society said.\nThe plan establishes an arbitration and mediation procedure for resolving disputes over names, such as when a trademarked name is used in an Internet address.\nLast year, for example, toymaker Hasbro Inc. won a lawsuit to regain control of the address \"candyland.com,\" which was being used for an adult Web site with nude photographs. But more complex disputes arise when both parties may have a legitimate claim to an address name.\n\"Responsible self-governance is the key factor in assuring that the Internet will reach its fullest potential,\" Internet Society President Donald Heath said.\nAlthough other groups have tried to establish alternate domain names, they have not succeeded in persuading the vast majority of Internet service providers to add their new names to the computers that route information across the network.\nThe Internet Society plan met the needs of major providers.\n\"The Internet is growing up rapidly and it is vital that the processes, procedures and policies that define its adminstration be sound, stable and sustainable in an international setting,\" MCI Senior Vice President Vincent Cerf said.\nMCI is a top operator of the Internet's backbone network.\nCurrently, one company, Network Solutions Inc., registers addresses under most existing top-level domains under a contract with the National Science Foundation. Under the plan, up to 28 new registration agents will be chosen in a process overseen by the Big Six accounting firm Arthur Andersen.\nBut Network Solutions Senior Vice President Don Telage said having so many registrars would create chaos on the Net.\n\"This plan risks the stability of the Internet,\" he said.\nThe current system functions \"pretty well\" without international arbitration procedures, Telage said, noting his company has registered 1.2 million addresses and been sued only 26 times.\nHerndon, Va.-based Network Solutions will come out with its own plan soon for reforming the domain name registration system, Telage added.\nWhile Network Solutions charges $100 for a two-year registration, the new firms will be free to compete on price. All names will be maintained in a central, shared database.\nOnce Network Solution's contract with the National Science Foundation expires, the top-level domains it registers will be opened to all the other registry agents.\nA broad range of Internet companies and organisations will gather in Geneva at the end of April to add their formal endorsements on a memorandum of understanding, Heath said.\n", "Chinese police have arrested the suspected ringleader of a riot in the mainly Moslem northwestern region of Xinjiang last week that left at least 10 people dead and 144 injured, local officials said on Wednesday.\nAbudu Heilili, 29, of the Uighur ethnic minority, was in police custody and under interrogation following the riot last Wednesday and Thursday in Yining near China's border with Kazakhstan, said a local Communist Party committee official.\nThe suspect was unemployed, and was a ringleader of a less violent anti-Chinese demonstration in Yining in August 1995, the official told Reuters by telephone.\nHeilili had been released after that demonstration following \"ideological education\" -- a codeword for political indoctrination, he said.\nPolice rounded up 200 to 300 people after last week's riot, in which at least 10 people were killed and 144 injured. Many suspects had been released after questioning, officials said.\nThe death toll could rise, with up to seven people listed as missing, the party official said. About 90 people were treated for head wounds, and more than 10 were still in hospital.\nOf the injured, 132 were civilians while the remaining 12 were members of the paramilitary People's Armed Police, a spokesman for the Xinjiang regional government said by telephone from Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital.\nAuthorities had issued circulars calling on local officials to deal a blow to separatism in the frontier region and warning of severe punishment for last week's rioters.\n\"We are resolved to deal a blow to the handful of ethnic separatist elements,\" said Zhang Youlian, deputy director of foreign affairs office for the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, that administers Yining.\nAbout 1,000 people, mostly Uighur farmers or unemployed young men, rioted in Yining last week in one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover.\nTurkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority in Xinjiang, where ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.\n\"We don't want the Communist Party,\" the demonstrators had chanted, witnesses said.\nUighur demonstrators had attacked Han Chinese with bricks, clubs and knives, and rampaged through the town, smashing and setting fire to about 20 vehicles and looting shops.\nThe People's Armed Police only succeeded in dispersing the rioters a day later, firing teargas to break up the crowd.\nAuthorities had sealed off Yining, an after-dark curfew was in force in some districts and armed police still patrolled the streets. The airport would reopen on Friday, officials said.\nA Chinese source said the riot erupted after a Uighur criminal suspect resisted arrest by police.\nYusupbek Mukhlisi, leader of the United National Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan based in Kazakhstan, said the riot was sparked by the execution of 30 Uighurs in China last week. Chinese officials dismissed the report.\nYining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.\nXinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\nLast May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's lengthy border to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states.\n", "Australian appliance, packaging and wine group Southcorp Holdings Ltd on Tuesday reported a 22.3 percent rise in first half net profit and tipped a record result for the year to June 30.\nSouthcorp posted a net profit after abnormals of A$64.92 million for the six months ended December 31, 1996, compared with A$52.36 million a year earlier.\n\"We are now on track to meet our year-end forecast and our year-end forecast is broadly in line with market expectations,\" chief executive officer Graham Kraehe told reporters.  \nKraehe said market expectations were around A$130 million net profit before abnormals. Southcorp reported a net profit of A$124.22 million in 1995/96, which included a record second half profit of A$64.3 million.\n\"Each business, we expect, in the full year, as they have in the last two periods, to grow earnings over the corresponding period,\" he said.\nKraehe said the forecasts were dependent on there being no significant downturn in the Australian economy.\n\"On that basis, we are very confident that 1996/97 will be another record year for Southcorp.\"  \nThe December 1996 half results showed a profit improvement for all three divisions, with its appliance division growing the strongest despite lower sales.\nKraehe said in a statement the strong appliance division result reflected cost cuts and better productivity, supported by the launch of a range of new whitegoods products.\nBut its American Water Heater business, formerly called Mor-Flo, continued to make losses although they were half of the A$2.1 million loss in the June 1996 period.\nGroup sales fell 0.5 percent to A$1.30 billion in the first half and dividends were steady at 8.25 cents a share.  \nKraehe said Southcorp was still on the prowl for more acquisitions in the wine business, particularly in overseas markets, and also add-on acquisitions in packaging.\n\"For acquisitions, we are looking at, internationally in wine and in areas in packaging, which add on to our core businesses, either in Australia, North America or Asia.\"\n\"We are also looking at some Asian development, which will essentially be greenfield development,\" Kraehe said.\nSouthcorp is currently building a manufacturing plant in Dalian, China, to make steel and aluminium cans.  \n\"Whatever we do (in wine), if it is in Australia or if it is something offshore, the end result is that it is going to be able to better serve the international markets, that says that the probability is that it (acquisition) is going to be offshore,\" Kraehe said.\n\"In Australia our primary focus is to continue to invest in our our strong vineyard and winery facilities...with a heavy focus on red (wine),\" he said.\nSouthcorp made two wine acqusitions in Australia in 1996 but had no plans to raise new funds for any more purchases.  \n\"Our gearing has come down to a pretty comfortable level, if we wanted to do something major, particularly something major in wine, that could cause us to look at means of raising capital,\" Kraehe said.\n\"But generally speaking we could fund an acquisition and development programmes within our existing cash flow,\" he said.\nSouthcorp's net debt to equity fell to 63.7 percent in the December half, from 72.1 percent a year earlier.\nSouthcorp shares closed steady at A$4.56.

All of the prices include a $525 destination charge.\nFor 1997, the vehicle gets a new instrument panel with dual air bags, updated sheet metal and a redesigned grille.\nBut the Cherokee retains much the same squared-off look it had when it became the industry's first compact, four-door sport utility vehicle as a 1984 model.\nChrysler said it has the capacity to build about 150,000 Cherokees annually at its Toledo, Ohio, assembly plant.

The 1997 Viper GTS coupe comes with standard monochromatic red paint.\nSeparately, Chrysler increased cash incentives on two 1996-model versions of its full-size vans, effective immediately through April 7, 1997.\nChrysler said the cash rebate on the 1996 Dodge Ram Wagon was increased to $1,500 from $1,200, while the rebate on the 1996 Dodge Ram Van Conversion was raised to $2,000 from $1,600.\n", "The British government warned on Friday it would refer the proposed transatlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions.\nTrade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions are met by both airlines, final clearance will hinge on an open skies deal being signed between Britain and the United States to liberalise transatlantic air traffic -- securing greater competition on the routes.\nLang backed the undertakings proposed by competition watchdog the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which was asked to re-examine the case last month.\n\"I agree...that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers, on those routes where BA and AA (American) currently compete and for all passengers on the transatlantic market route between the UK and U.S.,\" he said.\nThe comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London, with no deal signed. Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the BA/American deal would be cleared.\nBoth BA and American were forming a response to the news and were unavailable to give an immmediate reaction.\nThe conditions for clearance of the alliance are that BA and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport, the busiest in Europe.\nBA's initial response late on Friday was that \"unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value\". It added that it would be \"prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition\".\nThe government also wants BA to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir which bars it from competing on transatlantic routes.\nAlso, both BA and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter, because the OFT felt that competition on this route would be hampered by an alliance.\nIt also suggested losing some slots on the London to Boston route. The OFT has called for BA/American to allow third party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent scheme. Lang said responses should be made to the OFT by January 10 1997.\nRichard Hannah, analyst at UBS, said: \"There are only three obstacles to the deal -- one is the OFT conditions, two is the open skies pact and three is the anti-trust threat in the States. I would be surprised if a deal cannot be done.\"\nBut Will Whitehorn, spokesman for Virgin Atlantic Airways, a major rival on the UK-U.S. route, said \"I don't think they will be able to meet these conditions. I think it will go to the MMC,\" adding: \"Even if they complied with the conditions the alliance would still be anti-competitive.\"\nOn the open skies talks, he said that by linking the deal's clearance to an open skies pact, the British government was using its leverage to try and gain reciprocal access for British carriers into the restricted U.S. internal market. United Airlines also welcomed the OFT conditions to the deal.\nThe current aviation agreement, dating back to March 1991, restricts transatlantic access to Heathrow to BA, American, Virgin Atlantic Airways and United Airlines.\nThe DOT has refused to comment on whether it will now be seeking to set a date for new open skies talks in light of the OFT stipulation that alliance clearance hinges on open skies.\nUnder the BA/American alliance, BA would coordinate its 244 flights a week to 22 U.S. destinations with American's 238 flights from seven U.S. airports to 12 European destinations.\n", "Intel Corp. will release its speedy new Pentium II microprocessor this week, but a glitch in the computer chip that turned up Monday could mar the launch.\nThe world's biggest chip maker plans to roll out the new microprocessor -- the heart of the personal computer -- Wednesday, and about a dozen personal computer makers will announce they plan to use it, said Richard Dracott, Intel marketing manager.\nIntel officials said they were looking into reports the chips may contain a so-called floating point glitch that could cause computational errors. A similar problem bedeviled the original Pentium chip in 1994.\nA spokesman for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip supplier said the problem appears to crop up when a computer performs an obscure calculation. The company said engineers were running tests on the chips to determine the extent of the problem but at this time Intel has no plans to recall them.\nThe problem appeared to affect only the Pentium II and Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro chips. It was not immediately clear how many chips may be affected by the problem.\nNews of the problem, which was posted on a Web site called \"Intel Secrets\" (http://www.x86.org) and reported by CMP Media's EE Times Online (http://techweb.cmp.com/eet/823), cropped up just as Intel was preparing to launch the Pentium II on Wednesday.\nAnalysts said it was not clear if the flaw is as as serious as one which cost the semiconductor giant $475 million in 1994.\n\"It does not strike me right now as as big a problem as a couple years ago,\" Dataquest analyst Nathan Brookwood said, adding the problem would crop up in poorly written computer programs that store decimal numbers in a certain way.\nThe Pentium II is based on the Pentium Pro, but includes software and circuitry -- dubbed MMX technology -- that makes it more adept at handling graphics. In most cases, it works 30 percent to 40 percent faster than today's mainstream Intel products, analysts said.\nMost of the new Pentium II machines will be desktop PCs aimed at engineers and professionals who use a lot of computing horsepower for graphics, analysts said.\nAlthough the Pentium II is a souped-up version of the Pentium Pro, it is the biggest product introduction for Intel in years, said Mark Kirstein, research director at semiconductor market researcher In-Stat in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\"The Pentium Pro was really a niche product\" for high-end desktops and servers, the computers that control networks, Kirstein said. \"The Pentium II is aimed at the mainstream.\"\nA streamlined design and cheaper production will make it easier for Intel to churn out the new chip, Kirstein said.\nWithin a year, most new PCs -- even the ones geared for home use -- will be based on the Pentium II, analysts said.\nIntel also is trying to pitch the chip to new kinds of customers. The company has told video game makers, for example, that the chip can handle the intense graphics requirements of coin-operated arcade games.\n\"We will be delivering significant performance improvement over the fastest Pentium Pro,\" Dracott said.\nIntel said part of the performance improvement comes from a new so-called cartridge design. The Pentium II will be sold to PC manufacturers in a plastic housing that includes specialized memory chips. Because the microprocessor and memory chips are packed closely together on a seperate circuit board, they can pump data to the rest of the PC much faster, Intel said.\nThere is one more benefit: It frustrates Intel rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp., which for the first time are a credible threat to Intel.\nAMD and Cyrix make chips that work like the Pentium and sell them to PC makers for much less. But their chips are designed to fit into the old slots for microprocessors.\nAMD spent the past two years working on the K6 chip, which works as fast as the Pentium Pro and is 25 percent cheaper, but does not fit into the new cartridge slot.\nSince most of the PC makers are expected to use Intel's cartridge design, AMD now has to spend time and money to make the K6 compatible.\nIntel stock rose $4.875 to $162.50 Monday while Cyrix rose $1 to $22.50, both on Nasdaq. Advanced Micro Devices rose 50 cents to $44.50 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "Mounting concerns about the loss of both two top executives and an equity stake in terrestrial digital TV sent shares in pay-television giant BSkyB diving further on Monday and analysts forecasts more weakness to come.\nAround 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) has been wiped off the value of British Sky Broadcasting since last week and some analysts said the shares, which fell 14.5p to 483p in afternoon trade, could tumble to 350p.\n\"There has quite clearly been a re-rating in the last week and I think it's going to continue,\" said Jason Crisp, media analyst at brokers SocGen.\nAnother broker said only in \"wildly optimistic\" cases could the shares be valued even at 450p.\nNegative weekend newspaper reports helped compound last week's share falls sparked by a report in the Financial Times that BSkyB could be shut out of the bidding for new digital TV licences, experts said.\nThe Financial Times reported last week the television watchdog, the Independent Television Commission, had told BSkyB it should drop its one-third stake in a consortium with commercial TV groups Carlton Communications and Granada Group.\nBSkyB was enjoying an effective monopoly on pay- television and the watchdog was concerned about market domination, the FT said.\nThe report, which remains unconfirmed, followed last week's announcement that BSkyB's respected chief executive Sam Chisolm was stepping down and deputy managing director David Chance was becoming a consultant.\nSocGen's Crisp said the stock, which had hit an intraday 1997 high of 669p on February 14, had been vastly over-rated and should be trading nearer 400p.\nHe noted apart from the possible loss of its equity stake in its digital terrestrial TV consortium, called British Digital Broadcasting, and the loss of two very talented and experienced staff, flat satellite dish sales and rising operating costs were hitting the shares.\n\"All these things make you think it should be on a more typical PE (price earnings ratio) multiple of other big media companies,\" he added.\nAt 400p, the stock would have a more reasonable PE of 22 times next year, compared to one nearer 30 times before the share correction, Tysoe said.\nCredit Suisse First Boston was even more negative. \"We'd just re-iterate from our call last week that fundamental value on BSkyB is about 450p even in wildly optimistic cases, about 350-400p in more reasoned scenarios,\" it stated in a note.\nBut Mike Woodcock, media analyst at Nikko, said the share price fall had been overdone and he would recommend buying the shares under five pounds.\nHe said that in the short-term, the news on BDB, a business he valued at around 400 million pounds, was positive from a financial point of view.\nCompensation is tipped by the Financial Times at 75 million pounds. BSkyB can also keep some 100 million pounds which it was going to invest in the joint venture.\n\"Is the news of BDB and Sam Chisolm stepping down enough to warrant 1.7 billion pounds being wiped from the value of BSkyB? I would say no,\" Woodcock said. \"The real benefits for BSkyB are in the provision of programming rather than in the equity stake.\"\nBut he said as traditionally high operating margins were squeezed -- partly because payments to show English Premier League soccer are set to rise to 160 million pounds per year from August -- he was expecting flat pre-tax profits of 309 million pounds in 1998 and 1997.\nOther longer-term concerns, he said, were about how independent BSkyB was from media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, its leading shareholder -- and how much News Corp would benefit from the success of the pay-television giant.\nThe ITC hopes to decide by the end of this month on whether to award digital terrestrial television licences to BDB or a rival consortium run by cable and broadcast group NTL Inc.\n", "Interest rates on British home loans may rise this year due to upward pressure on savings rates, even if a new government does not immediately tighten monetary policy, analysts said on Thursday.\nThis is a separate issue from the question of whether the government should raise interest rates to nip inflation in the bud after the general election on May 1, they said.\nThe flotation of four building societies and the takeover of another will free as much as 140 billion pounds ($225 billion) of savings locked in nearly 30 million accounts in the societies, which provide home mortages.\nThis is around 25 percent of British retail savings and analysts expect a good proportion of this to be moved.\n\"I expect 15 billion pounds to be moved as a conservative estimate,\" said UBS building societies analyst Rob Thomas. \"The effect will be to push up savings rates and, since mortgage lending is largely funded from savings, mortgage margins will come under pressure and rates may rise.\"\nHalifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender with 20 percent of the market; Woolwich ; Alliance &amp; Leicester and Northern Rock are ending their mutual society status and floating on the stock market.\nSavers had to deposit money in these building societies to qualify for free shares. But once the societies have floated, savers can move their money where they want.\nThe societies will have to fight hard to keep hold of the money as other institutions such as Abbey National and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, part of the Lloyds TSB Group want to grab a big chunk of the cash.\nAnalysts expect a fair proportion of the money to flow into pure spending or to other financial products such as unit trusts. But they also expect a large amount to be up for grabs within the savings and loan industry.\nOn Wednesday, Abbey National, which converted to bank status and floated in 1990, pointedly noted that much of the money can already be moved as members have already qualified for shares.\nThe Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, proclaiming its continued mutual ownership, said it would effectively raise savings rates and cut mortgage rates.\nThomas of UBS said the spread between mortgage rates and base rated was low historically following mortgage rate cuts in 1995 which outstripped an easing base rate.\nPressure on savings rates could trigger a rise for borrowers if institutions want to maintain margin which has already been difficult to do. \"This might even result in a round of mortgage rate rises not associated with a base rate rise,\" Thomas said.\nDavid Poutney, banking analyst at Panmure Gordon expects the situation to be an opportunity for banks such as Abbey National. \"While competitive pressure will increase, the freeing up of the market will increase new business opportunities for the likes of the Abbey,\" he said.

From what the (Chinese) Communist Party has done in the past, it's worrying to these people.\"\nThe Alliance, which China has branded as subversive, has helped scores of Chinese dissidents in exile in Hong Kong find sanctuary in third countries before the British-run territory reverts to China just 27 days from now.\n\"Many left this year. Nineteen left last week,\" Lau said.\nMany fled to Hong Kong in the aftermath of the bloody military crackdown on student activists in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989. But Lau said he was confident those remaining would be able to leave before July 1.\n\"We are very confident those eligible for political refugee status will be able to leave. Even the Hong Kong government wants them to leave...it is helping them,\" Lau said.\nAnxieties over the future of Chinese dissidents in Hong Kong mounted as the territory's activists prepared to mourn hundreds, possibly thousands, of victims in China's anti-democracy crackdown, eight years ago to the day.\nUp to 40,000 people were expected to attend a candlelit vigil in Hong Kong where organisers will demand a reversal of China's \"counter-revolutionary\" label on the crushed 1989 movement and the release of political prisoners in the country.\nOne mainlander, Zhang Taisong, had threatened to set himself on fire at the rally to force the Hong Kong government to quicken the exit of remaining dissidents, the Chinese-language newspaper Apple Daily said on Wednesday.\nWorries were aggravated this week after Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa said Chinese dissidents who entered the territory illegally cannot stay after the handover.\nTung, who was selected in December to become Hong Kong's first leader under Beijing's auspices, said only those who entered legally and with unlimited stay could continue to live in the territory.\nDemocratic Party legislator Cheung Man-kwong, also a member of the Alliance, warned that the dissidents could be in danger if they were forced to return to China after the handover.\n\"If they are forced to leave Hong Kong, it's very dangerous because they are political dissidents. If they go back to China, China will put them in jail,\" Cheung said.\nProminent Chinese dissident Chai Ling, a leader of the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement, voiced concern over the future of post-handover freedoms when she visited Hong Kong last month.\nChai, now studying at Harvard University in the United States, also urged Hong Kong people to defend their freedoms. Visits like hers might become a thing of the past after July 1.\nTung has announced plans to trim back civil liberties, ban overseas funding for political groups and require police permits for activists to stage protests.\n", "China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is in good health, but may not be able to visit Hong Kong when the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in mid-1997, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa said on Monday.\n\"To my knowledge, (his health) is very good,\" Zhang told reporters when asked about Deng's health at a reception for diplomats and foreign journalists in Beijing.\nZhang, who is believed to be close to the Deng family, said he had not recently visited the 92-year-old architect of China's sweeping economic reforms, but said Deng was in Beijing.\nAsked if Deng would visit Hong Kong for the ceremony when Beijing resumes sovereignty over the British colony at midnight on June 30, 1997, Zhang said: \"He said it himself -- he will go to Hong Kong even it means in a wheelchair.\"\nBut Zhang added: \"It would be difficult for him to go now. It would be disastrous for an old man in his 90s to catch cold. Catching cold would be a serious illness.\"\nDeng oversaw the negotiations that successfully concluded in an agreement for Britain to hand back the territory it has held for 150 years. He has said repeatedly he hoped to be able to witness the historic transfer of power.\nChinese officials have said privately that Deng would not attend the handover ceremony, where his anointed successor President Jiang Zemin is expected to hold the limelight, but they hoped he would be able to visit Hong Kong afterwards.\nThe man who launched China's sweeping market-oriented economic reforms in 1978 and guided the nation's policies during the 1980s and into the early 1990s no longer holds public office but remains highly influential.\nHe has not been seen in public since early 1994 when he toured Shanghai during Chinese Lunar New Year festivities and appeared frail and halting in his movements and had difficulty speaking.\nDeng's health is a matter of intense speculation in China and in neighbouring countries because his death is expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as the de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.\nBut analysts say that his death has largely been discounted and rumours of his ill-health that just 18 months ago sent Asian markets into a tailspin now generate little more than a murmur.\nDeng is said to be suffering from Parkinson's disease. It is believed that he rarely leaves his closely-guarded home in a courtyard in central Beijing just behind the Forbidden City where China's emperors had ruled for centuries. Beijing has clamped an effective blackout on news about the health of the man who guided China out of the years of radical revolution espoused by Mao, dismantled much of 40 years of Stalinist-style central planning and told Chinese that \"to get rich is glorious\".\nOfficials routinely decline to answer questions about Deng's health, giving the party line that: \"He is as well as can be expected for a man of his age.\"\nHowever, sources close to the family say Deng is losing his ability to walk and is believed to spend most of his time in a wheelchair.\n", "Ivorian coffee exports are set to rise in late February after world price increases but poor quality could mean only 150,000 tonnes of the 1996/97 season's crop is marketed, industry sources say.\n\"I really cannot see much more than 150,000 tonnes being exportable this year,\" one port quality analyst told Reuters.\nIndustry sources expect exports to take off before March.\n\"There are a good number of shipments for late February,\" a San Pedro-based exporter said. \"People are waking up because of the prices but exports now are still minimal.\"\nExisting contracts would sustain export volumes into March and April, he added. \"The rest (of 1996/97 exports) depends on which way the dollar moves,\" he said.\nIvory Coast opened its 1996/97 coffee season on November 14, delayed from around October 1, in an attempt to set guide farmgate prices closer to then plummeting world spot rates.\nUpcountry buying and exports were minimal in late 1996 as bankers were reluctant to fund coffee buying and put up export guarantees as world prices and local bean quality crashed.\nUpcountry buyers said farmers had taken little care over selecting beans during late 1996 harvesting. Subsequent rains and long storage had led to deterioration and slowed down sorting.\n\"For every 500 tonnes of grade two coffee exported you need to sift 1,000 tonnes,\" said one forwarder in Abidjan.\nArrivals by early February are estimated to be upwards of 30,000 tonnes with exports lagging at 12,000 tonnes.\nQuality in 1996/97 has varied widely by region with northwestern coffee seen by buyers as best. Largely unusable black beans were proving a problem, they said.\n\"In some places we have seen 60 percent black beans,\" said one buyer. \"Black beans and debris are still slowing grading.\"\nAn exporter said: \"Ivory Coast can only condition 20,000 tonnes of coffee each month so exports of that amount would be very good.\"\nIn 1995/96, Ivorian coffee exports totalled 22,461 tonnes by the end of February with only 2,332 tonnes exported in February itself.\nExports then picked up to around 15,000 tonnes in March and 21,000 tonnes in April. Arrivals data were less clear.\nIvory Coast exported 150,000 tonnes of its total 180,000 tonnes 1995/96 crop and has forecast a total crop of 230,000 tonnes for this year. Some upcountry buyers expect 250,000 tonnes or more.\nIvorian coffee marketing usually does not get underway until peak cocoa arrivals tail off after January as stored cocoa deteriorates faster than coffee.\nOne coffee plantation manager in central Ivory Coast said later season arrivals could be lower than expected if dry conditions were not broken by rain.\n\"There is a risk of damage to coffee trees but cocoa is holding on well. We need a couple of rains,\" he added.\nA light Harmattan wind followed by hot weather settled over Ivory Coast in late January. Rains since have been scant.\n\"Rains for January are 20 percent down on normal,\" the plantation managter said by telephone on Friday. \"We make a little clearing around the trunk (of the tree) to allow watering while the threat of dessication persists,\" he added.\nWeeds had been allowed to grow up around young bushes to protect them from direct sun, he said.\nA report for Ivory Coast on sector liberalisation and quality by a private British consultant was ready at the end of January but late fee payment meant it had not been delivered.\n\"Last year exporters took anything so farmers have got out of the habit of maintaining trees,\" said one Gagnoa-based buyer.\n-- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90\n", "Ivory Coast exported 16,307 tonnes of robusta coffee beans in March, against 13,527 in February and 20,903 in March 1996, official shipping data show.\nIvorian coffee marketing started later than usual in 1996/97 after low world prices in late 1996, tighter bank lending policies to exporters and quality problems that slowed grading, exporters said.\n\"This year is slower but there is still plenty of coffee about,\" said one industry buyer, noting that the season opened in mid-November rather than October.\nThe data showed 12,904 tonnes of March exports went from Abidjan, the main port, with 3,403 shipped from Ivory Coast's second port of San Pedro.\nCumulative exports in the first six months of the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) season were 45,783 tonnes against 58,667 in the same period of 1995/96.\nCoffee product exports, from Abidjan, included 694 tonnes of soluble coffee and six tonnes of roasted coffee.\nIvory Coast forecast a 1996/97 crop of 230,000 tonnes, against 180,000 tonnes recorded last year.\nPort sources put arrivals by late March 1997 at over 175,000 tonnes but said Ivory Coast would at least meet its full year output forecast.\nSome buyers are still sorting and grading at stores and say more coffee is still held in villages.\nBut they said the quality of coffee sacks had also been poor in some areas due a shortage of supply from exporters.

He said USWeb would also expand outside the United States, particularly in Southeast Asia and Japan, by the end of October.  \nNext year, USWeb will concentrate on profitability, he said. \"In January 1998 the focus is on leveraging what we built,\" Firmage said in an interview in Palo Alto.\nHe said the company was seeking to achieve economies of scale in the market for services related to building Internet sites and intranets -- internal corporate computer networks that take advantage of inexpensive Internet technologies.\nFirmage said USWeb in its first phase succeeded in building a string of franchises in 54 locations in 26 states, including recent affiliates in Austin, Texas., Seattle, Pittsburgh, and Irving and Laguna Hills, Calif.  \nThe chief executive said USWeb had also succeeded in building a strong name and thus a currency for expansion. A recent study rated USWeb third among information technology executives for brand awareness, behind AT&amp;T Corp and MCI Communications Corp, he said.\nFirmage said the company was close to arranging a second round of financing. Last year, USWeb raised $17 million from Softbank Corp of Japan and Crosspoint Ventures, which valued USWeb at $31 million, he said.  \nFirmage declined to project the size of any new investment.\nBy next year, the company's expansion should help USWeb become \"broad and deep and profitable,\" he said, declining to elaborate on expected profit margins.\nFirmage said more than 50 percent of USWeb's business was \"the $50,000 to $1 million range of companies setting up business-critical sites for department-sized operations.  \nThat work, and even much of the business of setting up enterprise-wide sites ranging in value from $500,000 to $3.0 million, is below the horizon of some of the bigger high-technology consulting firms, he added.\nFirmage said Internet technologies accounted for an increasing share of the $20 billion information technology out-sourcing market.\nThe affiliates that USWeb is acquiring are in Washington, San Francisco, the New York City area, Orange County, Calif., Philadelphia, and Milwaukee.\nFirmage declined to discuss when or whether the company may consider an initial public stock offering. But, he said, with the current moribund IPO market and declining share prices, \"the private market is the place to be right now.\"\nMeanwhile, acquisition offers the owners of its franchises a way of creating some liquidity in their holdings, he said.\n\"There's no question that this does open the possibility of liquidity,\" he said. \"We have a liquidity path.\"\nUSWeb's operations now encompass some 400 to 500 people.

Ltd put aside their long-running dispute over the Japanese market to work jointly with several Japanese camera makers to set standards and develop the APS cameras.\nInnovation, Carp said, is increasingly combined with more flexible manufacturing processes so that launches take place with minimal inventory but with a quick follow-up to ensure that strong-selling products do not run out. \"The old way was to build inventory, then launch,\" he said.\nRestructuring in such an environment will be a continuous process, he said, with some areas, which he declined to specify, requiring imminent reappraisal on product lines, sales channels or manufacturing processes.\n\"There are areas of the company that will probably need to have some downsizing going forward,\" Carp said.\nHe said Kodak would not rule out acquisitions as one way to fill a gap in product lines, but declined to say where he saw Kodak's deficiencies. \"It would give you more strategy than I would want to,\" he said.\n", "British investment bank Close Brothers said on Monday its enlarged corporate finance business was exceeding expectations and helping strong fee earnings.\n\"The corporate finance business has gone much better than we ever dreamt,\" Rod Kent, Close Brothers' managing director, told Reuters.\nThe group earlier today announced a 30 percent increase in first half pre-tax profits to 28.2 million pounds ($45.8 million), from 21.7 million the previous year.\nClose Brothers enlarged its corporate finance division last May when it bought Hill Samuel's corporate finance department from Britain's Lloyds TSB Group Plc.\nIt said the integration had been very successful, with no material loss of clients or staff and had led to a leap in activity and profits in the corporate finance area. Kent said Close Brothers now had \"well over 80 quoted clients\", adding it was focusing on giving advice to growth companies.\n\"It is quite clear from the figures that we have got off to a good start on our corporate finance side,\" he said, adding the majority of an increase in fees and commissions from 9.0 million stg to 19 million stg had come from this quarter.\nKent was also upbeat about Close Brothers' other main business areas, including other aspects of what it calls \"City Merchant Banking\".\nHe said the asset finance division had grown to new records in advances and profits. The division accounted for 41 percent of operating profits during the period, down from 44 percent for the same period a year earlier.\nAnd WINS, the former Winterflood Securities market-making arm, had \"a very good half\" retaining its position in the market place where it benefited particularly from high levels of activity in smaller company stocks.\nKent said WINS' small retail order gilts business had moved into profitability during the period, adding that worries about an order driven system were unlikely to materialise.\nMarket-making accounted for 33 percent of operating profits during the period, down from 34 percent, while merchant banking accounted for 26 percent, up from 22 percent. Kent said he was happy with the overall mix of business.\nWithin the merchant banking arm, Kent said the insurance premium finance division PROMPT was \"going like a train\" and the group was making steady progress in its other specialist business.\nAsked about the likelihood of Close Brothers making acquisitions to grow its business, Kent said the firm would be patient when it came to buying other companies.\n\"We have clearly signalled our intentions to get something on the investment management side,\" he said, adding that on the basis of the high valuations of investment management companies at the moment, it would be difficult to buy.\nAnd Kent said he was not worried by the trend for smaller merchant banks such as Close Brothers to be gobbled up by larger expanding foreign investment banks.\n\"I have never been concerned about it. Our best asset is our performance. Ownership is in the public arena,\" he said.\nClose Brothers said it would continue to see organic growth in its activities but warned the forthcoming election in Britain could cause a temporary slow-down in some of its businesses.\nThe group announced an increased interim dividend of 3.8 pence, up from 3.2 pence, while earnings per share for the period rose 21 percent to 15.31 pence from 12.64 pence.

Traditionally, the two unions have chosen different targets and threaten each with a national strike to push negotiations along.\nPacts covering about 400,000 Big Three hourly workers in the United States and 53,000 in Canada expire on September 14.  \nMcAlinden said Ford has offered the UAW some opportunities to move some parts manufacturing now done by outside suppliers back into Ford plants. That's the opposite of the task that GM is trying accomplish -- shifting more of its parts work to outside suppliers to bring down its burdensome cost structure.\nIn addition, Ford earlier this year encouraged one of its suppliers, Johnson Controls Inc to allow some of its plants to be organized by the UAW -- a move that could help the union reverse declining membership rolls.  \nIf Ford is chosen to negotiate the pattern agreement for the Big Three automakers in the United States, it could craft an agreement that would help meet its own needs, but that would hold back GM's cost-cutting progress.\n\"Ford may try to throw them a chicken bone to choke on,\" McAlinden said.\nYokich last week opted to delay the union's choice of a target and analysts said he could let GM and Ford compete for a while longer to be named the target. In 1984, the union named the two automakers as \"dual targets\" and later negotiated the patern agreement with GM.  \n\"A dual target is certainly possible, but it's hard to focus on two places at once,\" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California-Berkeley. \"The UAW may just let it roll a bit longer and select the best offer sometime later.\"\nShaiken believes the Canadian Auto Workers' choice was probably dictated by the UAW's decision to eliminate Chrysler from consideration. CAW President Buzz Hargrove's decision to focus on Chrysler \"was a reluctant choice\" since he had spent much of the summer talking tough to GM.\nSome UAW leaders at individual Chrysler plants said they supported Yokich's apparent decision to focus on Ford or GM.\n\"I have full confidence that the UAW leadership is making the right decision,\" said Gary Kimbel, vice president of UAW Local 140 at Chrysler's Warren, Mich., truck plant.\n", "Australia's central bank is out to make a buck -- preferably a foreign one.\nThe conservative, pin-striped officials of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) are quietly but aggressively building up a business in printing foreign currency.\nDeep inside a heavily guarded concrete fortress on the outskirts of Melbourne, the RBA's printing presses are already turning out as many foreign banknotes as Australian notes.\nThai baht, Singapore dollars, Indonesian rupiah and Kuwaiti dinars have all rolled off the bank's presses under printing deals with offshore central banks.\nLike the new generation of Australian banknotes, the foreign banknotes are all made of plastic using patented technology promoted world-wide by the RBA as the scourge of counterfeiters.\n\"The RBA is very keen to see this technology adopted internationally,\" said Robert Larkin, chief executive of the RBA's printing division, Note Printing Australia.\nPlastic banknotes of the type made by the RBA, which each feature a small transparent \"window\" to foil counterfeiters, last much longer in circulation than paper banknotes. A paper note can be in tatters in months; plastic can last four years.\nPLASTIC REIGNS\nNow that all Australian notes are printed on polymer, not paper, the RBA does not need to print nearly as many banknotes. Its printing presses were becoming idle.\nAbout 600 million local banknotes rolled off the RBA's presses each year before the switch to plastic notes from 1988. Now they churn out only 150 million Australian banknotes a year.\n\"We are victims of our own success, but at the same time we have liberated capacity for export opportunities,\" the printing division's sales manager, Michael Beedle, told Reuters.\nSo the bank is globe-trotting for new business, trying to convince other central banks to go plastic.\n\"Significant numbers of countries have done or are currently undertaking trials (on the plastic notes) virtually around the world,\" the RBA's Larkin said. Printing presses do not need any modification to cope with the plastic notes, he said.\nWithin three years, the RBA hopes that 75 percent of the banknotes rattling off its Melbourne presses will be for export.\nBut competition for the export dollar -- or lira, rupee or whatever currency is up for grabs -- is cut-throat.\nCanadian commercial printers Dura Note and Domtar Inc also make plastic banknotes, while the world's few commercial paper banknote printers fiercely guard their turf, Larkin said.\n\"The industry is reluctant to move away from a 300-year-old technology and there's strong resistance from printers to put plastic through the printing press,\" the RBA's Beedle said.\nMONEY-MAKING JOINT VENTURE\nThe RBA is not only targetting central banks that do not print their own banknotes. For central banks with their own presses, it wants to sell them the blank polymer notes on which they can print their own designs.\nThe RBA and British-based UCB Films Plc, a unit of Belgian chemicals and drugs group UCB, have formed a A$1.5 million (US$1.16 million) equal joint venture, Securency, to market the blank notes. RBA and UCB will split the profits.\nSecurency is ambitious and is eyeing two of the most prized of all banknote printing jobs -- the new Euro scheduled to come into circulation from 2002, as well as the greenback.\n\"The two biggest markets to go for other than China and India would be the U.S. one-dollar bill and the Euro. That's what we have set our targets on,\" Securency general manager Myles Curtis told Reuters in Melbourne.\nBut Securency has foresaken any hope of persuading European monetary authorities to make their first Euro a plastic one.\n\"We probably missed the boat first time around because they are already starting to consider the manufacture of the note, but they will have to look at the next generation,\" Curtis said.\nThe greenback is also a tantalising prospect, after an attempt to replace the U.S. one-dollar note with a new coin met a hostile public reaction.\n\"The US$1 note represents 50 percent of their manufacturing capability,\" he said, adding that a polymer note would allow the Federal Reserve to stay with a note but slash printing costs.\nHOT MONEY\nThough polymer banknotes are considered rugged enough for the Australian public, they are feeling the heat in Europe.\nA man writing from Bratislava has told The Economist magazine how he accidentally tumbled-dried an Australian note in the pocket a pair of jeans.\n\"The banknote I left in my jeans emerged shrunken and distorted,\" he wrote.\nUndaunted, Securency believes plastic money will eventually find its way into wallets around the world.\nThere is also an environmental spin-off. In Australia, worn-out banknotes are shredded and recycled to make, among other things -- plastic garbage bins and flower pots.\n(A$1 = US$0.7765)\n", "CVS Corp., the nation's fifth-largest chain of drug stores, said Friday it will acquire rival Revco D.S. Inc. for $2.8 billion in stock and the assumption of $900 million of debt.\nThe planned union will create the nation's second largest drug store chain, dominating the eastern half of the country. It will have about 4,000 stores and annual sales of $13 billion, making it the largest in terms of outlets and second-largest behind Walgreen Co. in terms of total sales.\nWhile the announcement did not state how many jobs might be eliminated in the merger, the companies said that Revco's Twinsburg, Ohio, headquarters would be phased out. Sources familiar with the companies said that most of the 1,000 people employed at the headquarters were likely to lose their jobs.\nCVS Chief Operating Officer Thomas Ryan did not dispute those estimates, saying \"it's unfortunate,\" but he said the company will retain about 98 percent of Revco employees.\nCVS said the new company, which will keep the name CVS, will be led by its existing senior management and retain the CVS headquarters in Woonsocket, R.I.\nRevco Chief Executive Officer Dwayne Hoven will leave the company after the merger is completed.\n\"He will stay through the transition. He is intently interested in seeing to it that his people in Twinsburg are well taken care of,\" a Revco spokeswoman said.\nThe merger is the latest in the drugstore chain sector, which has seen intense consolidation in the past year.\nThe transaction will solidify CVS's position in the sector and allow it to expand significantly. Analysts said the companies have little geographic overlap and the combination is not expected to generate significant antitrust concerns.\nCVS stores are located primarily in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions while Revco stores are mostly in Midwest and Southeast.\nThe merger calls for CVS to pay the equivalent of $40.64 in its shares for each share of Revco, based on Thursday's closing stock prices.\nCVS stock closed Thursday at $44 a share and Revco at $38, both on the New York Stock Exchange, but moved higher Friday.\nRevco added $3.375 to close at $41.375 in heavy trading while CVS gained $3.125 to $47.125, both on the New York Stock Exchange.\nRyan of CVS said the transaction would add to earnings slightly this year and would add another 10 cents to 15 cents per share in 1998.\n\"What we're trying to be is more than just a growth company -- a world-class healthcare retailer. And that's what I think this combination will do,\" he said in a telephone interview.\nAnalysts agreed.\n\"It's a great deal for CVS. The structure (of the deal) is going to allow it to be additive to earnings immediately,\" Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research-Maxus Group said.\n\"(CVS and Revco) are the two most dominant market share players in the industry and market share is really the name of the game,\" he said.\nBoth companies acknowledged last month that they were discussing a combination of their businesses. Ryan said that the two companies began holding discussions in October.\nRyan said CVS also had considered an acquisition of Eckerd Corp., but decided that Revco was a better fit. J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which owns Thrift drug stores, announced a $3.3 billion acquisition of Eckerd in November.\nTwo shareholders likely to prosper from the merger are Revco CEO Hoven and Revco co-Chairman Sam Zell. Zell's Chilmark Fund LP holds a 19.2 percent stake in Revco and Hoven also has large holdings in the company.\nCVS said the new company plans to open or relocate 300 stores a year after the merger is completed.\nAnalysts said the CVS-Revco union likely marks at least a near-term end to big mergers in the industry, although dozens of small chains still exist and are expected to get scooped up or join forces with bigger operators.\nRevco had agreed in November, 1995, to merge with Rite Aid Corp. in a $1.8 billion deal, but that merger collapsed last April after federal and state regulators raised antitrust concerns.\nAnalysts said the companies have little goeographic overlap, and the union of CVS and Revco was not expected to generate significant antitrust concerns.\n\"A number of companies in the sector are coming to us and asking us what they should do strategically,\" said Marty Murrer, managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which advised CVS in the Revco deal and has been a key player in the sector's biggest transactions.\nArbor Drug Inc., Genovese Drug Stores Inc. and privately held Duane Reade Inc. have been cited as likely candidates to participate in the consolidation sweeping the sector.\n", "The Czech National Bank (CNB) on Tuesday put the largest fully-private bank, Agrobanka a.s., under forced administration due to liquidity problems arising from the failure of another bank, Kreditni Banka a.s..\nThe central bank, in its 12th intervention into a commercial bank in the post-Communist period, said it would guarantee all of Agrobanka's deposits during a \"temporary\" forced administration period of an unspecified duration.\nIn a statement issued after an overnight meeting of the Czech cabinet, the CNB said that problems of Agrobanka, the country's fifth largest overall, had arisen as a consequence of the failure of Kreditni Banka a.s..\nIt also said the move stemmed from the investigation of people in the Kreditni case -- in which five people connected to Kreditni have been indicted on fraud charges -- who are also connected to Agrobanka.\n\"The investigation of the fall of Kreditni Banka...and its politicization, and charges against people connected to Agrobanka, negatively influences the liquidity position of this bank (Agrobanka),\" the CNB said in its statement.\nWhile over 70 percent of banking activity in the country is down within the four largest banks -- each with the state as a major shareholder -- Agrobanka has grown to be the largest fully-private bank with four billion crowns ($151 million) in basic capital.\nIn order to support Agrobanka, the CNB said it would guarantee all deposits at the bank, and that it would ensure, in cooperation with other commercial banks, sufficient \"financial sources\" for Agrobanka, should it need them.\nCzech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the central bank's move was a preventative step aimed at keeping the banking sector sound. \"There isn't even the slightest reason for any sort of banking panic,\" Klaus told journalists on Tuesday.\nHe said the move by the central bank is a way to stop problems in the banking sector escalating.\nThe fall in August of Kreditni, based in the western city of Plzen, caused a political furore and led local media to question the effectiveness of bank supervision.\nKreditni and Agrobanka were linked to each other through the secretive Czech investment group Motoinvest which used both banks to finance its securities operations.\nAn official from Motoinvest was indicted last weeekend for a debt swap scheme which police said led, in-part, to the failure of Kreditni Banka.\nBut Motoinvest has denied any responsibility for the failure of Kreditni which caused losses of about 12 billion crowns.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=26.51 Czech Crown)\n", "The Association of British Insurers (ABI) on Thursday cautioned the new Labour government against reducing tax credits on dividends or lowering incentives to pension provision in its first budget.\nIt also called on Labour to use the budget, expected in June, to encourage long-term savings and warned it against changes in the tax system which would undermine consumer confidence.\nReducing the level of tax credits on dividends would hit Personal Equity Plans (PEPs) and charities as well as pension business, said the ABI.\nIt would also lead to an increased imbalance between the tax treatment of interest and dividends, it said.\nAdvance corporation tax (ACT) is payable by British tax resident companies on dividends but can be offset against their mainstream corporation tax liability.\nCurrently, institutions such as pension funds pay no tax and are able to generate extra income by claiming back the ACT paid by companies which distribute dividends net of basic tax.\nBecause the Labour party has ruled out changes to income tax, it is widely believed to be considering reducing the credit for corporation tax paid to non-taxpaying recipients of dividends, including pension funds, to help meet spending plans.\nThe Association's director general Mark Boleat said its budget representations aimed to help the government's commitment to encourage savings and develop the partnership between public and private provision.\n\"Adequate pension provision and savings are essential for everyone and it is vital that the tax system should be targeted at encouraging this and without undue complexity,\" said Boleat.\nAccording to the ABI, more people could be encouraged to start or increase levels of pension savings through simplifying the pension contribution rules and introducing greater flexibility for pension schemes to cover long-term care and other forms of provision.\nIt also advised the introduction of savings accounts with tax treatment along PEP lines and extending the qualifying status for life insurance policies.\nRestricting tax relief on pension contributions to the basic rate of income tax would make pension savings less attractive and could lead to a transfer of funds into more tax favoured arrangements such as PEPs, it said.\nSimilarly, removing tax relief on private medical insurance for the over 60s would substantially reduce take-up of insurance by older individuials and increase pressure on National Health spending.\nThe ABI also urged the government not to raise the  current rate of insurance premium tax, saying it would represent a threat to prudent protection.\nIt said if individuals bore risks themselves rather than insure they could be unable to meet the resultant financial liabilities and called for the eventual abolition of it.\nMost non-life premiums are taxed at a rate of four percent with some classes of business such as travel insurance anbd extended warranties facing rates of 17-1/2 percent\n\"It is a regressive tax in its effect and hits hardest those in tne poorer sectors of the community who can least afford an unexpected loss,\" said Boleat.\n-- Simon Cowell, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n", "China's first and only non-state bank, the China Minsheng Banking Corp, is planning major growth in 1997 but will always be a niche player beside the country's huge state banks, a senior official said on Thursday.\nMinsheng was founded in Beijing a year ago, opened Shanghai and Guangzhou branches last month, and plans to open branches in at least six other Chinese cities over the next 12 months, Shanghai branch manager Lu Jiashan said.\n\"The plan is to set up branches in Shenzhen, Dalian, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu and either Qingdao or Jinan. If it's completed, the scale of the bank by the end of 1997 will be quite significant,\" Lu said in an interview.\nBut he said the bank's ambitious growth plans posed no threat to the state banks that dominate the country's banking sector.\n\"We will grow fast, but we are in a weak position compared to the state banks, we're no threat to them at all,\" he said. \"The private banks will always be small players.\"\nThe Minsheng Bank is an anomaly in China's tightly controlled banking system.\nThe bank doesn't seem to quite rate the title \"private\", but it has 59 shareholders, mostly private Chinese firms including the Hope Group, a feed grain producer based in Sichuan province, and the Xiamen Fuxun Group based in Fujian province.\nLu said that the bank had complete freedom to make loans, in terms of both recipients and amounts, a huge difference from the state banks who have strict loan quotas they must stick to, and instructions on how much they must lend state enterprises.\n\"All our loans are based purely on commercial considerations, there are no quotas, no administrative interference in the loan process at all. There are also no policy loan responsibilities,\" he said.\nLu said the central bank viewed the Minsheng Bank as an experiment.\n\"Whether there will be more non-state banks or not is not for me to answer, but one thing we can be sure of is that there will be a lot more banks in China in the future, and many of them will be share-based companies,\" he said.\nThe bank announced a small profit of 11 million yuan for its first year of operations and already has more than seven billion yuan in assets, Lu said.\n\"We have been open in Shanghai for only 18 days, but we already have assets of one billion yuan, which is much better than my expectations. We have 150 to 160 enterprises that have opened accounts with us,\" he said.\nHe said the bank's target was to triple the assets of the Shanghai branch to three billion yuan by the end of 1997 and open several branch offices around the city.\nThe bank's main focus, he said, would eventually be loans to private companies, although at this point only 10 percent of its customers are private firms with state enterprises and listed companies making up the lion's share.\n\"In the past, it has not been so easy for private firms to get banking support,\" Lu said. \"Now there is a bank specialising in this sector, helping them with their businesses, which I am sure will give a boost to the economy as a whole.\"\nHe said the branch had so far made 12 loans of which three were to private companies.\n\"There are risks involved, and we need to make the right choice of companies that will promote the market economy as a whole, so we don't invest blindly,\" he said.\n", "The top executive of Japan's leading brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, resigned from his post on Friday to atone for a scandal over suspected illegal deals.\nNomura said president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down as of Friday and became an adviser to the company. Chairman Masashi Suzuki takes on the job of president in addition to the chairmanship.\n\"As the top official of the company, I think I should take responsibility,\" Sakamaki told a news conference.\nThe scandal broke last week when Nomura said two of its directors, who subsequently resigned, had made apparently illegal deals and funnelled funds to a corporate client linked by Japanese media to a former \"sokaiya\" racketeer.\nThe president's resignation, which was widely expected, comes amid signs that the scandal may be widening as suspicion falls on other prestigious Japanese brokerages.\nNomura's Sakamaki said the scandal was not endemic in the company itself, but added he did not know whether other Nomura executives were involved in the suspected illegal deals, which are being investigated by the nation's securities watchdog.\nThe brokerage pledged to strive to win back public trust.\n\"My first priority is to restore confidence,\" chairman Suzuki told the same news conference. \"We will take all possible measures to avoid any repetition of such scandals.\"\nSokaiya, often linked to \"yakuza\" crime syndicates, typically try to extort money from firms by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called \"sokai\" in Japanese.\nCompanies have also been known to hire sokaiya to muzzle legitimate shareholders' questions at the annual meetings.\nThe case is another blot on the reputation of corporate Japan after a spate of scandals over unauthorised trading in financial markets, shady oil deals and overly cosy ties in the \"iron triangle\" of politics, business and bureaucracy.\nSpeculation is also spreading that similar scandals may emerge at other brokerages.\nFinance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said on Friday that regulators will likely probe Japan's other \"Big Four\" brokerages after reports that the corporate client cited in the Nomura scandal as having sokaiya links also holds accounts at other leading securities houses.\n\"It's hard to believe the authorities will sit by after such reports. It's common sense for them to conduct an appropriate investigation,\" he said.\nNomura had been widely expected to make a top management sacrifice to express remorse over its second scandal in just six years. In 1991, senior Nomura executives Setsuya Tabuchi and Yoshihisa Tabuchi (no relation) resigned over revelations the brokerage had compensated favoured clients for losses and that affiliates had dealt with gangsters.\nThe fate of the two Tabuchis, who rejoined Nomura's board in 1995, was being watched by some analysts for clues to how serious the brokerage was about internal reform. Nomura said on Friday that the two will quit the board again.\nThe scandal is a potentially serious blow to Nomura's business as well as its reputation, as a number of financial firms, including one in the Nomura group, have suspended dealings with the brokerage pending the outcome of the probe by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC).\nNomura also faces a possible shareholder suit seeking compensation for any losses resulting from the scandal.\nLeading credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said on Friday that short-term financial damage may be limited but Nomura faces the challenge of strengthening management control, restoring its reputation and regaining business momentum.\n", "A tough price review of British Gas Plc by industry regulator Clare Spottiswoode has heralded a new era for Britain's utility watchdogs as they at last show their teeth, analysts said on Wednesday.\nSector watchdogs have borne the brunt of derision and mockery over several years while lucrative utility companies' shares surged, apparently unruffled by regulatory price curbs.\nLast March, electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild was even forced to reopen a price review on the 12 cash-rich electricity companies, having been embarrassed by the firms' largesse to their investors as they fended off hostile bids.\n\"It does look like regulators aren't going to have the wool pulled over their eyes any longer,\" said one analyst who declined to be named.\n\"They're quite astute these days and they are getting pretty wise to these companies.\"\nConsumers, regulators say, will now feel more of the benefits of the controversial privatisation of Britain's gas, water and electricity industries.\nSpottiswoode went some way on Wednesday towards meeting British Gas's objections to her earlier proposal of a maximum 28 percent cut in the prices charged by TransCo, the British Gas pipeline subsidiary, when she suggested a 20 percent one-off reduction in its charges.\nBut analysts said Spottiswoode had already set a new agenda with her initial proposals in May that sent gas shares plunging.\nTwo subsequent reviews by the power watchdog on Northern Ireland Electricity and National Grid, the power transmission network, have mirrored her unrelenting stance.\n\"I see May 13 as being a landmark date in terms of regulation,\" said Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Yamaichi.\n\"That day we saw the first regulator being fairly savage on a company and, above all, actually saying that if you're heavily cash-negative from year to year -- so be it.\"\nDespite British Gas's continued insistence that the planned Transco price curbs could cost the group 10,000 jobs, Spottiswoode's final proposals do show that there is scope during the consultation period to moderate positions.\nConsumers will nevertheless see gas bills fall by 30 pounds ($46.44) next year, rising to 50 pounds in 2001.\nThere has also already been a 50 pound reduction in bills this year when electricity companies passed on to consumers the money they received from the sale of their National Grid shares.\nTo the outrage of British Gas, Spottiswoode initially proposed a one-off cut of 20-28 percent followed by annual price reductions at a rate of five percent below inflation per year.\nShe now wants Transco to cut prices by only 2.5 percent annually after the first big chop. Some analysts see the group's revenues being reined in by about 400 million pounds per year.\n\"She's been more lenient than some had expected, but I still think it's a very tough review,\" noted one analyst.\nLittlechild is proposing cutting the Grid's prices by between 20 and 26 percent next year, followed by a cut in annual prices of four percentage points below inflation.\nHis final proposals will be published in September and until then, the company will be locked in last-minute battles with its regulator.\nThe Grid may see its revenues slashed by about 1.2 billion pounds over four years.

But many young men are proudly defiant.\nFor Tibetan monks, nuns and civilians, displaying pictures of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, could mean imprisonment. But almost every Tibetan family in the deeply religious Himalayan region of China has one.\nUighurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minority groups tried to resist Chinese rule for decades, but uprisings were crushed and dissent silenced under the late chairman Mao Zedong's iron-fisted rule.\nWith Beijing loosening its grip slightly in recent years, more Uighurs and Tibetans have dared to speak their minds, and many clamour for independence in defiance of Beijing's attempts to dilute their culture.\nAn anti-Chinese riot in the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang -- a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan -- this month left nine people dead and 198 wounded, officials said. Police arrested up to 300 people after the riot.\n\"Minority ethnic groups are like wild horses that are difficult to tame,\" a government official in Beijing said.\n\"They could gallop away at any time...regardless of how well fed they are,\" said the official, speaking anonymously. \"Like a centrifugal force, their tendency is to move away.\n\"Ethnic minorities are an old problem, a big problem and a difficult problem to solve,\" the official added.\nThis month's Moslem riot was one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang -- which means New Frontier in Chinese -- since the communist takeover in 1949.\nXinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by bombings and assassination attempts.\nTibet has been rocked periodically by riots led by Buddhist monks and nuns loyal to the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against the Chinese.\nChina accuses the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, of fomenting unrest in Tibet.\nExtremities committed during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang and Tibet have contributed to the resolve of ethnic minorities to try to bolt, analysts said.\nHan Chinese, who account for more than 90 percent of China's population of 1.2 billion, have been accused of trying to dilute the cultures of Uighurs and Tibetans.\nUighurs were banned from learning their written language in the Cultural Revolution. \"It's like hacking them with a knife.

Asia is a highly dynamic region, but some growing pains are inevitable, reflected in the cyclical slowdown in a number of key export industries or structural problems in Thailand and South Korea.\n\"Nevertheless, companies that are well-managed and well-positioned have an excellent environment in which to prosper,\" Guinness Flight said.\nTo gain access to that growth, investors need to have a clear idea of which markets are the strongest. Stock picking has become increasingly important, it said.\nBy focusing on companies that constitute the bulk of index capitalisation, investors may miss many of the best opportunities. This partly reflects the undeveloped nature of these markets where blue chips account for the lion's share of turnover, commission and research, the report said.\nConcentrating on small and medium-capitalisation stocks is time-consuming and difficult because the information sources are fewer, but Guinness Flight argued it was essential.\n\"Management quality is the key criterion,\" it said. \"This is very much 'growth investing' as good sustainable earnings growth and strong cashflow are indispensible if a company is to be successful and provide a good return to shareholders.

Union members remained on the job Saturday, as the company proceeded with its normal weekend operations of limited production and maintenance work.\n\"There is progress,\" said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be named. \"The attitudes are good.\"\nA strike at American Axle's five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y., would shut down light truck production at GM's 11 North American truck plants within days, and create more supplier hardships for Ford Motor Co.\nAmerican Axle, which was spun off from GM in 1994, supplies rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars, as well as various parts for other passenger car lines.\nThe company makes axle shafts that are used by Ford in its F-150 pickup trucks, Expedition and Explorer sport/utilities and some rear-drive passenger cars, although inventories of those supplies are not as critical as the GM parts. It also makes axles for a small number of Chrysler Corp. light truck products.\nTight inventories among axle suppliers means GM's light truck plants would run out of parts by early next week, analysts said. The world's largest automaker could lose after-tax profits of $20 million a day if it were forced to suspend light truck production, analysts said.\nAmerican Axle and the UAW are at odds over wages and other economic issues as the union seeks to impose on the company the same pattern contract the Big Three automakers agreed to for about 400,000 UAW members last fall.\nAutomakers guaranteed jobs for 95 percent of their current workforce in a contract that provides $2,000 lump sum payments in the first year and wage hikes of three percent in the second and third years. The pact allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $19.\nAmerican Axle, however, wants to start new hires at a lower rate and extend the time it takes to reach the full rate to six years, union officials said. The Big Three pact has a \"grow- in\" rate of three years.\nBut if the company were forced to match the Big Three pattern it would be at a severe cost disadvantage against its competitors, a company spokesman has said.\nThe American Axle talks have drawn attention because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract.\nMeantime, a UAW strike against Johnson Controls Inc, a key seat supplier for Ford, entered its 19th day Saturday with no settlement.\n", "Australia's biggest retailer Coles Myer Ltd on Thursday reported a 41 percent surge in half-year earnings, its first profit rise in almost two years.\nThe result buoyed Coles' once-sinking share price, which firmed despite a weaker market, and follows a two-year nightmare of sliding profits, controversy and tight-fisted consumers.\nColes, which pockets nearly 18 cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, reported a net profit of A$273.6 million for half-year ended January 26, against A$194.5 million a year ago.  \nBefore abnormals, net earnings leapt 23 percent to a better-than-expected A$229 million, boosting the shares 10 cents above Wednesday's close to A$6.01 (US$4.74) in morning trade.\n\"What is important are people's expectations of the turnaround now. I think that's why the stock is where it is, on anticipation of much better margins and profit,\" a broker said.\nColes also on Thursday gave a bullish forecast for the full year ending July 27, suggesting it expected more double-digit profit growth in the second half of 1996/97.\n", "Liggett Group's pact breaking away from other cigarette makers will spur few defections in the stretches of the southern United States where tobacco has been king for centuries.\n\"Tobacco farmers will continue to have a market, regardless of the success or failure of the suits,\" North Carolina State Attorney General Mike Easley said.\nTobacco is North Carolina's single biggest crop and the plant's broad, brown leaves sustain thousands of manufacturing, financial and other jobs.\n\"Tobacco supports 200,000 families in North Carolina,\" said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for state Gov. Jim Hunt.\nTennessee, Virgina, South Carolina, Kentucky and Georgia are also major tobacco-growing states.\nThe maker of Chesterfields and L&amp;M branded cigarettes, Liggett last week rocked the tobacco business and Wall Street by agreeing to settle lawsuits with 22 state attorneys general\nLiggett promised to pay 25 percent of its pre-tax profits for the next quarter century and label its cigarettes as addictive substances. It also agreed to hand over to the attorneys general internal documents which might bolster multi-billion dollar claims against other cigarette makers.\nNo cigarette company but Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group, has made such a deal. Other cigarette makers, such as Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, fiercely condemned the pact.\n\"It'll give everybody something to talk about, but I don't think it will cause any adverse effects in the short term,\" said William Graham, a retired Farm Credit Services loan officer in Proctorville, in southeastern North Carolina.\n\"I just don't think people are aware of just how much tax money tobacco generates in this country,\" he said.\n\"What I want to say is not fit to print,\" said tobacco grower Grady Britt of Broad Ridge, also in southeastern North Carolina, where tobacco has been a mainstay for more than 200 years.\nOther growers worried that the Liggett pact was another sign that tobacco, also a major export accounting last year for about 20 percent of the U.S. net agricultural trade surplus, was headed for hard times.\n\"The government's going to take tobacco away from us, but they aren't going to give anything back,\" said Newberry Mitchell, a grower since the early 1960s.\n\"All this decision is going to do is give the government more ammunition to classify tobacco as a drug and regulate it,\" said Erskine Floyd, another grower who lives in Barnesville, North Carolina.\nEasley, the North Carolina attorney general, has not filed a lawsuit against cigarette makers and said the settlement on Thursday was less important than it appeared.\nHe described Liggett, the fifth-ranked cigarette maker with only a sliver of the market, as a minor industry player and said the legal grounding for the lawsuits by the attorneys general was shaky.\n", "Fearsome of injuries caused by deploying airbags, consumers polled by a market research firm gave safety a lower ranking when choosing a new vehicle for the first time in four years, according to a study released on Sunday.\nThe biggest drop came with regard to airbags, which have been linked to the deaths of dozens of children and small adults by federal safety regulators.\nThe number of people who gave driver and passenger side air bags a very important or important rating fell to 57 percent from 82 percent the previous year, according to the report conducted by the Dohring Co. Inc., a Glendale, Calif.-based market research firm.\nRespondents who said those air bags are \"not at all important\" in their purchase decision jumped to 24 percent from 6 percent.\n\"No doubt the safety reports of physical injury have contributed to this,\" Rik Kinney, senior vice president of Dohring Co. \"This is the first time since we started doing this study in 1993 that the importance of all safety-related equipment declined.\"\nKinney said 96 percent of those surveyed had seen or heard media reports of potential injuries from airbags. Harm to children ranked as the single biggest fear, with 45 percent of those listing that as a concern.\nThe study was conducted in January 1997 from a random sample of 1,253 consumers in all 50 states. The poll's margin of error is 2.8 percent.\nIn other findings, the Dohring study found the number of people who have purchased or will shop at a new car dealership have access to on-line information serivces was up 10 percent to 38 percent.\nBut the study found that 81 percent of those talked to would still want to test drive a vehicle, even if they researched it over a computer on-line service. Only 4 percent plan to use an on-line service to buy their vehicle.\nThe study also found that 28 percent of the respondents would rather buy their next used car from a new car dealership that has a manufacturer's certified program, vs. 15 percent who said they would go to a used car superstore.\nKinney said the study was paid for by Dohring. But he acknowledged the company receives 99 percent of its revenues from by selling research to automakers, dealer advertising associations and individual auto dealerships.\n", "A top federal regulator Thursday urged banks to be more careful in issuing credit cards as an industry group reported that late payments by consumers jumped to a record level at the end of last year.\nThe latest sign that consumers are overburdened with credit card debt came in survey by the American Bankers Association.\nThe group said that in the fourth quarter of 1996 late payments jumped to 3.72 percent of credit card accounts, the highest rate since it began tracking delinquencies in 1980 and up from 3.34 percent a year earlier.\nThe survey, in conjunction with earlier reports that personal bankruptices are at record levels and bank losses from credit card loans are growing, has bank regulators on edge.\nComptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, whose office oversees almost 3,000 nationally chartered banks, said the problems, while still under control, raise concerns about the safety and soundess of banks.\n\"We are continuing to see signs of slippage in some areas that you and we must address now,\" he told a New York State Bankers Association meeting in Washington on Thursday.\n\"It is worrisome to consider that there was a 44 percent growth in credit card losses and a 50 percent increase in credit card delinquencies during the past year,\" Ludwig said.\nLudwig also noted that bank chargeoffs on credit cards \"increased significantly\" in January to 6.5 percent of the $220 billion of loans outstanding from 4.7 percent a year earlier.\n\"These statistics are particularly troubling given the current health of the economy,\" he said.\nAs a result, the Comptroller's office issued an advisory to banks on credit underwriting standards and portfolio credit risk management, Ludwig said.\n\"The role of the regulator is to take action before potential problems become real problems,\" Ludwig said. \"Our goal is to remind national banks how changes in underwriting standards affect overall portfolio credit risk and to highlight the key component of an effective portfolio credit risk management process.\"\nTighter loan standards should prevent the problem from getting out of hand, but losses may grow further before the new standards have an impact, Ludwig said.\n\"Current losses likely represent weaker credits making their way through the pipeline,\" he said. \"We can expect some continued losses, but hopefully we'll begin to see positive effects of those cautious underwriting decisions.\"\nBankers had expected that tighter credit standards put into place in recent years would already have started reducing losses.\n\"We are disappointed that the numbers didn't improve,\" American Bankers Association chief economist James Chessen said. \"We had hoped that banks' tightening of credit standards over the last several years would have reversed the trend of delinquencies by now.\"\nIn the fourth quarter of 1996, 37 percent of banks reported tightening standards, a drop from 49 percent in both the second and third quarters of 1996, the association said.\nDelinquency rates also ticked up on home equity loans, the group reported. The delinquency rate was 1.42 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.29 percent in the previous quarter and 1.41 percent in the same period the previous year.\nOn auto loans, the delinquency rate was 2.03 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.95 percent the previous quarter and 1.87 percent a year earlier.\nDelinquent payments are defined as 30 days or more overdue.\n", "Britain's United Assurance Group, created by the merger of Refuge and United Friendly last October, said on Thursday 2,200 jobs would be lost as a result of integration, some 400 more than had been originally expected.\nThe company, Britain's fourth largest home services insurer -- selling through agents who visit customers homes, said last August that it expected around a quarter of the group's 7,100 employees would lose their jobs.\nUnited is planning to close over half its offices in an effort to cut costs by around 37 million pounds ($60 million) a year.\nGroup chief executive George Mack said that the opportunities to make cost savings and achieve economies of scale were essential in enabling it to compete in its chosen businesses.\nThe rationalisation and integration will involve an eventual reduction in the group's regional and branch offices to 116 from 279.\nUnited has set aside 76.3 million pounds for the expected integration costs.\nThe new structure would enable greater emphasis to be placed on clients' needs, the company said.\nMack declined to rule out further job losses but told Reuters that any reductions were unlikely to be material in the near term.\n\"We are looking to make sure we're lean and efficient in our back offices and strong and expanding on our sales force front... if anything we're looking to expand our sales force,\" he said.\nThe group has yet to get a response from the Department of Trade and Industry to its proposals that the costs for the restructuring be borne by shareholders. Under its plans shareholders would receive a greater return for taking on the additional risk.\nThe news of the lay-offs cames as the merged group announced pre-tax profits of 549.3 million pounds for 1996, which included 430 million pounds from the transfer of 'orphan assets' -- surplus insurance funds -- to shareholders.\nUnited shares rose on the figures, adding 11-1/2 pence to 485-1/2.\nExcluding net exceptional items of 371.3 million pounds, profits from continuing operations were up 18 percent at 193.5 million pounds.\nThe dividend for the year was raised 35 percent to 18 pence per share.\nRun-off costs from the closure of the group's motor business to new business in 1996 had been higher than expected with the pre-tax loss of 15.5 million pounds reflecting the effect of an adverse increase in the number of claims and value of settlements.\nEfforts would now be concentrated on the household busines which United said offered \"great potential\" to the enlarged group.\n\"We've had a less good year this year than last. Market conditions have been less favourable but we believe we have a strong product range and sound account and with the client base of the combined group we expect to be vigorous in expanding our portfolio,\" said Mack.\nProvisions chargeable for the 11,000 cases of possible mis-selling of pensions by the group, remained broadly unchanged at 71 million pounds.\n\"We will have a clear idea of the level at which we're settling at the end of 1997 but we believe we're appropriately provided for at the moment. Until we have specific settlememnt experience there is some uncertainty in the size of that provision,\" Mack said.\n", "In a last-ditch attempt to avoid threatened U.S. economic sanctions, the Colombian government railroaded legislation through Congress on Wednesday that will mete out dramatically stiffer jail terms for drug traffickers.\nThe law, which had been bogged down in Congress for six months, was pushed through both houses in back-to-back sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday. It increases the maximum penalty for drug-related offences to 60 years from the current maximum of 24.\nPresident Ernesto Samper hailed the passage of the bill, which he will sign into law before the end of the week, as proof of Colombia's \"resolute commitment to fight all aspects of the drug trade\".\nThe vote came a week before the United States is due to announce whether to \"certify\" Colombia as a trustworthy ally in the global fight against drugs. So-called decertification for a second consecutive year could trigger economic sanctions for the country's perceived failure to crack down hard enough on the booming trade in cocaine and heroin.\n\"This is a historic step. Colombia may produce drugs, but we also produce strong laws to combat drug trafficking and crime,\" said Justice Minister Carlos Medellin.\nU.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette -- a vocal critic of Colombian anti-drug policy and of Samper's alleged ties to drug kingpins -- said the new sentencing guidelines failed to meet U.S. standards, under which major traffickers such as Mexico's Juan Garcia Abrego have been convicted to up to 11 life terms.\nBut Frechette said the new penalities constituted a marked improvement over Colombia's lenient jail sentences in the past and raised the country's penal code to \"an international level\"\nIn another last-minute bid to escape possible sanctions, which some Colombian officials already believe are in the pipeline, Colombia is due to sign a maritime accord with the United States on Thursday that will facilitate the interdiction of drug shipments at sea.\nThe United States, which already has such an agreement with Venezuela and handful of Caribbean nations, has been pursuing a similar deal with Colombia for the last six years.\n\"This is a great agreement ... we're very pleased with it,\" Frechette said. When asked whether the accord would help avert the threat of U.S. sanctions against Colombia, he added: \"We cannot ignore something as important as this.\"\nTough new jail sentences come too late, however, for Colombia's most notorious drug kingpins -- Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, the billionaire chieftains of the Cali cartel. Both were sentenced to very light sentences in January that will see them walk free in as little as five years.\n", "MGI Pharma Inc is reorienting its marketing efforts for Salagen, a drug for dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients, but it's still unable to predict when the company will turn a profit.\nIn an interview with Reuters, chief executive Charles Blitzer said Salagen is growing slowly. \"There's a lot we're learning about Salagen that we didn't understand back when it was being touted as a $100-million product,\" he said.\nOn the job since April, Blitzer said he is revamping the sales effort for the drug, which stimulates salivation.  \nThe Minnetonka, Minn.-based company has yet to post a sustainable profit. It lost $0.18 per share in 1995 and $0.82 per share in 1994. Dain Bosworth projects a loss of $0.34 per share this year and $0.15 per share in 1997.\n\"There's a question about whether we can be profitable in a sustained way in 1997,\" said chief financial officer James Adam.\nThe new strategy, bolstered by research data, encourages use of the drug during radiation treatments for head and neck cancer, rather than after treatment to relieve dry mouth, or xerostomia. A new sales force has been trained and fielded.  \n\"We're going to continue to make a steady and slow, but sure, impact in the head and neck cancer arena,\" Blitzer said.\nDain Bosworth last week lowered its estimate of the annual market for Salagen to $10-$12 million from $75 million. The firm cut its consolidated revenue estimate for MGI to $9.1 million for 1996 from $10.5 million, and to $12.4 million for 1997 from $22.4 million. Revenues were $13.3 million in 1995.\nThe company still expects to file a supplemental new drug application in the fourth quarter with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking clearance to sell Salagen as a treatment for Sjogren's Syndrome, Blitzer said.  \nSjogren's is an autoimmune disease that damages the salivary glands and most commonly affects post-menopausal women. The target population for the disorder numbers about 400,000 patients, compared to about 25,000 for xerostomia.\nData from completed clinical trials for Sjogren's may also indicate Salagen can relieve dry eye, or kerato conjunctivitis seca, with a target population of 10 million, Blitzer said. Salagen sales in the second quarter were $1.46 million, up 75 percent over the year-ago level.\nAside from Salagen, MGI continues to develop some anti-cancer compounds. Renewed attention was drawn to one, MGI 114, in July when the National Cancer Institute voted to fund a series of trials with it, he said.\nMGI on Monday completed a secondary, 1.2 million-share stock offering that yielded proceeds of $5.6 million to be devoted to \"late-stage in-licensing opportunities\" of promising anti-cancer compounds, Blitzer said.\nMGI shares were up 1/8 at 5-1/4 Tuesday.

He noted that stock options were now distributed to some 22,000 GE employees, as opposed to only 200 as recently as 1988.\nBig pay packages, including deferred compensation plans, were needed to retain top performers, Welch said.

Officials said they were closely monitoring his health.\nDiplomats have said one barometer of Deng's health in China's highly-secretive political system is the travel of top leaders and close family members, with few considered willing to be caught out of town or abroad if Deng were close to death.\nChinese officials in the Philippines said visiting Defence Minister Chi Haotian would not change his travel plans there and Beijing's mission in Israel said Vice-Premier Li Lanqing would not interrupt his current trip to Israel and Iran.\nDeng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded central Beijing compound close to the Forbidden City, home for centuries to China's emperors.\nA Hong Kong newspaper reported at the weekend that the architect of China's sweeping economic reforms was rushed to hospital last Thursday after a massive stroke that followed an earlier, mild stroke.\nDoctors said that if Deng's stroke had been a haemorrhage he could have died within hours. If it was the formation of a blood clot, he could last days or weeks, they said.\nRumours about Deng's health surface periodically and often have a direct impact on China-related bourses, where Deng's demise is seen by some as a potentially destabilising factor.\nWorries over Deng's health helped to push shares on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges sharply lower by their close on Tuesday and also rocked share prices in Taiwan and Hong Kong.\nDeng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival when he appeared frail and faltering.

It said it had suspended four more members of staff, appointed an acting head of global debt derivatives and would not pay bonuses totalling 8.0 million pounds to certain members of staff.\nThe bank said the initial findings of an inquiry into the losses, which were first revealed nearly two weeks ago, had found no flaws in the models used to calculate valuations of the derivatives in question.\nNeil Dodgson, global head of options, has already been suspended and options trader Kyriacos Papouis left the firm in December.\nIt said the further suspensions were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets.\nPeter Hall, President and Chief Operating Officer of NatWest Markets, will temporarily take on the additional responsibilities of Chief Administrative Officer.\nVincent Tomasi currently Senior Vice President and Head of US Debt Capital Markets at NatWest Markets in New York will take over as acting Head of Global Debt Derivatives.\nOwen said he was disappointed by the \"serious deficiency revealed in the interest rate options area.\"\nNatWest said the second stage of the review being undertaken by lawyers Linklaters &amp; Paines and accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand will involve the further investigation of the areas where the losses happened.\nIt said it would also mount an investigation of the management issues associated with the deficiencies in these areas.\nThe bank said that a new management structure it had intended to put into place following its 1996 acquisition of U.S. bond trading house Greenwich Capital and the creation of a Global Debt Markets division would now be accelerated.\nBritain's markets watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority will investigate the actions of individuals in the affair while bank regulator the Bank of England is likely to have something to say on the wider implications of the losses.\n($1= 0.626 British Pounds)\n", "Apple Computer Chairman Gilbert Amelio told the annual shareholders' meeting Wednesday that he was suspending Apple's executive cash bonus plan until the struggling computer maker returned to profitability.\n\"Let me assure you that my highest priority is to get this company in the black as early as possible,\" Amelio told Apple shareholders.\nAmelio said that when he took the helm of Apple Computer Inc. one year ago, it faced five crises, which he has sought to address.\n\"We were broke,\" he said, adding that financial liquidity was so tight the company barely had enough reserves to manage its daily business.\nAmelio's comments came a day after the company announced another restructuring and less than a month after Apple stunned Wall Street with a $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997.\nAmelio did not provide specifics about the restructuring or how many jobs might be cut as Apple seeks to cut costs.\nBut he said the company planned to suspend the executive bonus plan until Apple returned to profitability. Recently, Apple officials said they expect to begin making profits again by the end of the 1997 fiscal year in September.\nThe decision to suspend the cash payouts came after Apple revealed some executives received substantial bonuses last year when Apple reported an unexpected fourth-quarter profit.\nThe payout was the result of a change in the compensation plan which allowed the executives to receive bonuses based on the company's fourth-quarter rather than full-year results.\nFor the fourth quarter, which ended in September, Apple reported a profit of $25 million, surprising Wall Street, which had been expecting the company to report a modest loss.\nMuch of that profit, however, came from a one-time gain Apple recognised for an inventory adjustment. Without that, Apple would have reported a modest loss or broken even, one analyst estimated.\nBased on that one profitable quarter, Apple's senior executives received \"175 percent of their special bonus target,\" according to Apple's proxy statement. Amelio, who had a separate compensation agreement with the company, received a $648,000 bonus on top of his $990,000 base salary. Apple did not disclose the bonuses of the other executives.\nApple officials said the special bonus plan was meant to encourage executives to meet their turnaround goals.\n\"It was basically to motivate them to achieve profitability,\" Apple spokeswoman Nancy Paxton said on Tuesday. She said the executives had expected financial performance to improve after the fourth quarter.\nApple stock fell 12.5 cents to $15.25 on Nasdaq.\n", "Software giant Microsoft Corp. Thursday unveiled the highly anticipated version of its next-generation software for office computers, called Office 97.\nOffice 97 -- a package of software that includes popular programmes such as Microsoft Word for word processing, the Excel spreadsheet programme, Access database software and the PowerPoint presentation programme -- has many new features, including document collaboration and the ability to jump seamlessly from a document or spreadsheet to the Internet.\n\"Office is a centrepiece of Microsoft's Internet strategy,\" Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said at a New York news conference.\nThe software giant, which has 55 million users of Microsoft Office applications, said it had already received advance orders from nearly 10,000 retail outlets for Office 97. The software became available in stores Thursday.\nThe company said 3 million copies had been sold through corporate licensing agreements.\nIndustry analysts noted, however, that many large business users of Microsoft's Office software have not upgraded to the Windows 95 or Windows NT operating systems required by Office 97.\nMicrosoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said more than 80 percent of the improvements in Office were a result of customer feedback.\n\"Our investments in understanding the needs of customers and our continued ability to deliver exciting enhancements are the cornerstone of Office's ongoing success,\" Gates said.\nGates launched the software at a media event at New York's Lincoln Centre.\nMicrosoft dominates the office suite category of software, with a 90 percent market share, according to International Data Corp., a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass.\nBut it faces increasingly aggressive competition from Canada's Corel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus unit and its SmartSuite software.\nCorel, which uses WordPerfect word-processing software as the core of its office software, made a significant dent in Microsoft's retail market share in the second half of last year, according to industry analysts.\n\"While SmartSuite and Corel are eating away at things like price and Internet features, Microsoft's message to corporations is, 'Guys, it's the ease of use and the cost of ownership,'\" said Eric Brown, a Forrester Research analyst.\nMicrosoft said with some of its new features in Office 97, such as the Office Assistant, users can easily get answers from a built-in software \"guru\" without burdening their information systems managers. Tools such as Network Installation Wizard, Office Resource Kit and others make it easier for information system managers to install and manage the software.\n\"I'd not be surprised if we reduced the cost of ownership by one-third to one-half,\" said Dennis Tevlin, Microsoft's director of product marketing, desktop applications.\nSince Sun Microsystems Inc., International Business Machines Corp., and others have introduced lower-cost network computers, one feature they have touted is the low cost of ownership of these new devices vs. the higher cost of maintaining PCs and their hefty software.\nOffice is a huge cash generator for Microsoft. Its desktop applications group, which is dominated by Office, is expected to bring in about $5 billion of the company's fiscal 1997 revenues, which are estimated at slightly over $10 billion, according to Wall Street analysts.\nThe standard edition of Office 97 for upgrades from earlier versions of the software has an estimated retail price of $209. It will sell for $249 for upgrading from non-Microsoft suites and $499 for new users.\nOne new component in Office 97 is called Microsoft Outlook, a desktop information manager. Outlook helps users manage information, track documents and communicate.\nBy integrating e-mail, scheduling, contact management, task management and a module for tracking documents and events, Outlook acts as a central \"hub\" for Office 97.\nGates said one of his favourite features of Outlook is its e-mail filtering capability, which enables him to immediately read and answer important e-mail amid the flood of e-mail messages he receives daily from around the world.\nOther features include Internet technologies that make it easy for users to create \"hyperlinks\" linking their documents to a World Wide Web site, for example. Users can also search Office and Web-style documents on a corporate network and they can navigate documents using the familiar tools of a Web browser.\n\"We like to call this activating the Web,\" Tevlin said. \"1996 was the year of the lots of Internet infrastructure products. Office 97 is the first in this new wave of Web applications.\"\nMicrosoft's stock gained $1.50 to $86.125 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.\n", "France Telecom on Thursday announced it was cutting its call tariffs to boost telephone use ahead of its flotation in 1997 and full liberalisation of the market in 1998.\n\"Now that we are a few months away from our flotation, I would like to unveil our plans,\" chairman Michel Bon told a news conference, reiterating that the first sale of shares in the state operator could be from the second half of April.\nHe said the exact timing of the sale and details of the capital to be sold depended on market conditions and Finance Minister Jean Arthuis' decisions.\n\"What is clear is that the government will not sell more than 49.9 percent,\" Bon said. The government has said it will sell about 20 percent in the spring. \"We want to make our market introduction as much a popular success as the Deutsche Telekom sale,\" he said.\nFrom March 4, France Telecom will slash a number of call rates and in October and in 1998 there will be further cuts. The monthly standing charges, however, will increase.\nBon said the reductions were aimed at boosting telecommunications use. \"If the traffic rises by six percent in 1997 the cuts will be good for France Telecom's business model,\" he said, declining to be more specific ahead of the flotation prospectus.\nHe added that he aimed to increase foreign sales, such as the company's mobile telecommunications subsidiary in Belgium started this year, by 50 percent.\n\"Our aim is to grow the market. If we grow the market everybody will benefit, we and our competitors,\" he said.\nBon said that recent price cuts had already boosted telephone use and he added that the Itineris mobile telecommunications unit would have 1.3 million subscribers at the end of 1996, against 700,000 in 1995.\nBon said France Telecom's 1996 accounts would not be comparable to previous accounts because they would use U.S. standards. But this would not diminish the value of the company.\nFrance Telecom said it would cut national call rates by 17.5 percent on March 4 and a further 21 percent in October 1997.\nThis will bring standard call rates to 1.20 francs (22 cents) per minute by end-1997 from 2.30 francs in 1994.\nInternational rates will be slashed by 20 percent in March, putting all European countries at less than 2.50 francs per minute and North America at less than three francs.\nFrance Telecom said it would raise its monthly standing charge by 15.20 francs to 68 francs, but added this was still one of the lowest rates in Europe.\n", "China plans to abolish a raft of Hong Kong laws that allowed for democratic elections and shielded human rights in the British colony, which is set to revert to communist-ruled Beijing's control on July 1.\nA legal panel of the China-controlled Preparatory Committee, meeting in Beijing, on Sunday decided to repeal or amend 25 laws and articles, some the product of recent reforms and others the outdated trappings of the colonial era.\nListing the planned changes, China's official Xinhua news agency said recent reforms in Hong Kong had been an attempt to apply British constitutional principles in violation of the 1984 Sino-British treaty and the 1990 Basic Law governing the territory's handover.\nPro-democracy groups and the colonial government described the Preparatory Committee's move as a blow to democracy and human rights that would dent international confidence in post-1997 Hong Kong.\n\"These recommendations are sadly predictable and a retrograde step which will deal a body blow to human rights protection in Hong Kong,\" a government spokesman said.\nThe territory, under the British flag for more than 150 years, is being handed back to China at midnight on June 30.\nThe handover treaty promises the territory of 6.3 million people a high degree of autonomy and allows it to retain its freewheeling capitalist system.\nBut China has long indicated it will dismantle the reforms of British Governor Chris Patten, who expanded democracy in Hong Kong against China's wishes after he took office in 1992.\nBeijing has already appointed a provisional legislature to supplant the elected Legislative Council on July 1.\nIt is that new lawmaking body, which holds its first formal session this Saturday in the Chinese city of Shenzhen just over the border from Hong Kong, that will repeal the laws and introduce new ones.\nMany in Hong Kong fear the new laws will be draconian and repressive. China says the changes are necessary because Britain has introduced laws in Hong Kong that clash with the territory's post-1997 mini-constitution, the Basic Law.\nAmong the laws to be scrapped or amended are Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, the 1992 election law and the Societies Ordinance under which political parties are allowed and the 1995 Public Order Ordinance which allows peaceful demonstrations.\nAlso to be rolled back are some colonial-era laws such as those regulating the British military, immigration, nationality status, extradition and colonial armorial bearings.\nThe changes largely echo proposals made two years ago by one of the early China-controlled panels that deliberated on the future political set-up, the Preparatory Working Committee.\nThe 150-member Preparatory Committee assembles mainland officials and pro-Beijing politicians from Hong Kong and reports to the Chinese central government.\nThe body, chaired by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, has mapped out the contours of the post-1997 Hong Kong regime.\nIt elected a Selection Commitee that last month appointed shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as the territory's post-colonial leader and the 60 members of the new legislature.\n", "Boeing Co. said Tuesday it formed an entrepreneurial organisation that will seek out joint ventures and possibly acquisitions related to its core business of commercial airplanes.\nBoeing senior vice president of planning and international development Lawrence Clarkson will serve as president of the new organisation, Boeing Enterprises, which will be part of Boeing's commercial airplane group.\nIn an interview, Clarkson said the unit was aggressively seeking out \"very significant\" projects and could grow rapidly in the next year.\nClarkson declined to be specific about ongoing negotiations but indicated they probably would not involve new airplane models.\nInstead, he said Boeing would seek out opportunities in \"businesses that are very related to what Boeing does, but which up to now we've let other people do.\"\nFor example, Boeing executives in the past have discussed taking advantage of the company's massive database of world airline inventories to help carriers maintain service records, a business Clarkson said would fall within the new unit.\nBoeing Enterprises also will be responsible for the company's joint venture with General Electric Co. to market the 737 as a business jet.\nClarkson said formation of the unit had been discussed for some time and was unrelated to Boeing's planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n\"The idea is to have a basically independent operation so we don't get tied down with the existing bureaucracy,\" he said.\nHe said some of the prospective joint ventures could have \"significant\" international components, particularly focusing on the Asia-Pacific region.\nBoeing is continuing to study the possibility of working with Asian manufacturers to build a new small jet that would seat about 100 passengers, but Clarkson said he did not expect any decisions in the near future.\nClarkson said he expected any acquisitions would be profitable immediately.\n\"The basic objective here is to increase shareholder value and grow the company, so obviously we want it to be as profitable as possible,\" he said.\nA decision on Clarkson's replacement in planning and international development will be made in the near future, the company spokeswoman said.\nClarkson, 58, came to Boeing in 1987 from engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.\nAfter serving as a senior vice president in the commercial airplane group, Clarkson was promoted to his position in Boeing headquarters, which The New York Times descibed as \"the closest thing it has to a corporate secretary of state.\"\n\"I think I'll still have to use some of those skills, but it's kind of nice to get into more of a line operation and something new,\" Clarkson said.\nClarkson will retain his title as one of only six Boeing senior vice presidents.\n", "A Hong Kong legislator will present the government on Wednesday with a demand to press China to clarify the role of the Communist Party in Hong Kong after this year's handover.\nThe question of Communist Party activity, a taboo subject for decades, would be raised at a session on Wednesday of the Legislative Council by independent democrat Christine Loh.\nLoh's question, published in advance by the council, will ask the government to press Beijing and Hong Kong's leader-to-be Tung Chee-hwa on how the party will be represented, what its role will be, what channels of communication it will have with the Tung government, and the limits on this liaison.\nLoh wrote in an article supporting her latest move that she hoped to break down the \"wall of silence\" about the party.\n\"Past efforts to broach the subject publicly have been greeted not only with stony official silence from the Hong Kong government, but with dismay and anger in other quarters that sometimes verged on the hysterical,\" she said.\n\"How can we possibly still pretend that the Chinese Communist Party doesn't matter in Hong Kong? The most dire speculation is that it will operate in Hong Kong after 1997 much as it does in China,\" she said. \"Such political arrangements would be disastrous.\"\nThe territory is set to revert to China on July 1 after a century and a half as a British colony. When the flag changes, it is to become a highly autonomous Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, with its own distinct capitalist system.\nBut Beijing's plans to slash civil liberties and democracy, and the constant involvement of Chinese government officials in crafting the incoming government, have cast doubts on this autonomy and left many in Hong Kong fearing communist-style controls.\nThe British, Chinese and Hong Kong governments have largely avoided discussing the presence in Hong Kong of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which took power in China in 1949.\nIt is an open secret that party authority is represented by the de facto Chinese embassy, the Xinhua News Agency branch, headed by senior Communist official, Zhou Nan, effectively the party's \"First Secretary\" in the territory.\nThe party's operation working out of the Xinhua office is known as the Hong Kong and Macau Work Committee.\nBut the party has operated in an underground way for decades. Its cells have been linked to anti-British riots in the 1960s during China's radical Cultural Revolution.\nTung said last year he would legalise the Communist Party after he becomes the territory's chief executive on July 1, if asked to do so, equating it with any other political party.\nThe remark raised eyebrows among Hong Kong's 6.4 million people because the party in China wields absolute power and permeates every layer of civil and military organisation.\nSo far, China has indicated Beijing's most senior officials in Hong Kong will be a top diplomat, expected to be China's current ambassador in London, Jiang Enzhu, and the garrison commander, General Liu Zhenwu.\n", "Czech railway workers on Wednesday voted to extend a national railway strike, scheduled to end at midnight, for another 24 hours after the government supported a tough approach against the strikers.\nJaromir Dusek, chairman of the Association of Unions of Czech Railway Workers (OSZ), was quoted by the CTK news agency as saying that OSZ's strike committee had agreed to continue the action for at least another day.\nDusek was quoted by the private television channel Prima after the decision to extend the strike that the OSZ would keep extending the strike until it gets an acceptable compromise.\nThe OSZ had originally scheduled the action as a 48-hour strike, but said it would consider extending it for 24 hours at a time if its demands were not met.\nThe government on Wednesday backed Transport Minister Martin Riman's hard line against the OSZ, which has shut the country's entire rail network over potential job cuts.\nGovernment spokesman Ivo Strejcek told reporters after a cabinet meeting that \"the government expressed its support\" for Riman, who has refused union demands for a long-term railway plan that guarantees jobs while sacking the current management.\nThe spokesman declined any further comment.\nCTK quoted Riman later on Wednesday as saying a Prague court had ruled that the strike was illegal, but the OSZ then said that a different court had ruled that the strike was lawful.\nThe strike, the first major nationwide post-Communist industrial action, has had little major impact on daily life, but businesses fear the shutdown in freight service will start to bite into earnings if the strike lasts longer.\nCities have added buses to relieve commmuter pressure, but international trains have been stranded at borders with Germany, Poland, Austria, and Slovakia.\nTwo rounds of talks between Riman and union officials on Tuesday failed to break the impasse, and the minister acknowledged the strike may go on longer. Fresh talks on Wednesday have apparently not yet led to a solution.\nThe OSZ wants the government to implement a long-term plan to revive the decrepit railway system, saying that waste and inefficiency should be cleaned up before jobs are threatened.\nThe state railway company, Ceske Drahy, lost six billion crowns ($216.4 million) in 1996, and expects to lose seven billion crowns this year, but the government has been unable to put together a viable plan for reversing the losses.\nLeaders of the OSZ reported that 75 to 80 percent of the more than 100,000 railway workers had joined the strike, but management of the railway company said over 60 percent showed up for work and signed a petition against the strike.\nAn attempt to use workers who ignored the strike resulted in the operation of a just five trains on Wednesday, but the system was mostly idle.\nAn effort to reconstruct Ceske Drahy ended in 1994 when the conservative government backed off privatisation plans to halt a threatened strike just hours before it was to begin.\nThis time, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has given ominous warnings that the unions \"may go too far\" with the strike.\nMost major Czech firms have said a short-term strike will have little effect on their operations, though the coal mining company Mostecka Uhelna Spolecnost a.s. said it was losing between 15-20 million crowns a day due to the action.\n($ = 27.73 Czech Crowns)\n", "Key companies on China's foreign currency B share markets were expected to report slightly better results for 1996 after a dismal 1995, with more progress seen for 1997, analysts said on Monday.\nThe B share companies were generally lagging far behind the booming growth of China's economy, and gains in 1996 would be followed by a stronger performance in 1997 based on two interest rate cuts last year and sharply lower inflation, they said.\n\"We do expect things to get better, but it's not here yet,\" said Bruce Richardson, chief analyst for HG Asia in Shanghai. \"Market sentiment is quite strong, people see some hope.\"\nShanghai property developer Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Development Co Ltd, a key market barometer, expected 1996 post-tax profits of 590 million yuan, slightly up from the 585 million yuan in 1995, a company official said on Monday.\nOther major companies including Shanghai Diesel Engine Co Ltd and Shanghai Tyre and Rubber also expected improved results in 1996 compared with 1995, officials said but declined to give details.\n\"The B share companies are expected to perform slightly better than in the past two years thanks to an improvement in the national economy,\" said Jiang Dengfu, a senior B share analyst with Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities.\n\"But improvements in the companies' results are lagging behind the better national economy. A full recovery is expected to start this year,\" he said.\nShanghai's B share firms posted a net year-on-year fall in profit of 13.8 percent in 1994 compared with 1993, and 16.3 percent in 1995 over 1994.\nAnalysts attributed the dismal results, when the Chinese economy as a whole was growing at more than 10 percent per year, largely to poor company management and Beijing's tight credit policy in force since mid-1993.\nHowever, bank interest rate cuts in May and August last year were seen as having relieved much of the pressure.\n\"The firms began improving this year thanks to the bank interest rate cuts,\" said a second analyst. \"Key companies such as Lujiazui also won big loans from the government.\"\nBrokers in southern Shenzhen said they didn't expect a remarkable improvement in the 1996 results of locally-listed B share companies.\n\"But listed firms, especially those with heavy liabilities, may see their operations this year significantly helped by the lower rates because they will lead to lower finance-related costs,\" said one Shenzhen share analyst.\nThe exceptions would largely be firms that ignored the rules and traded heavily and successfully in their own shares, Shenzhen brokers said.\n\"Some public companies reaped huge profits from trading their own shares last year and part of the profits will be calculated into their 1996 profits,\" a broker with Shenzhen J &amp; A Securities Co Ltd said.\nNot all analysts were optimistic of a turnaround in 1996 results.\n\"The results are going to be lousy on balance,\" said stock analyst Alex Conroy with ING-Barings in Shanghai. \"Very few if any of the companies will be able to pull off good results.\"\n", "China extended its campaign to eradicate ideas out of line with Communist Party ideology on Thursday with an order to publishers to issue more good books, no bad books and fewer mediocre books.\nThe directive issued at a meeting called by the China Press and Publications Administration urged a strengthening of professional ethics in China's publishing industry.\nChina's propaganda mandarins have been locked for several months in an authoritarian campaign to stamp out ideas that differ from party precepts, and which has been billed as a drive to promote spiritual civilisation, or civic responsibility.\n\"We should insist on the strategy of publishing the best books,\" said a directive issued by the administration.\n\"We must publish more good books, not publish bad books and minimise publication of mediocre books,\" said the directive issued in the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party.\nThe new directive banned publishing houses from selling off publication codes, without which no book or magazine can be published in China, and from accepting money or other favours from authors in return for printing their works.\n\"We want to publish healthy, useful books that can spread knowledge,\" an administration official said in a telephone interview.\n\"For example, good books are books about science, books that you can learn from,\" an official of one publishing company, said, adding that writings of authors such as former Minister of Culture Wang Meng and urban novelist Wang Shuo were \"good\" books.\n\"Bad books are books that violate policy on religion, are subversive or pornographic or depict violence,\" the administration official said.\nIn recent years, pornographic and violent novels have flooded book stands, commanding an enormous market among Chinese starved of entertainment during Mao Zedong's ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\nPrivate entrepreneurs eager to make money on the flourishing book market have sparked a flourishing sale in publication codes. Every book published in China must have a numbered code.\nAn official of the China Publishers' Association said bad books included those that advocated ethnic separatism -- a problem in restive Tibet and the Moslem Xinjiang region -- and books about China's leaders and which revealed state secrets.\n\"The publishing of too many bad books will affect our national image,\" the association official said.\nOfficials refused to reveal the titles of \"bad\" books named on a list of some 100 publications distributed at this week's meeting.\nHowever, one publisher said \"bad\" books included the highly popular pornographic novel \"Dream of the Rose\" that was published by a private entrepreneur and \"Weird Sex Customs\", a book banned last year after its fantastic description of Islamic life angered China's Moslem minority.\nMediocre, or vulgar books, included martial arts novels and love stories, popular among's China's tens of millions of peasant farmers and migrant rural labourers, the association official said.\nChina this week tightened its grip on the media, with directives on how to write news, ordering journalists not to advocate sex, violence and superstition and to fill their reports with patriotism and socialism.\n", "Britain's building sector has finally shaken off one of its nastiest ailments, with strong evidence that the long and painful decline in the domestic housing market is now over and sales are on the up again.\nBut celebrations failed to break out across the sector.\nHousebuilders may be set to reap the rewards of the recovery, but some of the biggest companies in the building industry on Friday continued to suffer from other afflictions.\nBuilding material giants like RMC Plc, Redland Plc and BPB saw their shares slide heavily on Friday due to continued problems in the key German market plus the pound's relentless rise against the mark and dollar which is eating into valuable export revenues.\nRMC ended 36p lower at 903.5. Redland closed 5.5p weaker at 330, BPB 13p off 362.5p and Blue Circle 7.5p off at 368.\nOptimistic reports of British housing starts at a seven-year high and earlier predictions of 1997 house price inflation of up to 10 percent were overshadowed by concerns about a continued deterioration in German GDP and higher unemployment.\nFor these big building materials firms, analysts say the impact of Germany -- accounting for up to 40 percent of profits -- far outweighs the small upside from the British house sector.\nThe second negative is the 10 percent appreciation in the pound against the mark over the last few months. Companies like Redland have already fired a warning signal on sterling's potential impact on profits.\nUBS building analyst Simon Brown summed up the gloom: \"Only a tiny proportion of the building material sector's business is in the UK. As a total of construction output, UK housing was 14 percent in 1995.\"\nLooking at one of the biggest players in the sector, RMC, Brown said: \"Less than 20 percent of RMC's profit comes from the UK and an even smaller part from UK housing. So it is a tiny proportion of overall earnings.\"\nDowngrades have haunted companies exposed to Germany and the pound. But one player which has escaped the pessimism and is tipped as a \"buy\" in light of the housing recovery is Caradon.\nCaradon is seen as the recovery stock, having slashed around 75 million pounds ($126 million) from costs in the last two years and rationalised its portfolio of businesses.\nIts profits are seen rising sharply this year and next. It has sizeable exposure to the British housing market, through its double glazing window and shower product range. It can also cash in on demand for building material supplies from Britain.\n\"It has the highest proportion of output linked to UK housing,\" said UBS' analyst Brown. \"Hepworth and Marley could also be worth a play,\" he said.\nHoward Seymour, an analyst at brokers BZW, said in a note that he recommended buying Tarmac and Redland -- but that building material firm BPB was classed a \"sell\".\n\"We argue that the sector is displaying late cycle characteristics as speculative supply is following demand which gives a robust profile to recovery over 1997.\"\nHe said that expected rises in British interest rates this year would \"take a back seat to profit recovery. Accordingly, investors should view the UK as their first choice for building materials investment over the next 12 months.\"\nThe main beneficiaries of the house market rebound will be housebuilder specialists. \"Those which were best at buying land will be the most serious winners - Berkeley, Persimmon, Barratt and Beazer,\" said Brown. ($1=.5950 Pound)\n", "After 19 months of sometimes violent confrontations, six striking newspaper unions on Friday made an unconditional offer to return to work at Detroit's two major daily papers.\nAl Derey, head of the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions, said the action was not an act of surrender but a tactic to expose the papers to potentially huge financial losses if they do not agree to a fair contract.\n\"Our position is this strike has not ended. This is simply a new strategy to try to win a fair and decent contract from two corporate giants that don't have any souls,\" a visibly emotional Derey told a news conference.\nAbout 2,500 distribution, pressroom, newsroom and mailroom workers walked off their jobs at the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News in July 1995 after contract talks collapsed.\nThe papers are editorially indepdendent and have separate owners but have been published under a joint operating agreement since 1989.\nKnight-Ridder Inc. owns the Free Press. The News is owned by Gannett Co.

More than 400 of the original strikers have cross picket lines. The papers have hired about 1,400 replacements.\nSince the start of the strike, which has often erupted in violent confrontations between supporters and private security guards, circulation at the papers has fallen 30 percent. Advertising revenues are down between 15 percent and 20 percent.\nDerey told reporters the advertising boycott has cost the papers a combined $250 million, and 700,000 readers have dropped subscriptions. But because the newspapers \"still don't get it,\" he said the unions need to adopt a new strategy.\nIf the papers reject the return-to-work offer, they could be liable for back pay from the time the offer was made if they were found to have commited unfair labor practices, said Derey. That amounts to $250,000 a day, or $1 million a year, he said.\nThe action Friday is a controversial one for many union members, who are staunchly opposed to returning to work. But Derey appealed for their support.\n\"This wasn't the only strategy and it isn't the easiest, but it is the best way we've got to take on these corporate powers and get us moving again down the road to a fair contract,\" he said.\nOne local labor analyst said the union's move was an acknowledgement the strike as a means of leverage has reached the point of diminishing returns. But it does force management to make some difficult decisions.\n\"What the unions are doing now is upping the legal ante,\" said Steve Babson, labor program specialist at Wayne State University's Labor Studies Center.\nIf the papers do not agree to take back all of the striking workers, they could be liable for the back pay penalities if they commited unfair labor practices, a legal process that could take years to resolve, he said.\nThe Detroit regional director of the NLRB has accused the companies of unfair labor practices, finding they did not bargain in good faith. The company appealed that decision to an administrative law judge, who has not yet issued a ruling.\n", "China-controlled China Everbright Holdings Co Ltd emerged from out of the blue on Friday as the new China link for HongKong Telecommunications Ltd, analysts said.\nMonths of suspense were ended earlier when Hong Kong-based conglomerate CITIC Pacific Ltd said it would sell its 7.74 percent stake in Hongkong Telecom to China Everbright, a holding company controlled by China's State Council.\n\"It's not surprising that they will want a minority stake in a large strategic asset like Hongkong Telecom,\" said Andrew Fernow, director of research at Vickers Ballas.\nBut analysts were at a loss to say what China Everbright could bring to Hongkong Telecom.\n\"The biggest question is what edge could China Everbright possibly offer to Hongkong Telecom?\" a China analyst at a European firm said. \"It's like a snake swallowing an elephant.\"\nChina Everbright Holdings has three listed subsidiaries in Hong Kong -- China Everbright International Ltd, China Everbright Technology Ltd and China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd.\nIt is one of 16 equal shareholders in China United Telecommunications Corp (China Unicom), China's second largest telecommunications provider after the powerful Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT).\nUnicom, set up in July 1994 at a total cost of 1.28 billion yuan (or 80 million yuan from each of its 16 partners), provides basic and long-distance telecommunications services, as well as mobile and paging facilities in China.\nIn recent weeks, both Unicom and MPT have been widely tipped as possible China partners of Hongkong Telecom, which as a foreign company is prevented from direct participating in China's telecom market.\nBut Unicom is known to be troubled by a host of problems, ranging from a lack of cash to its well-known friction with MPT. \"Unicom has no money to buy into Hongkong Telecom now,\" an analyst with another European firm said. \"As China Everbright is one of the shareholders in Unicom, it could be buying it first, and Unicom could come into the picture later.\"\nBut while China Everbright had little in terms of assets to bring, it did have the connections in China, one analyst noted.\nZhu Xiaohua, known to be a close associate of China's economic tsar Zhu Rongji, is the chairman of China Everbright.\nHe had been deputy governor of the People's Bank of China and the deputy director of the economics department at the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua news agency prior to joining the China Everbright group in July 1996.\nIn China, however, there was at least one party keenly watching the developments that snowballed in Hong Kong.\nA Unicom source said the company was watching developments but refused to disclose further details.\n\"Ask Everbright, or CITIC,\" the Unicom source said.\n-- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6441\n", "China has issued a call to crack down on independence activities in the restive region of Tibet by exposing the exiled Dalai Lama as a \"fake\" religious leader and pushing ahead with a clean-up of monasteries.\n\"The splittist activities of the Dalai Lama clique are not only a major reason in damaging social stability but also are the biggest impediment to the development and reform of our region,\" the Tibet Daily quoted a senior regional party official as telling a meeting on legal work in the Himalayan region.\nRegional deputy Communist Party secretary Gui Jinlong told the meeting that officials should step up their work to eliminate the influence of the Dalai Lama in the Buddhist region, the newspaper reported in an edition available in Beijing on Monday.\nOfficials had gained many victories in their crackdown on crime and unrest in Tibet last year, but police needed to strike harder at those in the region who wanted independence, he said.\nGuo stressed three main tasks for 1997 to ensure stability in the region, which has been rocked by several anti-Chinese riots in recent years.\nThe first was to deepen criticism of the Dalai Lama, he said, referring to the region's exiled god-king who has won the Nobel Peace Prize for his peaceful campaign for more autonomy for his homeland but who is vilified by Beijing.\n\"(We must) thoroughly expose his pretence of being a 'religious leader' so that all the masses and monks and nuns in the region are clear that the Dalai (Lama) is a political subversive and a religious sham,\" Guo was quoted as saying.\n\"(They) should be clear that the Dalai is a traitor to the motherland, the scum of the people, the chief criminal of religion, and then they will voluntarily oppose splittism and uphold stability,\" Guo said.\nChina blames pro-independence unrest in Tibet on the Dalai Lama, who is revered by most Tibetans as their spiritual and temporal leader and who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising aginst communist rule.\nGuo called on legal officials in Tibet to beef up their struggle against infiltration, in a hint that anti-Chinese feelings among Tibetans had spread among officials appointed by Beijing.\nThirdly, he called for an intensification of instruction about patriotism in Tibet's monasteries and temples.\nHe urged legal workers in the region to take part in rectification work and clean-ups of monasteries to raise vigilance in the region against the \"splittists\" -- Beijing's codeword for people it says are trying to divide Tibet from China.\nAnti-Chinese unrest has erupted sporadically in Tibet since communist troops marched into the region in 1950, with monks and nuns at the forefront of the pro-independence movement.\n", "Bougainville's secessionist rebel leader Francis Ona said he feared his mountainous, jungle-clad South Pacific island would be destroyed by mining if it failed to win independence from Papua New Guinea.\nOna, political leader of the rebels, said in a rare interview aired on Australian radio on Tuesday he believed Papua New Guinea would allow the remote, resource-rich island to be plundered by foreign miners.\n\"Bougainville seems to be on top of a big mineral resource. We truly believe that all the island of Bougainville is under threat of destruction by these foreign companies,\" Ona told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\nPapua New Guinea on Sunday announced it wanted to buy back the foreign interest in Bougainville's giant Panguna copper mine, closed in 1989 after sabotage attacks by rebels.\nPapua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan said the buy-back scheme would result in a financial compensation package for landowners and, along with the hiring of mercenaries, was aimed at ending the nine-year rebellion.\nDevelopment of the mine fuelled secessionist sentiment among Bougainvilleans who felt they were not sharing in its wealth.\nThe mine, which opened in 1972, swelled the Papua New Guinea government's coffers by producing 160,000 tonnes of copper concentrate annually, increasing local resentment on the island. The mine also produced copper and silver.\nOna, president of the rebels' self-declared Bougainville Interim Government, said the Panguna mine would be restarted and four other mines approved if the independence struggle failed.\nHe named four other areas he said were ripe for mining, including Buka, a small island a short canoe ride to the north of Bougainville where Papua New Guinea troops are based.\n\"Without independence Papua New Guinea is going to enforce those five mines on Bougainville,\" Ona said.\nChan has said he wants to buy control of the Panguna mine from global mining group RTZ-CRA, which owns 53.6 percent of the mine operator Bougainville Copper Ltd.\nMining analysts have said it would take three to four years to restart the Panguna mine and that a political solution was essential for any mining activity on Bougainville.\nOna and other rebel leaders were targetted for capture in mid-1996 when the Papua New Guinea government launched an offensive to snatch control of rebel-held areas on the island.\nSince the demise of \"Operation High Speed\", Papua New Guinea has hired a British-based supplier of mercenaries, Sandline International, to train troops for a mission to Bougainville.\nThe presence of 40 mercenaries now in Papua New Guinea has attracted strong criticism from Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the United States and South Africa.\nThe Bougainville conflict has claimed hundreds of lives since sporadic guerrilla warfare first broke out on the island in 1988, and has attracted charges of human rights abuses by both troops and rebels.\n", "An American businessman is plotting a marketing revolution in the hospitality sector and aims to house U.S. pioneers in the China market.\nCorporate housing specialist Howard Ruby says he aims to turn the business of letting serviced apartments into a full-fledged industry that will provide everything from Internet terminals in the home to child care and jobs for expatriate spouses.\nFROM POOR COUSIN OF HOTELS TO A GLOBAL SERVICE\nUntil recently the sector providing ready-to-live-in, service-provided, short-term apartments was a poor cousin of hotels, and in many cities of the world it still is.\n\"This whole industry has been below the radar screen over the last twenty years, being done by a mama and papa, or a small operator that operates one building at a time,\" said Ruby.\n\"And now we're seeing an industry evolve because of the needs of corporate clients as business globalises around the world,\" the head of Los Angeles-based Oakwood International said in an interview at a recent hotel industry conference.\nEYES ON ASIA AND CHINA MARKETS\nRuby's group recently launched a joint venture with a subsidiary of Australia-listed Lend Lease in Singapore with plans to provide 10,000 serviced apartments in Asia, and intends to take aim at London during the next year.\nRuby foresees large-scale expansion in the sector in the Far East, especially in China, with much of American industry abuzz with plans to move people into the region.\nChinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have large expatriate populations as well as large numbers of home-grown professionals moving around the country on assignment who need temporary serviced housing.\n\"I just finished a tour of major client companies in the United States. Every single one is planning an expansion into the Far East, with most of them talking about China.\n\"Telecommunications, software companies, all the way through to clothing and furniture manufacturers. They're all talking China right now. Whereas a company might have sent 10 people last year, they're expecting to send over 20 people this coming year,\" he said.\nThe serviced apartment industry is starting to break away from the niche market identity and family-style business of old into a multifaceted service industry, Ruby believes.\nCORPORATE RELOCATIONS PROVIDE HUGE MARKET POTENTIAL\nOakwood is the largest national provider of serviced apartments in the United States, with offices in 60 cities, more than 17,000 apartments and 25,000 clients including 400 of the Fortune 500 companies and 75 of the world's top multinationals.\nThe potential of the business is highlighted by one client that carries out 50,000 relocations of staff a year, with an average three months stay in temporary housing, Ruby said.\nA company like General Motors, for example, might need help with relocation or temporary housing for staff moved around on training, special projects like setting up new production lines and might put out 25,000 apartment requirements a year.\nRuby started out catering to the niche market of new college graduates three decades ago -- apartments for baby boomers.\nHe moved on to corporate housing when companies asked for more services, such as maid service and taking care of bills.\nSERVICED APARTMENTS TO BECOME MULTIFACETED SERVICE\nHe sees the business progressing to include video conferencing, Internet hookups, sports and recreation facilities, orientation tours, child care and job search agencies for spouses.\n\"This way a serviced apartment offers a branded service dedicated to the needs of the corporate customer. They are not just a physical facility, but a service provider,\" he said.\n\"Companies do not want staff transfers to end in failure because of a dissatisfied spouse. So we want to provide a service that makes a transfer a success.\"\nWith an increasingly cluttered market, customers looked now to a reputable brand as their one point of contact, Ruby said.\nDEALS IN THE PIPELINE IN ASIA\nIn the Far East, Oakwood and partners are working on deals in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manila and Bangkok.\nThe first Asian project to go onstream will be Oakwood Premier, a serviced apartment scheme in Shanghai's historic Xuhui district, where the French concession was located in pre-revolutionary times. The property, owned by a Hong Kong family, will open later this year.\n\"As the industry matures in Asia, dedicated service companies will be the providers of choice for the corporations leasing the majority of serviced apartments,\" Ruby said.\n", "Tabcorp Holdings Ltd managing director Ross Wilson said the betting agency and gaming group was on track to meet its forecasts for the 1996/97 year and was eyeing the New South Wales (NSW) Totalisator Agency Board (TAB).\n\"Typically, you have a slight downturn in the second half, because you haven't got the Spring Carnival,\" Wilson told Reuters in a telephone interview. \"But certainly we are still looking okay and on track for our forecasts for the year.\"\nTabcorp earlier reported a 17.5 percent rise in net profit to A$51.21 million in the six months ended December 31, 1997.  \nWilson said January and February are up on the same period a year earlier but were down on the November and December period.\n\"You always have a downturn in gaming in January, February and March as people flock to the beaches and it has happened again this year,\" said Wilson from Tabcorp's head office in Melbourne.\nTabcorp, which was floated by the state government of Victoria in 1994, reported a net profit of A$87.17 million in the year to June 30, 1996.\nHe said Tabcorp has a strong balance sheet to fund any major acquisitions and maintain high dividend payouts.  \n\"We have no debt, we have about A$90 million in cash and the business is a strong cash flow business so with a balance sheet like that you have significant funding capacity,\" Wilsons said.\nWilson said Tabcorp had a market capitialisation of A$1.8 billion and shareholders funds of A$800 million.\nHe said the group was interested if the NSW government decided to sell its TAB betting business. The Labor government in NSW has yet to say publicly whether it would privatise the TAB, but it is expected to announce plans to sell this year.\n\"Obviously if the terms were right we would be very interested being involved in it,\" he said.  \nWilson said Tabcorp would also be interested in any privatisation by the Queensland government of its TAB business.\nQueensland, New South Wales and Victoria are Australia's three major racing states. He said he did not expect any slowing in the growth rate of Australia's booming gaming industry.\n\"Whilst we have had significant growth over the last few years, both nationally and in Victoria, we see that growth being maintained, with compound growth of 10 percent plus through to at least 2000,\" he said.\nHowever, he said there would be some effect from the opening of the permanment Crown Ltd casino later this year.  \n\"There is no doubt that when you have a brand new venue like the casino opening up and it is very large it will attract a lot of lookers...and it might have some initial impact but we don't think it will have any long term impact,\" Wilson said.\nThe A$1.6 billion Crown casino complex is expected to open in Melbourne around April-May.\nTabcorp surprised the sharemarket last year with a special dividend of 12 cents a share for the 1995/96 second half on top of a 10 cents a share final dividend.\nWilson did not rule out another special dividend in the 1996/97 year.  \n\"We closed last year with A$110 million in cash, we paid something like A$66 million in this last period and...I always said we are happy to pay out a high dividend pay out ratio based on our cash flow forecasts,\" Wilson said.\n\"Then clearly if opportunities do not arise, then we are happy to continue the high pay out ratios,\" he said.\nTabcorp raised its first half dividend to 11 cents a share in the first half, up from nine cents a year earlier.\nTabcorp shares ended six cents lower at A$6.02.\n-- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n", "America Online Inc chairman and chief executive Steve Case said at this time he cannot estimate the financial impact of AOL's plan to provide refunds to customers experiencing problems with its system.\nEarlier, AOL announced a plan to provide refunds and credit, upon request, to its members as a result of its recent negotiations with dozens of state attorneys general. AOL said that it hopes to have a formal agreement in place shortly.\n\"We are not going to estimate any numbers at this point,\" Case told Reuters in an interview.  \nCase said the company is focusing on meeting the needs of its members.\n\"We are doing what is right to meet the needs of our members.

It said that exceptional performances were achieved in in Hong Kong, the U.S., Canada, London and Frankfurt.\nJames Barrington, Cathay's general manager cargo was in a bullish mood.\n\"It has been a great three or four weeks for us. Europe seems to be going longer and stronger than previously predicted, which is good news for us and hopefully for everyone else. Forwarders are telling us that for the first couple of weeks in January, which is traditionally a bad time for us, things are looking quite strong and so the indications are good,\" Barrington said.\nHe also hinted that rates, which are already firm, could rise.\n\"Although nothing is decided yet, in a booming environment it's not impossible that we may see some more rate increases.\" he said.\nAfter a frantic few weeks, trans-Pacific rates are now reported to have dipped back below HK$20 per kg for a 100kg shipment as demand for space eases.\n\"It has been the busiest peak period in the last five years,\" said David Sung, Hong Kong sales manager for one of the biggest trans-Pacific cargo carriers from Hong Kong, Polar Air Cargo.\nLike some other trans-Pacific operators, Polar is also cutting capacity as demand has been dropping by eight to 10 percent every week since the end of November, Sung said.\nThe U.S.-based carrier, which took delivery of its latest Boeing 747-200 freighter in Hong Kong within the past month, said its five flights per week schedule to the U.S. east coast will be reduced to one or two between from December 16 until the new year.\n\"The rush is over. Things are much calmer now on the trans-Pacific after a lot of panic to get goods to the Christmas shops on time,\" said one experienced Hong Kong airfreight forwarder. Unlike recently, when U.S.-bound cargo was taking a few days to clear, trans-Pacific cargo is now being sent on time, he added.\nBut demand for air cargo products in Europe continues apace and the industry is reporting exceptionally good business and backlogs to clear.\nRates to Europe are reported to be holding at around HK$23 to HK$24 per kg for 100 kg, which has pleased airlines ever anxious about disappointing yield levels and which have now managed to restore rates at least to last year's levels.\nAir France Cargo also said the outlook for January is unusually healthy as demand refuses to show signs of flagging.\n\"The situation is very good and I do not understand why. Usually the market goes down in mid-November and is very weak by the start of December,\" said the carrier's regional manager cargo Phillipe Bour.\n\"But we still have a backlog to clear so the market is still there and very strong.

But the peak is very strong for Europe and the UK where backlogs exist,\" he said.\nLufthansa Cargo, which operates a joint freighter service from Hong Kong to Germany with Cathay, said that while an extra Boeing 747 flight introduced had helped with capacity, but demand remained high.\n\"The market is very strong -- stronger than the last two years,\" said Lufthansa Cargo's managing director for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Christian Sedelmaier.\n\"Chinese exports are strong I think because there seems to be quota problems and they want to get goods shipped as quickly as possible,\" he noted.\n\"Another factor is that department stores in Germany, which reduced initial orders, had to use air freight when they re-ordered to get to the shops in time for Christmas. Flights to Europe are full and we have some backlog. Demand is very high and I think the peak will last for another two weeks,\" Sedelmaier said.\nA spokesman for Cargolux, which operates twice-weekly freighters from Hong Kong to Luxembourg via Bangkok and Abu Dhabi, said demand for space is critical with business this year better than last.\nOne factor driving up demand for space has been the sudden cancellation of some flights, he said.\nBritish Airways said it has been able to offer more cargo capacity because of the newly inaugurated, shorter air route to Europe over China which allows less fuel and more cargo to be carried.\n\"Europe is still very, very strong. The last quarter has been extremely strong for BA out of Hong Kong and we are very pleased. We were well above our forecast for November and December is looking very good as well. We see things carrying on all the way up to the Christmas season and after that we'll wait and see how January turns out to be,\" said BA's Pacific regional cargo manager Chris Humphrey.\nHongkong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL), which handles all air cargo to and from territory, reported setting a new handling record of 5,700 tonnes in one day at the end of October.\nHACTL managing director Anthony Charter also told Reuters that initial figures showed there had been a 16 percent increase in year-on-year growth with total throughput during November of 150,000 tonnes.

It is not so busy,\" said Michael Wu, assistant manager cargo sales and reservations in Hong Kong for Japanese carriers All Nippon Airways and all-cargo sister airline Nippon Cargo Airlines (NCA).\nHe blamed the relative weakness of the Japanese yen and that of the country's economy. He also said some Japanese companies have shifted their production from China to other Asian countries, thereby reducing the demand for ex-Hong Kong airfreight.\nNCA operates four weekly Boeing 747-200 freighter flights from Hong Kong to Japan -- two to Tokyo Narita and two to Osaka.\nNCA has also operated 10 extra charter flights over recent months.\nWu said 70-80 percent of the NCA air cargo carried is in transit for trans-Pacific destinations with the remainder bound for the Japanese domestic market.\nFor ANA's daily passenger flights to Tokyo and Osaka, Wu said the situation is reversed, with 70-80 percent of bellyhold cargo destined for the Japanese market.\nHis rates to Japan were stable at between HK$14-15 per kg, which had been unchanged since October, he said.\nHe added that he hoped there might be a rush just before Christmas and before the traditional New Year holiday in Japan.\nFuel surcharges continue to cause controversy in the territory about whether or not they are legal.\nSome airlines, such as Lufthansa Cargo and Air France Cargo, insist the 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo surcharge is legal and have refused to withdraw it.\nBut other airlines heeded a warning letter from Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department after protests from the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, which said any surcharge should be outlawed.\nThe French government is reported to have intervened on behalf of Air France Cargo to obtain a clear ruling from the Hong Kong government.\nAmid all the confusion, many airlines said they have raised their market rates instead.\n-Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017\n", "Canada's top securities regulator and its biggest stock exchange said on Friday they are working on tougher rules for Canada's mining sector -- tarnished at home and abroad by the Busang gold saga.\nThe Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and Toronto Stock Exchange have been under fire since news that Busang may not be the century's richest gold find, rocked the mining world.\nIn a joint statement, the OSC and TSE said a special task force would examine setting new standards for how companies conducted exploration programs and how the results were reported.\n\"We haven't concluded that (new standards are needed), but we feel it's appropriate at this stage to look at the situation,\" said OSC Chairman Jack Geller.\nThe TSE is also considering tightening procedures for listing new companies. Questions have been raised about the due diligence the exchange performed on Bre-X Minerals Ltd. before including it in the key TSE 300 and TSE 100 indices.\nCritics say the controversy swirling around Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X, the discoverer of Busang, has given Canada a black eye.\nBre-X has been under pressure since preliminary tests by its partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. on the Busang gold property indicated the deposit may contain \"insignificant\" amounts of gold.\nThe announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion), or more than 80 percent, off the company's stock market value.\nBre-X has commissioned an independent audit of the Busang project and stood by its estimate of 70.95 million ounces of gold. While investors anxiously await the test results expected in early May, attention has turned to the personal stock trades of top Bre-X officials.\nThe OSC, which is probing Bre-X for possible violation of insider trading and disclosure laws, said on Friday that no Bre-X insiders reported trades last month when the stock collapsed. The Alberta Securities Commission on Friday also reported no activity by Bre-X officials in March.\nAs the OSC/TSE task force gets down to work with a report due in autumn, some foreign miners are already trying to distance themselves from Canada's tarred image.\nIn a statement issued shortly after the Bre-X selloff, U.S.-based Nevada Pacific Mining Co. Inc. said it \"wishes to advise that it has no association with any Canadian based brokerage house, investment bank, or mining analyst, no Canadian based shareholders on its share register, nor is it planning to list on any Canadian stock exchange.\"\nAustralian mining officials said earlier this week the Bre-X situation may not have happened if Canada had adopted mining reporting standards similar to Australia's.\nCanada was the only country \"dragging its feet\" in efforts to have it and the United States, Australia, South Africa and Britain adopt a uniform reporting code, Norman Miskelly, head of an Australian industry reporting standards committee, told Reuters on Tuesday.\nThe OSC's Geller said he doubted Australian standards would have prevented a situation like Bre-X, but acknowledged they needed improvement.\n\"They are somewhat out of date and they are being brought up to date,\" he said.\nGeller rejected criticism that fragmentation among Canada's provinces has made it difficult to get an agreement between the country's five stock exchanges and several securities commissions. Canada has tried for several years to set up one national securities commission.\nMeanwhile, the negative impact on Canada's reputation as an international mining finance center will be short, some analysts predicted on Friday.\n\"Certainly there will be a sting, but Canadian institutions and markets were doing well before Bre-X and they will do well after Bre-X,\" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada in Toronto. \"That Australia is pointing the finger is more boosterism than anything else.\"\nMeanwhile, federal officials said there is no pressure for a federal inquiry into the Busang/Bre-X affair.\nCanada's last major mining inquiry was a Royal Commission probe in the 1960s in which a mining promoter was jailed briefly for stock manipulation linked to worthless samples from a Northern Ontario drill site.\n\"There is absolutely no indication in any way that the federal government has started any investigation,\" said Dale Hull, a department of natural resources official.\n", "British utility Northern Electric pumped up its defence against a takeover bid by Omaha, Neb.-based CalEnergy Inc. Tuesday with promises of higher dividends and unit mergers.\nLast week, CalEnergy raised its bid to 782 million British pounds ($1.29 billion) or 650 pence ($10.55) a share, from 759 million pounds ($1.23 billion), or 630 pence ($10.23) a share.\nNorthern Electric rejected the offer, formally being made by CalEnergy's 70-percent owned British subsidiary, CE Electric UK Plc, after carefull consideration.\nCE Electric has also set a deadline of Dec. 20, just four days after Trade Secretary Ian Lang is expected to decide whether the bid may proceed.\nNorthern Electric said in a statement Monday that it expected a 17 percent rise in its annual dividend to 50 pence (82 cents) per share next year with growth of more than 7 percent from then to the year 2000.\nNorthern Electric added that it planned to merge its electricity supply business with another regional electricity company for cost savings of more than 28 million pounds ($46 million) a year.\n\"It's a fairly aggressive statement from Northern Electric,\" said Yamaichi utilities analyst Nigel Hawkins.\nThe utility, based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, spent 560 million pounds ($920 million) a year ago on a package of shareholder benefits to fight off a takeover bid by construction company Trafalgar House, and has strived to reduce its debt since.\n\"We are saying the company is worth at least as much as we said before ... and clearly it is worth more than 650 pence per share,\" Northern Electric Chairman David Morris said in an interview.\nMorris said Northern Electric would have a \"broadly equal partnership\" in its plans for merging its electricity supply business with another firm. He declined to name the utility involved in talks but said it \"may well not be a nearby one.\"\nNeighbouring Yorkshire Electricity earlier Tuesday said in an interview that it had not held talks with Northern on the issue.\nNorthern Electric has said a price of 700 pence ($11.50) was indicated before CE Electric launched its bid, a claim which the Americans have consistently denied.\nNorthern Electric rushed out half-year results at the end of November and said its debt position should ease to around half previous expectations by March 1997 as it pushed for an increase in CE Electric's bid price.\n\"This is an exercise in re-arranging the deckchairs on the good ship 'Scorched Earth,'\" said a spokesman for CE Electric, which has already secured 33.27 percent of its target.\nNorthern Electric is just the latest British regional electric company to become a takeover target.\nSeven of the original 12 cash-rich regional electricity companies set up in a 1990 privatisation have already been snapped up by predators, three going to U.S. companies.\nOf the remaining five, East Midlands Electricity has agreed to a $2.15 billion takeover by Dominion Resources Inc. of Richmond, Va., while talks between U.S.-based Entergy Corp. of New Orleans and London Electric were called off last month.\n", "London will defend its share of foreign exchange trading once a single European currency comes into being, according to Judith Mayhew, who became the new head of the Corporation of London on Thursday.\n\"We must maintain our market share at all costs,\" Mayhew, who was elected as chairman of the Corporation's policy and resources committee, told Reuters in an interview. The body is the local authority for London's traditional financial hub.\nMayhew, a 48-year-old New Zealander who has lived and worked in the City of London since 1976, said the Corporation faces three main challenges. She sees the first as the body's survival to make sure it continues to represent the views of the City.\nHer second challenge is to ensure that \"when the euro is introduced the City of London is the primary market (for it)\" while the third is to ensure LIFFE, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, dominates the derivatives market for the European single currency.\nWhile Mayhew did not give her view on whether she would rather see the pound in or out of a the single currency, she said it was important for Britain to remain at the negotiating table for as long as possible while deciding its own approach.\nAnd whatever Britain's attitude, the Corporation will work closely with Europe on technical aspects of its introduction.\nIf the trading of the euro is split more evenly between Europe's main financial centres, the only places to benefit will be New York and Tokyo which will lap up London's business, she said. And one of the Corporation's main aims is to increase the number of global banking headquarters within the Square Mile.\nMayhew said that regardless of the colour of the next British government -- the ruling Conservative party must hold an election by May -- the Corporation will continue to lobby for the right taxation levels and employee costs.\nIt will also look closely at the outflow of its revenue to the rest of Britain.\n\"Perhaps the balance is not right,\" she said. The body keeps only a tenth of its 700 million pound ($1.18 billion) revenue.\nShe believes London's strength comes from its international business, not from its domestic business and this makes it the ideal site for Europe's financial capital. She would have liked the future European Central Bank to have been here rather than Frankfurt but noted London already has the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).\nMayhew said the Corporation would continue to support the local authorities in surrounding boroughs, both through charitable work and other projects in deprived areas.\n\"It is an irony that we have got perhaps the richest part of Europe surrounded by some of the poorest parts,\" she said.\nAs long as there remained a threat of bomb attacks on the City of London, Mayhew said the so-called \"ring of steel\" erected to deter attacks by IRA guerillas would continue.\nShe described competition for prime investment banking tenants with the Docklands area to the east of the City as a healthy rivalry and welcomed the extra office space provided by the vast modern redevelopment of the former docks site.\n\"The City would like to remain dominant in keeping the primary markets together,\" Mayhew said, adding such close proximity was important to the way people worked.\nAnd she welcomed a recent resurgence in London's property market, \"It is very good that the cranes are overhead in the City again and there is more development. Modern cities need modern office space,\" she said.\n($1=.5958 Pound)\n", "Liggett Group's pact breaking away from other cigarette makers has failed to shake the confidence of tabacco growers in North Carolina, where the crop has been king for centuries.\n\"Tobacco farmers will continue to have a market, regardless of the success or failure of the suits,\" North Carolina State Attorney General Mike Easley said.\nTobacco is North Carolina's single biggest crop and the plant's broad, brown leaves sustain thousands of manufacturing, financial and other jobs.  \n\"Tobacco supports 200,000 families in North Carolina,\" said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for state Gov. Jim Hunt.\nNorth Carolina is America's biggest producer of tobacco. Tennessee, Virgina, South Carolina, Kentucky and Georgia are also major tobacco-growing states.\nThe maker of Chesterfields and L&amp;M branded cigarettes, Liggett last week rocked the tobacco business and Wall Street by agreeing to settle lawsuits with 22 state attorneys general.  \nLiggett promised to pay 25 percent of its pre-tax profits for the next quarter century and label its cigarettes as addictive substances. It also agreed to hand over to the attorneys general internal documents which might bolster multi-billion dollar claims against other cigarette makers.\nNo cigarette company but Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group, has made such a deal. Other cigarette makers, such as Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, fiercely condemned the pact.  \n\"It'll give everybody something to talk about, but I don't think it will cause any adverse effects in the short term,\" said William Graham, a retired Farm Credit Services loan officer in Proctorville, in southeastern North Carolina.\n\"I just don't think people are aware of just how much tax money tobacco generates in this country,\" Graham said.\n\"What I want to say is not fit to print,\" said tobacco grower Grady Britt of Broad Ridge, also in southeastern North Carolina, where tobacco has been a mainstay for more than 200 years.  \nOther growers worried that the Liggett pact was another sign that tobacco, also a major export accounting last year for about 20 percent of the U.S. net agricultural trade surplus, was headed for hard times.\n\"The government's going to take tobacco away from us, but they aren't going to give anything back,\" said Newberry Mitchell, a grower since the early 1960s.\n\"All this decision is going to do is give the government more ammunition to classify tobacco as a drug and regulate it,\" said Erskine Floyd, another grower who lives in Barnesville, North Carolina.\nEasley, the North Carolina attorney general, has not filed a lawsuit against cigarette makers and said the settlement on Thursday was less important than it appeared.\nHe described Liggett, the fifth-ranked cigarette maker with only a sliver of the market, as a minor industry player and said the legal grounding for the lawsuits by the attorneys general was shaky.\n", "Tobacco companies could face a double-digit drop in U.S. sales when they pass on the cost of a possible $300 billion deal to settle massive legal claims.\nAnalyst Gary Black of Sanford Bernstein said U.S. consumption would drop about 12 percent, based on the experience of past price increases.\nBut industry analysts also said Thursday the reported $300 billion paid over 25 years was probably on the high side.\n\"It's much too high. I think it's an opening shot by the anti-tobacco lobby,\" said Martin Feldman of Smith Barney.  \nThe talks to end government, individual and class-action suits seeking billions of dollars in damages cover proposals for a $300 billion fund for sick smokers; sharp limits on advertising; and regulation of tobacco by the Food and Drug Administration.\nA deal may take weeks or months, but passage by Congress of laws sheltering the industry from lawsuits will probably take a year or two, analysts said. Some anti-tobacco senators in Washington have already questioned the terms.  \nA 12 percent drop would cut industry leader Philip Morris' pre-tax profits by about $500 million a year and the profits of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp -- the second largest U.S. cigarette maker -- by some $170 million, Sanford Bernstein's Black said.\nRoy Burry, analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, said the price rises would likely be gradual, costing the industry only $6 billion in the first year after a deal and the effects would vary from company to company.\nShipments at Philip Morris, with its market-dominant Marlboro brand, would fall only about six percent.  \n\"We would start with a 25 cent initial increase, or 10-15 percent, and a six percent decline in volume,\" he said of Philip Morris.\nFeldman said in a report that cigarette consumption is not necessarily controlled by prices. In many countries, taxes constitute a much greater share of retail prices than in the United States. Taxes on a typical 20 cigarette pack account for 29 percent of the retail price in the U.S., but for 77 percent in Ireland, 74 percent in Australia and 56 percent in Canada.\nThe analysts said a global settlement, even with a $300 billion price tag, would raise the value of tobacco properties because many legal worries would have been cleared away.\nBlack expected that, over time, Philip Morris would rise to around 60 from 42-1/4 on Thursday and RJR Nabisco to 48 from 32-3/4.\nFeldman agreed, saying: \"The businesses will remain very profitable and the legal risks that have been keeping valuations down will have disappeared.\"\n-- Miami newsroom 305-374-5013.\n", "Australia's largest contruction group Leighton Holdings Ltd is expected to report a jump of more than 20 percent in pre-abnormal net profit for the six months ended December 31 when it reports on Thursday, analysts said.\nAnalysts contacted by Reuters forecast Leighton would report a pre-abnormal net of between A$33 million and A$35 million for the 1996/97 first half.\nLast year, Leighton, which is about 46 percent owned by German construction group Hochtief AG, reported a net profit of A$27.10 million for the 1995/96 first half.  \nThe expected stronger profit is also likely to see the first half dividend raised to between 7.5 and 8.5 cents a share from 6.5 cents a year earlier.\n\"They should have a good result out of Asia, contract mining should continue to throw up good results and the casino should make a reasonable contribution,\" said John North, an analyst with brokers J.B.

In future they would need permission, and police could refuse it.\nSunny Loh, a political analyst at Hong Kong University, told Reuters the biggest impact would be the ban on foreign funding for Hong Kong political organisations, many of which, such as the popular Democratic Party, raise money abroad.\n\"It's a retrograde step... Local groups will have to deal with their relations with foreign countries very carefully,\" he said. \"There will be more sensitivity to demonstrations, protests and petitions because they will be seen to affect national security.\"\nThis would cut the risk of foreign groups using Hong Kong as a base to subvert China, Loh said. Behind China's concern is a long history of groups doing just that.\nLaw professor Nihal Jayawickrama said China wanted to keep a close eye on pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong, and the changes would lead to inspections of their accounts for foreign links.\n\"How do you make sure they are not being influenced in their thinking by foreign forces? ...They'll have to scrutinise the parties' accounts for foreign funding,\" he said.\nIn the late 19th century Hong Kong became a base of the nationalist revolutionaries who plotted and overthrew the last imperial dynasty in 1911, creating China's first republic.\nEven the Communists, before they came to power in 1949, sometimes used Hong Kong as an offshore venue for meetings beyond the reach of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist regime on the mainland.\nChina also has vivid memories of the 1989 democracy movement which its tanks bloodily crushed in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.\nThe movement received material support from Hong Kong political and business groups, as well as information support through a \"fax war\" from groups based abroad.

The GDP of Shenzhen alone was 95 billion yuan, accounting for more than half the total, while growth in the boomtown across the border from Hong Kong was 16.4 percent.\nFastest growing of the four was Xiamen, which posted a sizzling 19.25 percent, while the slowest was Zhuhai with growth of 8.9 percent.\nThe special economic zones, a brainchild of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and set up in the early 1980s to open China's doors to the West, had suffered because the technological level of their industry was not high, the official of the SEZ office said.\n\"Of the projects they are able to attract, high-technology ones account for a low proportion,\" he said. \"Most are still labour-intensive processing projects.\"\nThe average industrial output growth of the four was 17.49 percent in 1996, with total output value of 218.9 billion yuan.

Zhuhai recorded the smallest amount of trade at $4.949 billion but the fastest growth of 30.17 percent.\nHowever, foreign investment showed negative growth in the four zones -- both new contracts signed and investment amount.\nThe SEZ official attributed the slowdown to a better understanding of China among foreign investors, which meant that while the contracts were fewer in number, they were more likely to result in actual inflows of investment.\n\"More contracts that are signed actually go ahead,\" he said.\nContracts signed totalled 2,129 in 1996, or 21.93 percent negative growth, while their value was $5.948 billion, or 21.59 percent negative growth.\nShenzhen showed the sharpest drop, with the number of new contracts falling 38.8 percent and value slashed 51.5 percent.\nHowever, actual foreign investment rose in all four zones with Shenzhen showing the biggest growth of 56.6 percent and Xiamen the smallest at 2.16 percent.\n($1.0=8.3 yuan)\n-- Beijing newsroom (8610) 65321921\n", "Midwest regional banks should continue their trend of low double-digit earnings growth in the 1997 first quarter, with expense control, steady loan growth and share buybacks pacing results.\n\"We ought to see more of what we've been seeing -- slow loan growth, good expense control and share buybacks\" boosting earnings per share, Michael Ancell, banking industry analyst at Edward D.

We're awaiting a submission on it and we'll be doing market inquiries,\" Fels said.\nFels said the earlier informal talks occurred in September 1995 when Westpac sought ACCC for approval for its takeover of Perth-based Challenge Bank.  \n\"During that time we discussed with Westpac wider issues about regional mergers in general. Obviously that touched on wider possibilities then just Westpac-Challenge,\" Fels said.\n\"We then issued a statement which by implication made it look as if we would have quite a bit of hesitation about Westpac-Bank of Melbourne, however there was no formal proposal put to us,\" he said.\n\"At that time we would have been hesitant had a formal proposition been put.\"  \nFels said, however, the commission took the unusual step of saying that this hesitation about Westpac-Bank of Melbourne only applied at that time.\n\"We did say at the time very explicitly that this was our view at THAT time,\" he said.\n\"We said that a couple of times, we don't normally say that sort of thing.\n\"We were signalling that we were aware that this matter would at some point have to be looked at again because people keep arguing that there's been structural change in the market.\"  \nFels was careful not to state whether he thought there had been structural change since 1995.\n\"That's what's been put to us by the parties,\" he said.\n\"There've been changes (generally), but we haven't really evaluated their impact,\" he said, adding he remained neutral on the question of structural change.\nBut later he told ABC radio he did not agree currently with those arguing there had been relevant, significant structural change in the regional banking sector.\n\"The question is: has there been a change of circumstance.  \n\"The parties argue 'Yes.' We haven't, certainly, taken that view at this time but we will look at their submissions,\" he said.\nFels said it would take the ACCC at least a month to make its decision and would take the Wallis inquiry's report into account, but would not be bound by it.\nEarlier Westpac said it would present a strong case that the takeover was pro-competitive.\nThe two banks said they would merge their retail operations in Victoria and trade under the Bank of Melbourne brand name with local management.  \n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n", "Chinese Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin has wooed Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties to come up with constructive suggestions on reunification of the two sides, split by civil war almost five decades ago.\n\"We welcome Taiwan's various political parties...to exchange views with us on relations between the two sides and on constructive suggestions about peaceful reunification,\" Jiang told a government advisory body on New Year's Day.\nChinese newspapers carried the full text of Jiang's speech on Thursday.\nEarlier this week, Jiang made a similar overture, but he made no mention of the island's political parties, instead referring to Taiwanese from all walks of life.\nTaiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, which fled into exile on the island after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, says it is committed to reunification but is in no hurry to do so. Taiwan insists on reunification under freedom and democracy and a free market economy.\nThe island's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party has called for \"self-determination\", or letting Taiwan's residents decide for themselves whether to reunify or declare independence.\nChina, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province, has threatened to invade if the island declares independence.\n\"Taiwan is our country's sacred territory,\" Jiang said.\n\"We hope the Taiwanese authorities...will stop all activities splitting the motherland and take realistic action to improve relations between the two sides,\" he said.\nTensions between Beijing and Taipei began to ease in the late 1980s, but relations plunged after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a trip to the United States in a bid to break the island out of diplomatic isolation imposed by China.\nTies deteriorated further last March when China conducted war games and missile tests close to Taiwan in the run-up to the island's historic presidential elections. China frowns on Western-style democracy.\nAnalysts said Jiang was eager for reunification to secure his place in modern Chinese history alongside Mao Zedong, who established the People's Republic, and Deng Xiaoping, who cemented the return of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in mid-1997.\nJiang, the anointed successor of Deng, China's 92-year-old paramount leader, is seen by some Western analysts as merely a transitional figure and he has struggled to shake off that image.\nJiang's call on Taiwan to come up with suggestions on ways to reunify could go unanswered again, one Chinese analyst said.\nChina has been bitter since Taiwan ignored Jiang's 1995 \"eight point\" proposal on reunification, in which he called for leaders of the two sides to exchange visits.\nJiang was seen by some in the military and the Communist Party as weak after his earlier call for reunification fell on deaf ears, analysts said.\nHis latest overture to Taiwan could backfire and be used by his political opponents to attack him, another analyst said.\n", "Chinese police cordoned off a South Korean embassy compound and North Korean diplomats waited outside as a senior Seoul official began talks in Beijing on the apparent defection of a top Pyongyang official.\nKim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha, arrived in Beijing and sat down at once for talks with Chinese officials on the diplomatic crisis, South Korean embassy officials said.\nChinese police blocked streets to Seoul's consular section in the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, and embassy officials said Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, and his assistant were inside.\nHwang, 73, is one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, and would be the highest ranking official from the world's last Stalinist state to seek asylum in the South.\nChina avoided direct comment after finding itself in the eye of a diplomatic storm involving its old communist comrade, Pyongyang, and new commercial ally, Seoul, and chose instead to appeal for calm.\n\"Regarding the passage through Beijing city by Hwang Jang-yop, we were not notified in advance,\" a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.\n\"We hope the parties concerned can deal with this matter calmly and on the basis of the overall circumstances, and appropriately handle this in the interests of the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula,\" she said.\nIn a sign of the suspicion that underscores dealings between North and South, South Korean embassy officials accused North Koreans of trying to force their way into the consular office and had called for Chinese police protection.\nDiplomats from Pyongyang sat in parked cars outside the consular compound and waited outside the embassy, watching from behind the police cordons.\n\"Last night, North Korean people who we believe were from the embassy tried to enter our consular section,\" embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik told reporters. Chinese police on guard prevented the North Koreans from entering, he said.\n\"We have asked the Chinese government to protect our embassy compound... against North Koreans and any unexpected (incidents),\" he said.\nHe dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, had been kidnapped by the South, saying Hwang had voluntarily sought asylum.\n\"He came by taxi without any notice,\" Chang said.\nNorth Korean diplomats stood by the kidnapping charge.\n\"I think South Korea has kidnapped these two officials,\" said one of several North Korean officials waiting in the office tower housing Seoul's embassy. \"The impossible has happened.\"\nAn official at the North Korean embassy repeated a Pyongyang Foreign Ministry statement that accused Seoul of kidnapping Hwang and urged Beijing to sort out the mess.\n\"If it is brought to light that the South Korean authorities kidnapped him and describe him as seeking 'asylum', we will regard it as a serious incident without precedent and take due countermeasures,\" the Korean Central News Agency quoted a Pyongyang Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.\n\"We expect that the Chinese side will take appropriate measures in this regard,\" the spokesman added.\nSouth and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953.

The last part of the three way split-up will be around the end of 1996, when shareholders receive stock in computing company NCR.\nExisting shareholders on Sept. 30 will receive one new Lucent share for about every three AT&amp;T shares they hold, and if they intend to hold both stocks, they need do nothing.\nBut the confusion arises because of the necessity to create two new classes of stock -- one for the rump portion of AT&amp;T and one for Lucent -- in the weeks leading up to the  Sept. 30 split.\nThe New York Stock Exchange said that these classes of temporary \"when issued\" stock -- which are rights to the respective new shares -- will effectively form a market in the new companies before formal trading begins.\n\"AT&amp;T has done a pretty good job of keeping people informed. But inevitably there will be some confusion,\" said Michael Macleod, a vice president and partner at Shareholders Communications Corp., which specializes in shareholder issues and odd-lot stock programs.\nFor example, someone selling 100 AT&amp;T shares between Sept. 17 and 30 will in effect be selling rights to 100 new AT&amp;T shares, and rights to just over 30 Lucent shares, although the total proceeds will be the same.\nBuyers in that period will be able roughly to reconstruct the old AT&amp;T by buying rights in the same 100 to 30 proportion, or they can buy AT&amp;T or Lucent rights as they see fit. Sellers also can dispose of rights to just one stock and keep the other during that period.\nNo date has yet been set for the creation of the \"when issued\" stock. AT&amp;T \"when issued\" will be allocated the trading symbol T wd.N, a NYSE spokesman said.\nIt will not entitle you to any Lucent shares, nor to AT&amp;T's regular 33-cent quarterly dividend, even if it is possible to buy it before the AT&amp;T dividend record date of Sept. 12. On Sept. 30, the AT&amp;T stock symbol will revert to T.N.\nThe \"when issued\" stock in Lucent (LU wi.N) will carry no rights to Lucent's dividend of 7-1/2 cents a share even if it starts trading before the record date of Sept. 12. At Sept. 30 it will revert to the stock symbol LU.N.\nThe worst confusion will come for those people who still own stock from the pre-1984 split-up of the Bell system.\n\"A majority of shareholders -- though representing a small minority of the overall stock held -- still have the original pre-1984 AT&amp;T stock which includes rights to regional Bells,\" said AT&amp;T spokeswoman Eileen Connolly.\nIf these shareholders want to sell, working out the stock rights and especially the costs for capital gains taxes, could be very complex.\nAT&amp;T's 24-hour shareholder information line is 1-800-756-8500.\n", "Australia's biggest bank, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), said on Thursday it would consider any opportunity to merge with a local life office.\nManaging director Don Argus told Reuters that NAB remained an acquisitive bank, even though its hands were tied on mergers with other major domestic rivals by government policy.\n\"That's an option, yes, because we have a liability driven strategy,\" he said when asked if NAB would consider merging with a domestic life office or forming an alliance with one.\nNAB has placed heavy emphasis on asset growth, but it is now trying hard to grow the deposit side of its business.

Axiom was sold for A$240 million to London-based funds group Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.\n\"We have been an acquisitive bank for something like 10 years and our strategy is well known -- it's opportunity and price,\" Argus said.\nAustralia's life offices have begun to compete with banks in lending, in line with the global convergence of financial service industries.\nUnder revised government policy announced in April, the nation's two major life offices, the Australian Mutual Provident Society and National Mutual Holdings Ltd, are allowed to merge with any of the major banks.\nNational Mutual is controlled by French insurer Axa SA\nOther major life offices are Colonial Ltd, which lists on the Australian Stock Exchange next week, and Mercantile Mutual, a unit of ING Group NV.\nEarlier on Thursday, NAB announced a 14.1 percent jump in half year net profit to A$1.14 billion but said it faced increasing competitive pressures. Even so, Argus said NAB hoped to achieve at least match this record result in the second half.\nArgus was also critical of government policy on financial sector reform, saying delays in finalising the new rules were making the local big banks takeover targets for foreign competitors.\nNAB, which has profitable bank operations in the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand, was a keen supporter of allowing big bank mergers in its submission to the Wallis inquiry into the financial system.\nIn its response to the Wallis report, the national government said on April 9 that it would not allow mergers among the big four banks at the moment but would permit them to merge with major life offices and would also permit takeovers by foreign banks.\nNAB, the largest and most profitable of Australia's private banks with an asset base of nearly A$190 billion, ended Thursday trade with a market capitalisation of A$27.1 billion.\nIt overshadows the other three banks, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd which are valued at between A$12.6 billion and A$13.7 billion.\n-- Mark Bendeich, Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421\n", "Northern England's glittering record of inward investment was tarnished this week by news of 1,300 jobs being axed at Ford Motor Co's Halewood plant, denting the region's record of attracting foreign firms.\nCheap local labour, flexible employment rules and government laws to keep trade unions on a tight leash have all combined to entice foreign investors into northern England.\nThe long list includes companies like Japan's Nissan Motor Co, Germany's Siemens, South Korea's Samsung Co and General Motor Co's British unit Vauxhall.\nPrime Minister John Major said the cuts went against the trend.

Ellison's stake in Oracle is worth about $6 billion.\nApple rose $2.25 to $19, while Oracle fell $1.125 to $39.375 on Nasdaq, where both stocks were among the most active issues in late trading.\nEllison told the newspaper he was publicly reasserting his interest in buying Apple partly to gauge investor support in the next few days. Based on the reaction, he will decide soon whether to make a bid.\nPreviously, he has said he approached unidentified big investors about a joint bid. He also has mulled the idea with his friend Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who was kicked out of the company in 1985 and returned in December as a part-time advisor to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio.\nEllison could not be reached for comment.

But the tender was later cancelled when Czech competition authorities found irregularities in the process.\nVyborny said a commission set up to evaluate binds in the latest tender had actually put Unisys narrowly ahead of EDS-Digital. But the ministry had decided to ignore its recommendation due to the consortium's lower price and greater experience, he told an news conference.\nJan Vesely, director of the Czech unit of Unisys, said his company would first appeal directly to the ministry. \"In the event of a negative answer, there is the Economic Competition Office,\" he said.\nUnisys said the EDS bid did not cover all the components which were required. EDS officials in Prague declined to comment and ministry officials were not contactable.\nA number of other Czech military tenders have been marked by controversy, sometimes amid allegations of graft.\nInstallation of the staff information system is a large step on the Czech army's path to compatibility with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's military command.\nNATO leaders will decide in July which former communist countries will be invited to join the alliance. The Czech Republic is a front runner along with Poland and Hungary.\nVyborny said EDS-Digital had put in a bid of 1.295 billion crowns while Unisys was nearly 109 million crowns more expensive.\nThe tender commission, which rated the bids but was not authorised to take any decision, put Unisys marginally ahead of EDS. Both were well ahead of International Business Machines Corp and Deloitte and Touche unit IDOM.\n\"(The bids of) two companies, Unisys and EDS, are in technical terms almost identical. In price terms, without question, the best bid was submitted by EDS,\" Vyborny said. \"The experience of EDS-Digital with staff information systems is greater. It is a bid offering a well-tested system which EDS has implemented in 14 NATO countries,\" he added.\nUnisys said it was suspicious that the original tender was abolished and rankings were changed when it won again.\n\"We consider this decision on ranking in the public tender to be unobjective and unjustified, and we will surely appeal against it,\" the Unisys statement said.

Many are happy to break even or lose money for many years in order to gain market share.\nThe Canadian insurance company Manulife Financial, for instance, which set up a joint venture last month, said it doesn't expect to see a profit for at least seven years.\n", "A group of U.S. and European firms on Tuesday revealed they had developed a system for money transactions over the Internet.\nThe team, which includes AT &amp; T Corp Unisource, Apple Computer Inc, Nokia Oy and Mondex UK, will run the project on a pilot basis.\n\"We have developed protocols for shopping and banking that allow users to pay for electronic services via the Internet,\" Julian Wilson, Unisource's director of service development told a briefing.\nWilson said he believed the system, involving the transfer of electronic cash from one device to another, was \"a world first\".\nThe developers of the system said it was the world's first trial of \"an innovative concept for fast and safe money transactions over the Internet\" and would use the GSM network for Internet access.\nThe system aims to allow Internet users to buy services and access information using so-called \"smart cards\" such as that developed by Mondex the electronic cash-card company.\nWilson said banks were top of the list of possible users for the system, pointing out the economies of internet banking compared to traditional retail banking which has to pay the cost of maintaining a branch network.\n\"The economic justification for banks is significant,\" he said, adding that the system would give users a direct connection to their bank and cash could then be issued onto the card.\nThe initial pilot is being carried out with National Westminster Bank Plc, he said.\nAs well as banking, another key use for this system was to pay for information, anonymously, on the Internet, without having to reveal credit card details.\nWilson said the project was effectively putting cash registers and ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) onto the Internet.\nUsers will be able to use handheld network computers, such as Apple's MessagePad 2000 with built-in GSM and Internet access, to make use of the system.\nCraig Sears-Black, head of Apple's information appliances division, said \"The project is going to be a trial which tells us what the future holds for this type of transaction over the Internet\".\nHe said the protocols developed were the first to make very low cost transactions, such as retrieving restaurant reviews or individual newspaper articles, viable.\nIn Britain, the trial is teaming up with London listings magazine Time Out, which will sell on-line information on restaurants and entertainment.\nIt is also going to be connected to a map service provided by Multimedia Mapping which will give users precision maps directly relating to the Time Out information.\n", "Embattled Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel Plc assured investors on Monday that the financial fallout from last November's fire would not hit its debt rescue plan or derail long-term growth.\n\"The board...believes that the November fire should not have any significant effect on the long-term financial performance of the company, nor will there be any need to review the financial restructuring plan,\" said Eurotunnel in a statement.\nThe blaze swept through one of the cross-channel tunnels, causing a partial shutdown and reduced services. But Eurotunnel gave evidence that sales had survived the fire, with passenger numbers sharply up and the outlook for 1997 encouraging.\nRichard Hannah, analyst at UBS, said: \"The fact that the refinancing will not have to be restructured is the key message for investors.\"\nA special shareholder meeting had been due in April to consider the debt refinancing, which was clinched in October. But Eurotunnel said it had now delayed that to June when full services would resume once tunnel repairs had been completed.\nEurotunnel said its banking syndicate had used the delay to ask the remaining syndicate of bankers to extend the debt standstill arrangement to December. It began in September 1995 and runs for 18 months.\nEurotunnel chairman Patrick Ponsolle also said he hoped to agree details of the debt deal with its steering group of banks before March. Ponsolle was speaking to Reuters before a news briefing on the year's outlook in Folkestone, England.\nIn the first major trading review since the fire, Eurotunnel reported that unaudited estimated turnover for 1996 was 450 million pounds ($752.5 million), up from 300 million in 1995.\nThe group said the sales growth was achieved \"despite a substantial loss of revenue in the last seven weeks (of 1996)\".\nThirteen million passengers travelled through the tunnel last year by the Le Shuttle car service or the Eurostar passenger trains, up from eight million the previous year.\nThe board described the outlook for 1997 as encouraging as the cross-channel ferry industry was cutting capacity in a move which holds out the prospect of firmer pricing.\nEurotunnel believes that once full services resume by June it should be able to raise its market share in the second half.\n\"This market share should be comparable to, if not higher than, autumn 1996, and revenues at the end of this year should be higher than at the end of 1996,\" it said.\n\"As expected, Eurotunnel has provided a morale booster,\" said Hannah. Growth in sales was in line with expectations. Passenger numbers had been expected to increase after a change of ownership in the Eurostar passenger train service last April.\nIt was taken over by London and Continental Railways with the aim of raising sales dramatically.\nLooking at a breakdown of the latest Eurotunnel traffic data, Eurostar increased passenger numbers by 67 percent to 4.86 million for the full year, and by 69 percent for the 11 months up to the November fire which led to a temporary closure.\nLe Shuttle car tourist traffic rose 70 percent to 2.07 million cars in 1996, with bus traffic up 148 percent to 57,692 coaches. Le Shuttle freight traffic was up 33 percent to 519,003 trucks for the year.\nEurotunnel shares edged up 1/2 pence to 76-1/2 in London and rose 10 centimes to 7.00 francs in Paris.\n($1=.5979 Pound)\n", "Toronto's key stock index soared to close more than one percent higher on Monday but the broader market ended mixed as gold issues slipped on weaker bullion prices.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index jumped 69.47 points, or 1.1 percent, to 6144.25.\nTrading was moderately heavy  at 89.8 million shares worth C$1.72 billion ($1.25 billion).\nDespite broad gains, declining issues still outnumbered advances 488 to 465 while 286 stocks were unchanged.\n\"Quite a blue chip rally,\" remarked portfolio manager Josef Schachter, head of Schachter Asset Management.\nSchachter said investors concluded Canada's largest equities market had fallen enough in recent weeks to account for a 25-basis-point hike in U.S. short-term interest rates.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise rates at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday.\nInvestors are saying \"okay, we can get a quarter point, we can live on that,\" Schachter said.\nOf Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 12 posted gains led by financial services, pipelines, consumer products and media.\nThe only two weak sectors were gold and real estate.\nBullion prices ended weaker on Monday with Comex April gold down US$2.60 at US$350.40 an ounce.\nHot stocks included Bre-X Minerals Ltd. which led heavy traders and closed up 0.50 at 15.70 on volume of six million shares.\nThe Calgary-based gold prospector on Monday defended the accuracy of assay results and resource calculations for the Busang gold find in Indonesia.\nDoubts about the size of the discovery pushed Bre-X shares to a 52-week low of 14.25 on Friday.\nIn other Bre-X news, U.S. brokerage Lehman Brothers cut its rating on the stock to neutral from outperform.\nAnother active issue was forestry firm Avenor Inc., adding 1.45 to close at 24 on 567,000 shares.\nAvenor said on Monday that it will refuse a merger proposal from Domtar Inc. and will instead focus on a merger with Repap Enterprises Inc.\nBut the Avenor/Repap deal was put in doubt on Monday after Canada's largest pension fund, Caisse de depot et placement, gave the deal a thumbs down.

Will a power struggle brew behind the scenes among those eager to succeed Deng as China's de facto emperor?\nThe world will be watching to see which way China's political winds blow -- and how the leadership copes with a plethora of problems from unemployment, a widening gap between rich and poor, corruption and a one-party system.\n\"I don't think there will be an immediate power struggle,\" one Western diplomat said on Thursday. \"The immediate concern will be to present a face of calm, stability and normality.\"\nDeng died late on Wednesday of respiratory failure -- a complication from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection.

Gloucester is not fully into its swing,\" Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Brian Pitman told reporters at a news conference.\"\nPitman expects cost savings of 400 million pounds every year from the merger and from the purchase of the 38 percent minority interest in Lloyds Abbey Life completed last year.\nThe 1996 profit figure followed 1.650 billion pounds the previous year. Lloyds TSB raised its dividend by 20 percent to 13.2 pence per share from 11p, while earnings per share soared by 63 percent to 31.2p from 21.3.\nBut banking analysts said the headline data flattered the bank's underlying performance somewhat and expressed some concern for future income growth. Lloyds shares eased 7p to 485 but later improved to stand a net 2p higher by 1600 GMT at 504p.\n\"There's nothing really wrong with the results,\" said John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. \"But they are not as glorious as they look on the surface.\"\nAnalysts pointed out that the large drop in bad debt provisions -- 44 percent down to 327 million pounds -- was a surprise, even though some improvement was expected given that the bank has increased higher quality assets such as mortgages.\n\"Bad debts were much lower than expected,\" said Nick Collier, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, \"and there was a bigger return from problem country debt.\"\nSpecific provisons for bad and doubtful debts were down to 357 million from 459 million pounds in 1995 while profit from its problem country debt portfolio, mainly in Latin America, jumped to 127 million from 50 million.\nLeonard and Panmure Gordon analyst David Poutney both said they would likely not be increasing their profit forcasts for 1997 which stand at 2.825 billion pounds and 2.94 billion respectively.\nBut Poutney, who has been advising clients to hold the shares but take profits, said he was now a seller.\n\"Overall, they are good figures but then it comes down to the valuation of the shares,\" Poutney said, \"and they are looking a bit expensive. I can't see them making much headway from here.\"\nLloyds said it made a restructuring provision of 75 million pounds following its purchase of insurer Lloyds Abbey Life and said it was raising its provision against possible redress from the mis-selling of pensions by 29 million pounds to 200 million, a move welcomed as prudent by analysts.\nPitman said Lloyds was comparing itself with the \"best U.S. companies\" such as Coca Cola and GE and like them has adopted the \"economic profit\" measure as the best guide to its performance as it reflects growth in investment and return.\nBroadly speaking, economic profit represents the difference between earnings on a company's equity and the equity cost.\nLloyds TSB said that, after excluding restructuring provisions, economic profit for 1996 was 69 percent higher at 1.055 million pounds compared with 623 million in 1995.\nPitman said the bank is likely to spend surplus capital on growth, both organic and by aquisition, or increasing dividends rather than on buying back shares like some of its competitors.\nPitman said shareholders had urged the bank not to buy back shares but to continue to provide them with high returns.\n\"Our capital ratios are greatly restored,\" Pitman said, \"and if we can, we would like to continue to grow (both) organically and by acquisition and increase dividends.\" ($1=.6128 Pound)\n", "Leading cruise ship operators looking to repeat their success at home by exporting some of American culture abroad will have to tailor their sea-going holidays to local markets and tastes.\nIndustry executives at an international trade convention said that Europe and Asia could be promising markets for Carnival Corp., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and others in the flourishing North American leisure cruise business, which barely existed three decades ago.\n\"The major North American lines are well positioned to grow internationally, as long as they acknowledge the major cultural and business differences,\" P&amp;O/Princess Cruises Chairman Tim Harris said during a panel discussion last week.\nNorth American cruises lines, offering trips to the Caribbean and along the West Coast of the United States to Alaska, are enjoying strong domestic business.\nBookings at Carnival Cruise Lines, the main unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp., are up 37 percent in the three months through last Monday while shipboard berths rose only 13 percent, Canrival Cruise Lines President Robert Dickinson said.\nStill another sign of the sector's health in the United States is that Walt Disney Co. will next year make its seawater debut by offering cartoon-themed cruises aboard two new ships from Port Canaveral in central Florida.\nThe industry is on a ship-building spree, with the just-launched Carnival Destiny capable of carrying 2,600 passengers while Royal Caribbean is building new ships that can carry 3,100 apiece.\nBut the customers are overwhelmingly from the United States and Canada and the offerings are unmistakably American -- whether aboard mass-marketer Carnival, which describes its increasingly gigantic vessels as fun ships, or other lines catering to richer tastes.\nThat is not all bad, the executives said, but more offerings tailored to national and regional tastes will likely be required in Asia and Europe.\n\"The right ships have to go to the right places with the right food,\" said Celebrity Cruises Inc. President Richard Sasso. Celebrity is an Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. affiliate.\nBoth Carnival, the industry leader with almost 27 percent of all cruise berths, and number two Royal Caribbean are already active overseas and employ different strategies.\nRoyal Caribbean competes in Europe but does little beyond hiring multilingual crews to adapt the onboard accomodations, food and entertainment from those it offers on seven-day trips from Miami, company chairman Richard Fain said.\n\"Our ships offer an American experience in Europe, not a European experience,\" Fain said. The European tours are aimed mostly at Americans.\n\"We are carrying more Europeans in the Caribbean than in Europe,\" Fain said.\nCarnival, which expects to carry more than 1 million passengers in 1997, is taking a multi-pronged approach by acquiring the Italian cruise operator Costa and buying into British tour group Airtours Plc.\nCarnival also has a joint venture with Hyundai Group of Korea to provide cruise holidays in Asia.\n\"Those three strategies were deployed to offer products in those markets for people in those markets,\" Dickinson said.\nHarris of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. affiliate P&amp;O/Princess Lines said business arrangements must also be fitted to foreign markets.\nKirk Lanterman, chairman of Carnival affiliate Holland America Line-Westour, said the overseas cruise markets were already substantial.\nHe said about 3 million people each year take cruises on small lines offering national or \"ethnic\" foods, entertainment and accommodations and about 500,000 non-Americans travelled on the lines operating from south Florida and elsewhere in North America.\nLanterman also warned his peers against diluting the character of their popular lines.\n\"It's very difficult to make these ships different for non-Americans without making it unsatisfactory for Americans,\" Lanterman said.\n", "Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison late Thursday confirmed he has formed an independent investor group to gauge interest in taking over troubled Apple Computer Inc.\nThe move, which is not the first time Ellison has raised the possibility of personally leading a bid for Apple, comes as the computer maker is struggling to recapture a profitable role in the intensely competitive PC industry.\nThe stock of Apple Computer Inc. rose in heavy trading Thursday, closing up $1.875 at $18.625 in Nasdaq trading after a newspaper reported that Ellison had renewed his interest in leading a takeover of Apple.\nEllison issued a statement late Thursday saying he and \"an undisclosed investor group\" had set up an e-mail address at savapple(at)us.oracle.com to test investor support for an acquisition of Apple.\n\"Presuming the successful acquisition of Apple by the Ellison investor group, what do you believe should be its single top priority?,\" was among the questions Ellison asked.\nEllison, a flamboyant software billionaire, has said for two years he would like to buy Apple with his own money, partly to prevent Microsoft Corp. from dominating the computer industry.\nHe restated his interest in acquiring control of the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker in an interview with the San Jose Mercury News, saying he would seek to raise $1 billion to buy a majority stake in Apple.\nAlthough Ellison said any bid would be independent of Oracle, the database company's stock fell $1.125 to $39.375. Apple and Oracle were among the market's most active issues.\nBased on its stock price, Apple is worth $2.17 billion. Ellison's stake in Oracle is worth about $6 billion.\nEllison said that based on the reaction from Apple investors, he will decide soon whether to make a bid in the next few days.\nPreviously, he has said he approached unidentified big investors about a joint bid. He also has mulled the idea with his friend Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who was kicked out of the company in 1985 and returned in December as a part-time adviser to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio.\nEllison could not be reached in person for comment. Katie Cotton, Apple spokeswoman, said the company had no comments about Ellison or his prospective bid.\nWall Street analysts said they doubted Ellison actually would attempt to buy Apple because he has not taken any concrete steps in the two years that he has expressed an interest.\n\"The deal doesn't make sense for (any outside investor) to take him up on it,\" said David Wu, analyst at investment bank ABN Ambro Chicago Corp.\nStill, Ellison's comments should not be dismissed, some analysts said.\n\"It would be a mistake to analyze this as a pure business issue, as there is substantial ego involved,\" said Paul Saffo, a tracker of Apple and Ellison and a research fellow at Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley think tank.\nEllison, the third-richest software tycoon behind Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen, is intent on slowing Microsoft's dominance of the software industry, he has said in recent interviews. Apple, with its huge following of Macintosh fans, could be a key weapon.\nSaffo also said Jobs, since returning to Apple late last year after it acquired his Next Software Inc., has been very influential in trimming the company, and could be \"sprucing up\" Apple for an acquisition.\nApple has suffered declining market share for its famous brand of easy-to-use computers and endured several rounds of restructuring in recent years. The stock has languished in the mid-teens since early January and is at a 10-year low.\n", "Britain's NatWest Bank revealed on Thursday its multi-million pound derivatives losses were nearly twice as large as first thought and that they began in 1994.\nA wide-ranging probe into the loss also led to drastic action, including suspension of four senior employees and the withdrawal of millions of pounds in staff bonuses.\nNatWest said the total loss was 90 million pounds ($144 million) but that five million had already been provisioned and eight million had been clawed back by not paying the bonuses, making a loss of 77 million pounds in the accounts. And Martin Owen, chief executive of the NatWest Markets investment banking division, will forego 200,000 of his 500,000 pounds 1996 bonus in a gesture to the industry.\n\"He has waived his bonus in recognition of his overall responsibility for the business. He believes he has made the gesture as an example to the industry,\" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters.\nOwen said it was unacceptable that the losses, which had resulted from options being wrongly priced systematically but stemmed from an initial interest rate options loss, had not been unearthed earlier. He said the problem came to light as a result of procedural changes to the way trading positions and valuations are checked. \"It has gone on (during) a long period; that is clearly unacceptable against the background of incidents in other firms as well. Fortunately, it does seem to be isolated to this area,\" Owen said. Although his role has come under scrutiny, NatWest's overall head Derek Wanless told Reuters he had complete confidence in Owen but the loss had been a setback for him in one area. The bank would learn lessons and emerge stronger, he added.\nThe staff suspensions, which have been notified to Britain's financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), followed the suspension of global head of options Neil Dodgson when the problem first came to light nearly two weeks ago.\nA former NatWest options trader, Kyriacos Papouis, has also been reported to the SFA, which confirmed it was examining the conduct of all six. NatWest said its requests to interview Papouis had so far been ignored.\nThe initial findings of NatWest's inquiry, carried out by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines, found no flaws in the models used to calculate valuations.\nOwen said details of how the mispricings went unnoticed for so long would be examined in the second phase of an internal inquiry.\nHe could not say if the initial options loss was the result of an individual's actions and could not comment on whether the subsequent mispricings had been intentional. \"I don't want to prejudge the second phase of the report because we are really deep into the examination of all the individuals associated with it. The degree to which there was collusion or not is something which is being examined,\" he said.\nBut further disciplinary action could follow from the report's second stage, he said.\nThose suspended were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets. NatWest stressed these suspensions were normal practice in such cases and did not imply guilt. Peter Hall, President and Chief Operating Officer of NatWest Markets, will temporarily take on the additional responsibilities of Chief Administrative Officer. Vincent Tomasi currently Senior Vice President and Head of US Debt Capital Markets at NatWest Markets in New York will take over as acting Head of Global Debt Derivatives. The bank said that a new management structure it had intended to put into place following its 1996 acquisition of U.S. bond trading house Greenwich Capital and the creation of a global debt markets division would now be accelerated. NatWest is continuing to keep bank regulator the Bank of England closely informed, and the second phase of the inquiry would take place as quickly as possible, concentrating on the role of individuals, Owen said.

Some analysts believe the FARC wants to use the release to show it is a genuine guerrilla army, not terrorists and drug traffickers as charged by Colombia's government and military.\nBut the government is keen to treat its fight against left-wing guerrillas as a largely domestic affair and it has insisted there is nothing to negotiate when it comes to the prisoners' release.\n\"We want to set up a commission that carries real weight so that the government is forced to create the right conditions for the handover,\" Leon Calarca said. \"We want both an international and national presence.\"\nOnce the commission is formed it will negotiate the timetable for the soldiers' release and witness the handover.\nThe troops were seized in an attack on a jungle camp in Las Delicias in which 27 soldiers were killed. It marked the start of one of the bloodiest guerrilla offensives in decades.\nThe government has nominated three people to the panel, Bishop of Bogota Monsignor Pedro Rubiano, former Foreign Minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo and ex-Sen.

We're off and doing other things. As far as we're concerned, it's past history,\" Senior Vice President David Brownell told Reuters in a telephone interview.  \nHowever, Brownell said Tyco would still welcome friendly talks with American Standard.\n\"If the American Standard management would like to speak with us, we would be happy to speak with them,\" he said.\nBrownell said that Tyco has not tried to contact American Standard since its December offer was rejected.\nAmerican Standard earlier disclosed that it had received the offer from Tyco but had determined that it wanted to remain independent. It also said it did not plan to hold any discussions with Tyco.\nTyco had offered $50 per share, or about $3.9 billion, for American Standard in a combination of stock and cash.\nShares of American Standard, which had rallied more than 4 in early trade, were up 3-1/4 to 43-1/2 by midafternoon.\nTyco shares were unchanged at 54-5/8.\n", "Confusion mounted on Monday when British electricity company Northern Electric's fight against a hostile takeover from the U.S. prompted the Takeover Panel watchdog to launch an inquiry into the bid.\nJust one day before a new bid deadline, the Takeover Panel said it was investigating the circumstances in which it had received information from Northern's advisers during the 782 million pound ($1.3 billion) bid by America's CE Electric.\n\"Following the investigation, the executive will consider what, if any, further action is appropriate,\" it stated.\nThe role of Northern's adviser, investment bank BZW, has been under scrutiny since it failed to disclose until last Friday a 250,000 pound payment from Northern for its services in addition to its 1.5 million pound fixed fee.\nBZW has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman told Reuters: \"We have absolutely nothing to hide from an investigation and we expect to be fully exonerated.\"\nBut asked whether the investigation may last into the New Year, the spokesman added: \"I would think so, yes.\"\nThe Panel noted that it may also look into the acquisition by BZW and investment bank Schroders of 2.32 percent of Northern Electric's shares last week.\nAlthough U.S. energy group CE Electric complained about the share purchases, the Panel cleared the deals last week. Advisers are allowed to buy shares under British takeover rules despite the move being aimed at defeating takeover bids.\nNewcastle-based Northern Electric's independence has been on a knife-edge since last Friday, when the bid timetable ticked to a close and CE Electric, which is controlled by energy utility CalElergy, fell fractionally short of winning control.\nBut in an unusual twist, the Takeover Panel decided to extend the bid until 1300 GMT Tuesday for unspecified reasons.\nGallingly for Northern Electric, CE Electric had by Monday boosted shareholder acceptances for its bid to just over the 50 percent mark needed for victory from 49.77 percent on Friday.\nConsequently, Northern Electric launched an appeal on Monday into the decision to extend the bid deadline and requested that its shares be temporarily suspended.\nImmediate details were unavailable about whether the Takeover Panel's decision to investigate the bid indicated that it was willing to reconsider its decision to extend the offer -- or may allow late bid acceptances.\n\"We are not able to clarify anything at the moment,\" a spokeswoman said, adding that comments would be available \"in due course.\"\nCE Electric officials declined to comment. Northern, which says institutional investors including the Prudential, Foreign &amp; Colonial and M&amp;G support the board, said it was awaiting the Panel ruling more \"in ignorance\" rather than \"in confusion.\"\n\"We are in uncharted territory,\" a spokesman told Reuters, adding that it remained unclear whether the Panel had decided to allow Northern's appeal or not.\nMeanwhile, Northern's shares have stopped trading at 638 pence, 12 pence short of the 650-pence-per-share that CE Electric is offering for control of the electricity company.\nIt is the second time that Northern's fate hangs in the balance since it was privatised along with its 11 regional electricity company (REC) peers in 1990.\nIt was the first of the cash-rich RECs to face a takeover in 1994 and became the only one to successfully fight off, partly with the help of an extraordinary 560 million pound defence package, a bid by conglomerate Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner.\nThree U.S. utilities, attracted by Britain's regulatory regime that curbs prices rather than profits, have already snapped up RECs. Two other bids have yet to be completed.\nIf CE Electric wins control of Northern, only two of the 12 original RECs will remain independent -- Yorkshire Electricity Group and Southern Electric.

The FCC \"is going to be setting a new precedent,\" a government official said.\nGovernment and industry officials said the FCC is considering restructuring the payments that last year's auction winners must make to the government. The agency is expected soon to put out different proposals for public comment.\nThe bids have become loans from the government, with the winners paying interest on the money that's due for licenses to offer \"personal communications services,\" or PCS.\nThe companies paid what were considered high prices. Many have since found it tough to raise financing.\nThe options under study at the FCC include:\n-- Handling each company in a case-by-case manner. That way, payments could be restructured on an individual basis.\n-- Deferring payments for a number of years -- say five, for example -- after which companies would make their interest payments and then pay off the remaining principal amount due. The breathing space would give companies time to build their PCS networks and make some money.\n-- Letting winners pay, up front, a discounted lump sum based on interest payments otherwise due in the future.\nThe FCC also has been negotiating with the Treasury Department for help and advice. The FCC is \"not particularly expert in this area and never expected to be in it,\" the government official said.\nIn addition, several winners -- including top bidder NextWave Telecom Inc. -- have asked the FCC for permission to make interest payments yearly, instead of quarterly.\nLast month, the FCC suspended the quarterly payments while it mulled the request -- a move that, according to one estimate, is costing the government $1.5 million daily.\nGovernment and industry officials said the FCC is in a tough spot, especially because Congress is depending on the auction revenues to help balance the government's books.\nIf companies were to default on their payments and the FCC were to reauction the licenses, the new prices probably would be far less than the original amounts bid, analysts agreed.\nMany of the auction winners \"will soon face financial crises if the FCC does not act swiftly and decisively to change the license payment terms,\" MCI Communications Corp. told the FCC earlier this month.\nThe No. 2 long-distance company -- which has signed a deal with NextWave to lease the company's PCS network to provide wireless services to it own customers -- wants the FCC to handle the companies' problems on a case-by-case basis.\nBut others urge the FCC to reject that approach. They want the agency to develop a general rule -- through its usual rulemaking process -- that would apply to all companies.\n\"We are concerned that whatever the FCC does, it does it fairly and equally across the board,\" attorney Mark Tauber of Piper &amp; Marbury said. \"It's bad 'PR' for the commission if they give the idea that special deals are available.\"\nAirGate Wireless, which won four PCS licenses at an auction that ended early this year, wants the FCC to take more aggressive action: reinstate the quarterly interest payments; declare companies in default companies that fail to make payments; and reauction the licenses of those in default.\n\"Anything less sends a message to existing licensees and future auction bidders that the FCC will provide a financial safety net for bidders that bid beyond their financial capabilities,\" the Washington-based firm told the FCC.\nMeanwhile, the companies are expected to get some help from a recent global trade agreement that will make it easier for foreign communications companies to invest in U.S. carriers. The FCC is developing a proposal to implement the agreement, which could pave the way for foreign sources of money.\n", "CVS Corp on Friday said it expected its proposed $2.8 billion acquisition of Revco D.S.

And that's what I think this combination will do,\" Chief Operating Officer Thomas Ryan told Reuters in a telephone interview.  \nRyan said that CVS had also considered an acquisition of Eckerd Corp but the transaction with Revco was determined to be a better fit. J.C. Penney Co Inc announced a $3.3 billion acquisition of Eckerd in November.\nHe said CVS and Revco had held talks since early October, adding that key criteria for strategic acquisitions pursued by CVS included leadership in new markets, growth potential in pharmacy operations and earnings accretion.\n\"We think combining these two entities across the largest retail store base in the country positions us pretty well for the managed-care environment going forward,\" Ryan said.  \n\"This will make us a stronger company on the retail side, and it also will strengthen us as a health-care player,\" he said, referring to CVS' patient benefit management company and Revco's mail-order operations.\nThe planned acquisition of Revco is expected to result in about 1,000 layoffs at the company's Twinsburg, Ohio, headquaters. CVS and Revco did not specifically cite those figures but did not dispute the estimates.\n\"It's unfortunate, but I like to think about the 98 percent of the people that we are employing at Revco,\" he said, adding that CVS would honor Revco severance packages.\nRyan said CVS might consider other acquisitions, although most of its attention was likely to be focused on Revco in the near term.\n\"We're always looking for the right opportunity, but obviously our focus is on maintaining the productivity and the customer service we've established at CVS and to begin to work on the transition at Revco,\" he said.\n", "Tyco International Ltd. said Monday that it had made a $4 billion bid for American Standard Companies Inc. but would not pursue a merger after the maker of plumbing supplies and air conditioners rejected its offer.\n\"Tyco historically has not done hostile takeovers and we are not going to do a hostile takeover here,\" Senior Vice President David Brownell said in a telephone interview.\nBrownell added that Tyco, a diversified manufacturing company, had not had any further contact with American Standard since its offer was rejected in early December, a day after it was made.\n\"We're off and doing other things. As far as we're concerned, it's past history,\" Brownell said.\nIn a letter dated Dec. 5, Tyco offered $50 a share, or about $4 billion, to acquire American Standard, which became a public company in February 1995.\nTyco said that under its proposal American Standard shareholders would have received $50 a share either in Tyco stock or cash, or a combination of both.\nAmerican Standard, however, rejected the offer almost immediately, believing it was in the best interest of its shareholders for it to remain independent.\n\"American Standard's board of directors reviewed the proposal and concluded that strategies already in place are working and the best way to increase earnings and shareholder value is to stay focused on carrying out the strategies as an independent company,\" the company said in a statement Monday.\n\"Accordingly, the company declined any interest in that proposal, has not had any discussions with Tyco concerning it and no discussions are contemplated.\"\nAmerican Standard noted in its statement that its stock price had doubled since it went public in 1995 and it planned to proceed with an announced secondary public offering and repurchase of shares next month.\nAmerican Standard, based in Piscataway, N.J., is the parent of companies that produce Trane and American Standard air conditioning products, American Standard, Ideal Standard, and Standard plumbing products and WABCO commercial and utility vehicle brake and control systems.\nTyco, based in Exeter, N.H., had said in its proposal that a combination of the companies would benefit both and produce annual cost savings of at least $150 million to $200 million.\nBrownell also said Tyco would still welcome friendly talks with American Standard.\n\"If the American Standard management would like to speak with us, we would be happy to speak with them,\" he said.\nAmerican Standard, however, insisted Monday that it was determined to remain independent.\nTyco's offer of $50 a share would have meant paying a steep premium for American Standard, whose shares closed Friday at $40.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBoth company's shares were suspended from trading early Monday on the New York Stock Exchange after the Wall Street Journal reported Tyco's offer in its Monday issue.\nIn afternoon trading, American Standard was up $2.375 to $42.625, while Tyco rose 12.5 cents to $54.75.\n", "BellSouth Corp on Thursday produced another set of strong earnings, with fourth quarter figures one cent above consensus, and extremely strong access line growth and cellular customer expansion.\nAnalysts note BellSouth has done this on a lean cost base, aided by a conservative approach to expensive projects like Personal Communications Services (PCS), and futuristic broadband networks.\n\"They did report a penny better than expectations,\" said Lind Meltzer, an analyst at UBS Securities.\nThe company boosted earnings per share before one-off items by 12.3 percent to $0.64, from $0.57 a year ago. The First Call consensus was $0.63.\n\"I think their double digit earnings growth is sustainable,\" said Barry Sine, an analyst at SBC Warburg, though he was less confident that growth would continue at 12-13 percent as had been seen.\nTotal operating revenues rose six percent to $5.05 billion from $4.76 billion in the fourth quarter and operating expenses rose 5.7 percent, excluding year ago charges.\nPreparing for entry into long distance and to defend the local calling market from new rivals is a challenge to costs, but BellSouth is so far doing well.\n\"Just holding the line on margins is an achievement, and they managed to expand a little,\" said Sine.\nBellSouth only bid for PCS licenses to fill in gaps of its regional cellular coverage while some other Bells banded together to build a national network.\nAnalysts also applaud its 'wait and see' approach to the information superhighway, which has been more broadly adopted by phone companies after technological and marketing setbacks.\n\"They have been proved right,\" Sine said.\nAccess line growth over BellSouth's huge and economically buoyant region was 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. This was below the third quarter's 4.9 percent and the 5.0 of the second quarter.\n\"We're not sure how much of this decline is secular, and how much is related to the (second quarter strength) from the Atlanta Olympics,\" Sine said.\n\"Volume growth at BellSouth did look a little weak considering they are normally at the high end of the regional Bells,\" Meltzer said.\nSBC Communications Inc and Ameritech Corp each recently reported some moderation in line growth.\nIn Ameritech's case this is a deliberate cut back in marketing because second lines have a long payback period, particularly when used for linking computers to the Internet which does not generate access revenues, analysts have said.\nBellSouth telephone operations cash expenses rose 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago.\n\"They have got some room to go on costs as they came to cost-cutting a little later than some,\" Sine said.\nBellSouth its employees per 10,000 access lines had fallen to 28.2 from 32.5 a year ago, a measure of productivity improvements.\nThe stock closed 1-1/2 lower at 42-3/8 as the broad market fell.

They (Pioneer) did not move as quickly and as early on biotechnology,\" Piper Jaffray analyst George Dahlman said. \"They have done an amazing job of catching up.\"\nIn addition to Bt corn, Pioneer's other transgenic products include soybeans that can withstand the use of Monsanto Co's Roundup herbicide. Pioneer also will have limited quantities of corn that can resist Liberty herbicide, which is produced by AgrEvo, a venture between Hoechst AG and Schering AG.  \nPioneer is developing corn that can resist Roundup, but it may be 1998 or 1999 until it is introduced, McConnell said.\nFor this year, McConnell declined to project Pioneer's North American corn market share, which in fiscal 1996 dropped to 44 percent from 45 percent. DeKalb Genetics Corp, the number two player, has an 11 percent market share in corn.\nHe linked the market share loss in 1996 in part to the fallout from disease and insect problems that hurt two Pioneer hybrids in 1995. Those problems are being addressed with new corn hybrids.  \nPiper Jaffray's Dahlman said he expects Pioneer's market share will be about flat in fiscal 1997 ending in August compared with 1996.\nTo bolster its future product lineup, Pioneer would consider collaborating with other players, including some outside the agricultural industry, McConnell said. \"There will be other biotech boutiques that we will want to work with,\" he added.\nPioneer currently collaborates with Mycogen Inc, an agricultural biotech company, and Human Genome Sciences Inc, which is involved in a DNA project with Pioneer.\nWhile Pioneer targets 20 percent return on equity and double-digit percentage growth in earnings per share, it will not shy away from investing in technology, McConnell said.\n\"We're not looking to shoot ourselves in the foot with short-term issues just to achieve those goals,\" McConnell said. \"We'll make the appropriate investments.\"\n\t ((Reuters Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))\n", "China's move at the weekend to make the yuan convertible under the current account is cause for celebration among traders and businessmen, but Beijing's goal of full convertibility is still far off, analysts said on Monday.\nNews that the yuan had been made convertible under the current account from Sunday was little more than the final seal on a long process of currency liberalisation, but would be welcomed by traders and investors alike, they said.\n\"This announcement is more symbolic than substantial... because foreign and domestic investors have had easy access to swap centres and foreign exchange banks,\" said one investment analyst in Shanghai who declined to be identified.\nThe formalisation of increased convertibility was welcome and was also a vital step in China's long-delayed application for entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), said Adam Williams, chief representative of Jardine Fleming in Beijing.\n\"It's cause to celebrate,\" Williams said. \"This is not full convertibility, but it's a fair step towards it... It's good for everybody.\"\nState media has quoted central bank governor Dai Xianglong as saying December 1 marked formal Chinese compliance on current account convertibility under the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Article VIII.\nArticle VIII is an undertaking to refrain from imposing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, or from engaging in discriminatory currency arrangements.\nCurrent account convertibility covers payment for trade in merchandise and services such as shipping, banking and tourism, as well as private transfers -- although analysts said currency conversion by ordinary Chinese remained restricted.\nThe analysts said China had long since dismantled the main barriers to IMF recognition of current account convertibility, leaving only technical issues to be resolved in recent weeks.\nBeijing's move mainly signalled its confidence in the yuan's stability -- with foreign reserves at more than $100 billion -- and in the new-found efficacy of its macro-economic controls, said a Chinese analyst at a foreign bank in Beijing.\nThe official Xinhua news agency has quoted government experts as predicting stability for the yuan, arguing that the decision to boost convertibility reflected the smooth running of China's new currency exchange system since January 1994.\nWhile China had come a long way in loosening controls on its currency, the final goal of full convertibility was still a distant one, the analysts said.\nCentral bank governor Dai told Reuters in a recent interview that China still needed a \"fairly long period\" before making the yuan convertible under the capital account and there was no timetable for doing so.\n\"The next step is convertibility on the capital account, which I would say is a fair way down the road yet,\" said one Beijing-based foreign analyst.\nBeijing was concerned that large flows of funds could upset financial and stock markets and wanted to avoid a Mexican-style currency crisis, said a Western banker in Shanghai.\n\"Many capitalist countries in Asia, like Taiwan and South Korea, have foreign exchange controls so it is understandable for China to keep stringent foreign exchange controls,\" he said.\n", "Four days of savage combat around this mountain town some 30 miles (50 km) east of Bogota has exposed what military experts say is the fatal flaw in the Colombian army's new counterinsurgency strategy -- the belief that helicopters can win the war.\nThe battle raging against knife-edged precipices and deep gorges between leftist rebels and the army has shown the strategy for what it is, the experts said.\n\"There have been many examples where more material hasn't won the war. More helicopters are just not the solution. You simply can't fly a chopper into the combat zone and drop troops,\" a Western defence attache told Reuters.\nThe Colombian military is scheduled to take delivery of several U.S.-made Blackhawks and Russian-produced Mi-17 helicopters this year. But the defence attache said, \"I personally wouldn't touch the Russian helicopters.

So far, at least 19 soldiers are reported dead and dozens listed as wounded or missing. Details about rebel casualties have been sketchy.\nAttempts to fly in reinforcements over the weekend were thwarted as Blackhawk helicopters came under repeated fire from Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas. At least three helicopters were knocked temporarily out of commission, giving rebels time to take up strategic positions.\nJust three weeks ago, in the face of a wave of guerrilla attacks across the country, armed forces chief Gen. Harold Bedoya announced a counterinsurgency emergency plan in which a sophisticated helicopter fleet was to play a key role and allow for surgical strikes against the rebels.\nBut experts say the strikes are being made with little more than a dull knife if the fighting around San Juanito is any example. It is one of the longest battles in recent memory and one of the worst to have erupted so close to Bogota.\nThe last humiliating blow dealt by the FARC was when they overran a jungle base in southern Colombia on Aug. 30, killing 27 soldiers and taking at least 60 prisoner. That defeat led military experts to suggest the army had lost control of Colombia's long-running guerrilla war and was setting itself up for seemingly irrevocable defeat.\nIn the battle that began on Friday, Defence Minister Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez stressed that the army had stepped intentionally into the lion's den with its helicopters. \"This whole thing started as an army offensive. It wasn't an ambush, the army went in there,\" Gonzalez said.\nAccording to reports so far, the army has definitely come come off as second best.\n", "With just 100 days before China regains its coveted prize of Hong Kong, Beijing has sidestepped the colony's departing British masters and made sure new local leaders know where to take their cue.\nChina has made clear its intention to mould the territory's politics more in its own image, mapping plans to dismantle the elected legislature and water down civil liberties laws while telling Britain that objections were pointless.\n\"China is firmly in charge,\" said a Beijing-based diplomat.\nChinese Premier Li Peng has brushed aside London's hopes of monitoring the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong after the handover, proclaiming that Beijing would implement the accord as it saw fit.\n\"I think this is unrealistic,\" Li said when asked about British plans to review the pact's implementation after the transfer of power. \"After July 1, Hong Kong's sovereignty returns to China.\"\nUnder the 1984 accord, China has pledged to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover.\nBeijing has also ensured that the future administrators of the territory are firmly in its camp.\nSince his selection by a group of 400 people vetted by Beijing, Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting Tung Chee-hwa has shown little enthusiasm for staking out positions differing from China's official party line.\nBEIJING LIKES WHAT IT HEARS\nThe shipping tycoon-turned-politician, who has shuttled between Hong Kong and Beijing since he was named chief executive-designate last December, has echoed China's views on issues ranging from the territory's future legislature to civil liberties and textbook revisions.\nHe has also hurled barbs at Hong Kong democratic activists who have been critical of China.\nBeijing has responded by showing its pleasure.\nThe official media have described Tung in a somewhat more flattering fashion than that reserved for the territory's current and last colonial governor, Chris Patten, who has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over his efforts to expand democratic institutions in the final years of British rule.\nIn a sign of official favour, cameras of China's national television lingered on Tung when he attended funeral rites last month for late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the man credited with directing the strategy that enabled Beijing to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong.\n\"Mr Tung knows that if he doesn't carry out Beijing's wishes, someone else will,\" said a Western diplomat in Beijing.\nOther analysts in Beijing are willing to wait before making a judgment on Tung.\n\"He has to establish his credibility with the Chinese,\" said a foreign diplomat in Beijing who follows Hong Kong affairs.\nWILL TUNG STAND UP FOR HONG KONG?\n\"The question is, will he stand up for Hong Kong's interests in the future?\"\nSome people are not so sure.\n\"That is the charitable assessment,\" said one foreign diplomat in Hong Kong.\nHe and other analysts suggest that Tung may be more like many of Hong Kong's business leaders who are often reluctant to confront Beijing in public, whatever the issue.\nThe analysts note opposition can be costly.\nJardine Matheson, one of the colony's oldest trading houses, was publicly vilified by Beijing after its directors supported political reforms proposed by Patten. It has since worked hard to mend its relationship.\nBusinessman Jimmy Lai printed vitriolic comments about China's premier in his Next magazine in 1994. Lai's Giordano clothing outlets ran into problems with authorities in China and he eventually sold his share in the firm.\nMany businessmen would probably prefer to see their names linked to more soothing comments to Beijing's ears, such as those of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, on the contribution of China's late leader Deng Xiaoping.\nAn article by Li that was published prominently in the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, praised the late party patriarch, his chosen successor and the future system for Hong Kong, all making deft use of communist jargon.\nBut diplomats said that for political leaders such as Tung, there is a considerable risk in being perceived as too willing to speak out on behalf of Beijing.\nChina wants a popular leader who can rally the territory's 6.4 million people to Beijing's cause, they said.\nIf its interests clash with those of Hong Kong, and Tung is perceived merely as Beijing's willing tool, the future leader risks losing his still high popular support.\n\"China chose him because he was acceptable to many people and would do its bidding,\" said a diplomat. \"If he loses popularity in Hong Kong, that complicates matters for Beijing.\"\n", "Japan's Finance Ministry served notice on Friday that it may take punitive action against Nomura Securities Co Ltd over suspected illegal deals involving a corporate client.\nFinance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference on Friday that the ministry would take strict measures, if necessary, after Japan's securities watchdog -- the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) -- completes its investigation into the dubious deals.\nMitsuzuka said that it would be \"very regrettable\" if Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage, was involved in illegal trading as reported.\nOn Thursday, Nomura publicly admitted that it was highly likely that two of its directors had been involved in illegal deals.\nAt a hastily called news conference, Nomura vice president Atsushi Saito said that Nomura had found out that the directors made deals regarded as discretionary transactions with a corporate client, and they also transfered profits from Nomura's own account to the client's account.\nHe said that both of the actions are illegal, and the SESC has been investigating the case.\nThe revelations are yet another blot on the reputation of Japanese business, already hurt by scandals over unauthorised markets trading, shady oil deals and cosy contacts between bureaucrats, politicians and corporate executives.\nAfter the securities industry was hit by a scandal over compensating favoured clients for losses in the early 1990s, Japan banned brokers from making discretionary transaction contracts with clients as these give brokers free rein to make investment decisions.  \nBrokerage industry officials said any punishment would not be imminent and could possibly take the form of a suspension of Nomura business.\nYasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities, said: \"Investigations take a long time to complete in the first place and as the market is at a crucial stage ahead of the end-March book closing, punishment measures will probably not be announced or carried out in a hurry.\"\nA market source said that in the past, illegal activity by brokers has resulted in a partial business suspension as the functions of the trading section of the brokerage cannot be halted completely.\nHowever, there is a possibility that a more severe penalty, such as a suspension of buying and selling on Nomura's own account, could be imposed if the authorities conclude that illegal actions did take place, he said.\nNomura shares fell in the wake of the news conference, finishing 50 yen lower at 1,530 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after being ask-only at the opening. But many analysts and market sources said that Nomura's business was unlikely to be greatly undermined by the news and that the stock price should prove resilient.\nThey also said that that the market had to some extent digested the scandal as the media reported on the suspected impropriety last year.\n\"I've told our boys it's great buy opportunity,\" said one foreign analyst.\nAnother securities analyst, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson International's Robert Garone, said: \"This is not devastating for Nomura or the brokerage industry.\"\nAyako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd, said, however: \"I reviewed the rating for Nomura after yesterday's news and reduced it to neutral from buy.\"\nShe said that the topside of Nomura's shares would be heavy for a while until the stock market fully digests any punishment imposed on Nomura by regulators and its impact, if any, on Nomura's business.\nBut she said it was unlikely Nomura would lose its top ranking among Japanese brokerages. \"I don't think Nomura will fall from the current top position even in the long term,\" she said.\nBut any change in top management at the brokerage may hamper Nomura's ability to take swift, proactive steps to deal with Japan's \"Big Bang\" financial reforms, she added.\n", "The consortium building the Sydney 2000 Olympic stadium on Thursday closed the books on an innovative funding scheme that turned into one of Australia's biggest market flops.\nStadium Australia had hoped to offset some of its A$660 million (US$515 million) construction costs through the sale of 34,400 \"Gold Passes\" giving investors a mixture of Olympic tickets, equity and stadium membership.\nBut investors and sports fans alike shunned the A$364.4 million (US$286.05 million) offer, leaving underwriters facing a massive funding shortfall.\nAnalysts and local media put the gap at up to A$240 million, which would make it one of Australia's biggest share flops and mean big losses for the four firms that underwrote the issue.\nA spokeswoman for Stadium Australia said it expected to release the results of the float late next week, even though the issue officially closed on Thursday afternoon.\nSydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) president Michael Knight, who is also Olympics minister in the New South Wales government, agreed on Thursday that the Stadium Australia float likely fell short.\n\"It is not a direct concern to either the government or to SOCOG, although obviously we would prefer that the stadium float was better subscribed than is apparently the case,\" Knight told reporters.\nThe disappointment comes hard on the heels of the unexpected departure of SOCOG chief executive Mal Hemmerling, although the issue was unrelated. Hemmerling was replaced by Sandy Hollway, who worked for former prime minister Bob Hawke.\nIt also follows financial difficulties experienced by the Australian Olympic Committee, which has lost millions of dollars investing in a Queensland casino.\nThe Stadium Australia offer has been open for almost six months, more than twice as long as most share offers.\nIts offer of 34,400 gold packages at A$10,000 each and 600 platinum passes at A$33,000 each opened on October 7, and its closing date has been extended twice due to lack of demand.\nThe gold packages include a seat at every stadium session of the 2000 Olympic Games, stadium membership for 30 years and 1,000 shares in the stadium company itself. The platinum package includes two priority seats and membership privileges.\nAustralian stockbrokers said the offer was too expensive given that average income in Australia was only A$36,000.\n\"Nobody is going to buy just one ticket, with a family you are more likely to buy four, so it's going to cost A$40,000,\" said one Sydney-based broker.\n\"Not many people can spend that sort of money, particularly if there is no guarantee on what events are going to be held there after the Olympics,\" the broker said.\nThe four underwriters of the stadium offer are ANZ Securities, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Macquarie Bank Ltd and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.\n\"If there is a shortfall, (and) that appears to be the case, after today they will still have a considerable period of time to trade their way out of trouble,\" Knight said of the four.\nThe underwriters must fund the project regardless of whether all the packages are sold, thus guaranteeing the completion of the 110,000-seat stadium, which is due to open in 1999 in time for a season of pre-Olympic competitions.\n\"The money is absolutely guaranteed, the stadium construction is rocketing ahead and will not be affected in any way by the difficulties the underwriters are facing in recouping the money,\" Knight said.\nThe stadium is being built by a consortium led by private Australian construction group Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd, British investment bank Hambros Plc and Japanese building contractor Obayashi Corp.\n(A$=US$.7850)\n", "China has assembled a virtual \"who's who\" of its Communist leaders to arrange Deng Xiaoping's funeral next week in what analysts described as a show of unity for his chosen successor.\nDiplomats in the capital also said the 459-member group would draw a veil over the Communist Party's internal politics ahead of a key party congress where decisions on top jobs and future policies would be made later this year.\n\"This is obviously too big a group to make funeral arrangements,\" said a Western diplomat on Friday. \"Not everyone will be making decisions.\"\nDeng died on Wednesday aged 92. China will hold the funeral for its paramount leader next Tuesday in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing.\nThe ceremonies -- unlike those for revolutionary leader Mao Zedong in 1976 -- will not include a lying in state with a mourning public allowed to file past.\nIn accordance with his wishes, Deng's body parts will be donated to science and his ashes will be scattered at sea.\nDeng's anointed successor, Commmunist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin, is chairman of the funeral committee that includes all members of the 18-man Politburo and veterans of the communist revolution such as former president Yang Shangkun, 89, and ex-parliament chairman Peng Zhen, 95.\nThe list also includes Hua Guofeng, Mao's chosen successor until he was toppled by Deng.\n\"It is meant to be a sign of great unity and stability,\" said another foreign envoy.\nDiplomats said the inclusion of the elder statesmen in the group aimed to lend legitimacy to the current leadership, providing a link to the party's revolutionary roots.\n\"This gives them some continuity with the first generation of the leadership,\" said a European diplomat.\nBut it also helps conceal the inner workings of the party as key figures jockey for position before the 15th party congress.\nBroad decisions on political and economic strategy are likely to be taken at the meeting, held every five years.\nPolitical analysts said the creation of a smaller group to direct the funeral arrangements might give too much information to the public which is normally kept at a safe distance from the party's internal workings.\nThe tighter the group, the easier to identify the main players, they said.\n\"They (party leaders) don't want to reveal too much before the congress,\" said the European diplomat.\n", "Apple Computer Inc., undertaking a second restructuring in a year, could announce on Friday bigger-than expected job cuts and forecast a big loss for the second quarter, analysts said.\nThe Cupertino, Calif., personal computer maker also is expected to specify which product lines it plans to drop as it concentrates on businesses that are still relatively healthy.  \nSince Apple announced in January that it expects to report quarterly losses until at least September 1997, trade magazines and newspaper reports have speculated that the company would have to fire between 2,000 and 5,000 of its 13,000 employees to adjust its costs to declining revenues.\n\"I would not be surprised if the layoffs were deeper than the original estimates,\" said James Poyner, an analyst at investment bank Oppenheimer &amp; Co in New York.\nApple executives have said they expect revenue for this fiscal year ending September to decline about 20 percent to about $8 billion.  \nThe company has said it would have to cut at least $400 million in costs this year to break even.\nApple may have to cut costs even deeper because Macintosh sales are declining faster than expected, analysts said.  In the March quarter, worldwide shipments of Macintosh computers will fall to about 804,000 units compared with 884,000 units in the March quarter of 1996, said Matt Sargent, analyst at market research firm Computer Intelligence InfoCorp.\nApple also will tell investors which product lines it will cut.  \nAnalysts have speculated that Newton handheld computers could be discontinued or sold to another computer company.\nLast week, Chairman Gilbert Amelio told employees in an internal letter that the company would specify the cuts this Friday.\n\"I would like to hear clear bullet points on what they are going to do and what they are not going to do,\" said Stephen Dube, analyst at Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York. \"Every time Amelio has spoken he has sent confusing messages.\"\nDube said he expects Apple also to forecast on Friday the size of its loss from operations for the quarter ending March.\nWall Street expects Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., to post a loss from operations of $0.79 a share, according to a recent survey by First Call.\n", "Fierce fighting for control of this mountain community outside the capital shows that Colombia's military appears to be losing the battle against Latin America's oldest guerrilla army, according to political analysts.\nAs four-days of fighting, in which 16 soldiers died, came to an end, army commander Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett flew in by helicopter on Wednesday to tell townspeople that Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas had been driven out of the area and that the soldiers were the peasants' allies.\nBut given the military's record of human rights abuses and counterinsurgency tactics, few peasants believed his pledge that the army would not take reprisals against civilians. Most said that once the military pulled out, FARC would be back.\nFARC was set up as a pro-Soviet guerrilla group in 1964. It seeks a Marxist revolution for greater social justice and land distribution and opposes what it sees as U.S. interference in Colombian affairs.\nSan Juanito, 6,000 feet (1,800 m) above sea-level, amid knife-edge precipes and cavernous gorges, 30 miles (50 km) east of Bogota, is a microcosm of the large areas Colombia that political analysts say are under the de facto political and economic control of the guerrillas.\n\"We're neither for nor against the guerrillas. But we have to learn to live with those around us,\" said San Juanito mayor Ramiro Jimenez, referring to a strong rebel presence around the town for the past four years.\n\"The army has complained of lack of support from the people but we're a long way from the provincial government and there's no permanent military post here. What are we supposed to do?\" he added.\nEven as Bonett gave a speech in the town square, a guerrilla source pointed out some of the FARC rebels who had taken part in the recent fighting mingling among the crowd.\nSince 1993, when the FARC set up its 53rd Front in the area, as many as 50 rebels at a time have held regular, public meetings with San Juanito's inhabitants -- the last was just four weeks ago.\n\"The rebels hold frequent meetings and say they do not want anything (from the townspeople) and pay for the food they need. But they have made it clear that they will not tolerate informants,\" said the guerrilla source.\nBonett believed as many as 400 FARC rebels are based in the area because of San Juanito's location along part of a \"strategic corridor\" linking the eastern plains to Bogota.\nHundreds of troops have transformed San Juanito into a garrison town since fighting broke out last Saturday. But many local shopkeepers view the soldiers with distrust. Some even refuse to serve them and there is a feeling that the newly arrived force is an army of occupation not liberation.\n\"Guerrillas used to pass by my house and ask for food and drink. It makes me frightened to think that the army could start to take reprisals against those of us who have fed the rebels,\" said Ligia Gutierrez, of the nearby community of El Tablon, scene of the heaviest fighting.\n\"If I go to my fields on foot the army accuses me of being a subversive. If I go on a mule then they accuse me of running errands for the guerrilla,\" said another peasant.\nAnother woman complained directly to Bonett that an army officer had ordered more than $2,000 merchandise, destined for her small shop, to be confiscated on the grounds it was supplies for the guerrilla.\nOne soldier, on guard duty near the town's small airstrip, summed up the problem for the army. \"We come here and don't know the lie of the land. The locals won't guide us along the paths used by the guerrillas for fear of being seen as collaborators. We might as well be blindfolded,\" he said.\n", "General Motors Corp. said on Thursday it expected an $870 million reduction in its fourth quarter earnings due to recent strikes in the United States and Canada and costs associated with its new United Auto Workers contract\nIn its quarterly 10-Q report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C., the auto giant also said its Delco Electronics unit faced a substantial decline in future profit margins from price cuts and the loss of GM-related business.\nGM said the costs associated with the U.S. and Canadian strikes came to $700 million, or 91 cents a share. The Canadian Auto Workers was on strike for three weeks in October over contract negotiations with the automaker, causing factory shutdowns in the United States.\nGM was still reeling from the Canadian walkout when UAW members staged local strikes at a metal stamping plant in Indianapolis and a truck plant in Janesville, Wis., which forced GM to idle more workers.\nProduction was cut back at 17 North American assembly plants and numerous parts facilities. GM said earlier this week the strikes cost it at least 151,000 vehicles in the walkouts, cutting its planned fourth quarter production to 1.169 million cars and trucks\nGM said lump-sum payments to U.S. workers under its new UAW contract will force it to book a charge of $170 million, or 22 cents a share, against fourth quarter earnings.\nUnder the pact, GM will pay each of its 215,000 UAW workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by three percent increases in base wages during the second and third years of the pact.\nGM also for the first time disclosed that it will gain several benefits from the pact, including greater worker mobility and certain exclusions from its promise to guarantee employment at 95 percent of current levels over the next three years.\n\"Greater worker mobility will make it easier for General Motors to relocate UAW members and thus will decrease the number of employees that GM must pay income security protection,\" the company said in the filing.\nUnder its past three contracts, GM has agreed to continue to pay workers who are idled. The automaker spent $1.21 billion on such payments in the 1993-96 contract, and pledged to make $4.33 billion available for future payments, if needed, under the new contract.\nThe 95-percent job guarantee is not expected to restrict GM's ability to reduce employment due to productivity gains or volume reductions. GM also said it preserves the company's ability to sell certain unprofitable parts plants.\nGM also said its Delco Electronics unit, which makes audio systems and a host of other electronics components for GM cars and trucks, will see its profit margins drop to the low diouble digit range from 15.9 percent in.\nGM said as its automotive operations move to cut costs, they will seek price cuts and will likely buy more electronic components from other suppliers. Delco, a part of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, now supplies about $900 in components for every GM vehicle, a figure that is expected to drop.\nEarlier Thursday, Hughes announced a management shakeup for Kokomo, Ind.-based Delco, naming Michael Burns as general manager, replacing the retiring Gary Dickinson. Burns was previously in charge of GM's Delphi Thermal Systems unit which makes vehicle radiators and climate control systems.\n", "The Australian government will release the Wallis Inquiry's report into Australia's financial system on Wednesday at midday (0200 GMT) and is expected to respond to some parts of the report.\nThe five-person inquiry, set up in June last year and chaired by businessman Stan Wallis, took 268 submissions from the financial sector's main players about various options for reform.  \nThese players' views on various reforem options were detailed in the inquiry's 415 discussion paper released in late November.\nTheir positions and views on the various options follow.\nSCRAPPING THE 'SIX PILLARS' MERGER POLICY\nIN FAVOUR - National Australia Bank Ltd, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, St George Bank Ltd and Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said bank mergers should be judged in the same way as other sectors -- by the ACCC on competition grounds alone.\nThey said big bank mergers would not necessarily harm competition because of new technology and global competition. Such mergers would create efficiencies, lower costs and could create Australian banks big enough to compete overseas.\nAGAINST - Finance Sector Union (FSU), National Farmers Federation (NFF) and Australian Consumer Association (ACA) said big bank mergers would concentrate too much 'economic power' in too few hands.\nEQUIVOCAL - The Federal Treasury said it was also concerned about the concentration of economic power, but did not explicitly favour the retention of \"Six Pillars\". The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said one merger of the big four into three would not create prudential risk problems, but a cut to two banks would.\nALLOWING BIG BANK TAKEOVERS BY FOREIGNERS\nIN FAVOUR - The Treasury, ACCC, St George Bank and Citibank argued foreign investment in and takeovers of big banks should be allowed because it created extra competition. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said globalisation and liberalisation of trade meant the removal of such restrictions was inevitable.\nAGAINST - ANZ said foreign takeovers may see head offices shifted and create brain drain, citing the New Zealand example. Life office Colonial Ltd and Westpac noted community concern over need for Australian ownership and control of key assets.\nSCRAPPING RULES LIMITING EQUITY STAKES IN BANKS TO 15 PCT IN FAVOUR - Treasury, ACCC, life office National Mutual said restrictions on industrials and other corporates owning 10 percent of a bank (or 15 percent with government approval) should be removed to open banks up to normal competitive pressures of having strong shareholders and allow better access to capital markets.\nAGAINST - Life office and insurer MLC Life questioned logic of allowing anyone to buy a big stake in a bank, saying it may lead to investors pulling out in times of crisis, weakening safety of banking system.\nCREATION OF A MEGA-REGULATOR, REMOVAL OF RBA'S PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISORY ROLE\nIN FAVOUR - AMP, National Mutual, Colonial Mutual, NAB and the Treasury said mega-regulator would be more efficient, help break down barriers to competition and remove moral hazard problem for government of government-owned RBA being responsible for stopping banks from falling over. They also said prudential regulation and monetary policy conduct by RBA may create conflict of interest.\nAGAINST - Most banks, the RBA and ISC said the RBA should keep prudential powers over banks as RBA was the only entity able to inject liquidity to save banks in crisis and had market knowledge and skills to monitor bank's prudential safety levels.\nCLARIFICATION OF NON GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEE\nIN FAVOUR - RBA, Treasury, Westpac, National Mutual said the current situation where deposits are not government guaranteed should be clarified so depositors know RBA will try to ensure deposits are repaid, but cannot guarantee deposits. The current implied government guarantee also favoured banks over other competitors, they said.\nDEPOSIT INSURANCE SCHEME\nAGAINST - Most submissions opposed deposit insurance, saying it increased moral hazard problem and penalised bank deposits in favour of mutual funds, who do not have deposit insurance.\nOPENING UP ACCESS TO THE BANK PAYMENTS, SETTLEMENTS SYSTEM\nIN FAVOUR - NAB, Treasury, National Mutual, Aussie Home Loans and various Credit Unions said access should be opened up to non-banks and life groups to increase competition, so long as deposit-taking institutions meet minimum capital requirements and were overseen by RBA as banks are now.\nAGAINST - RBA, CBA, ANZ, Westpac, St George Bank and Colonial said the payments system was so crucial to overall health of economy, it should only be open to banks.\n-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730\n", "Mounting concerns about the loss of both two top executives and an equity stake in terrestrial digital TV sent shares in pay-television giant BSkyB diving further on Monday and analysts forecasts more weakness to come.\nAround 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) has been wiped off the value of British Sky Broadcasting since last week and some analysts said the shares, which fell 14.5p to 483p in afternoon trade, could tumble to 350p. News Corp Ltd is the largest shareholder in BSkyB.\n\"There has quite clearly been a re-rating in the last week and I think it's going to continue,\" said Jason Crisp, media analyst at brokers SocGen.\nAnother broker said only in \"wildly optimistic\" cases could the shares be valued even at 450p.\nNegative weekend newspaper reports helped compound last week's share falls sparked by a report in the Financial Times that BSkyB could be shut out of the bidding for new digital TV licences, experts said.\nThe Financial Times reported last week the television watchdog, the Independent Television Commission, had told BSkyB it should drop its one-third stake in a consortium with commercial TV groups Carlton Communications and Granada Group.\nBSkyB was enjoying an effective monopoly on pay- television and the watchdog was concerned about market domination, the FT said.\nThe report, which remains unconfirmed, followed last week's announcement that BSkyB's respected chief executive Sam Chisolm was stepping down and deputy managing director David Chance was becoming a consultant.\nSocGen's Crisp said the stock, which had hit an intraday 1997 high of 669p on February 14, had been vastly over-rated and should be trading nearer 400p.\nHe noted apart from the possible loss of its equity stake in its digital terrestrial TV consortium, called British Digital Broadcasting, and the loss of two very talented and experienced staff, flat satellite dish sales and rising operating costs were hitting the shares.\n\"All these things make you think it should be on a more typical PE (price earnings ratio) multiple of other big media companies,\" he added.\nAt 400p, the stock would have a more reasonable PE of 22 times next year, compared to one nearer 30 times before the share correction, Tysoe said.\nCredit Suisse First Boston was even more negative. \"We'd just re-iterate from our call last week that fundamental value on BSkyB is about 450p even in wildly optimistic cases, about 350-400p in more reasoned scenarios,\" it stated in a note.\nBut Mike Woodcock, media analyst at Nikko, said the share price fall had been overdone and he would recommend buying the shares under five pounds.\nHe said that in the short-term, the news on BDB, a business he valued at around 400 million pounds, was positive from a financial point of view.\nCompensation is tipped by the Financial Times at 75 million pounds. BSkyB can also keep some 100 million pounds which it was going to invest in the joint venture.\n\"Is the news of BDB and Sam Chisolm stepping down enough to warrant 1.7 billion pounds being wiped from the value of BSkyB? I would say no,\" Woodcock said. \"The real benefits for BSkyB are in the provision of programming rather than in the equity stake.\"\nBut he said as traditionally high operating margins were squeezed -- partly because payments to show English Premier League soccer are set to rise to 160 million pounds per year from August -- he was expecting flat pre-tax profits of 309 million pounds in 1998 and 1997.\nOther longer-term concerns, he said, were about how independent BSkyB was from media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, its leading shareholder -- and how much News Corp would benefit from the success of the pay-television giant.\nThe ITC hopes to decide by the end of this month on whether to award digital terrestrial television licences to BDB or a rival consortium run by cable and broadcast group NTL Inc.\n", "The government's latest auction of the airwaves concluded Friday after raising a disappointing $13.6 million for Uncle Sam, with licenses for some wireless communications markets fetching just $1 apiece.\nThe total was way short of the $1.8 billion that Congress was banking on to help eliminate the deficit. The results also buttressed the view that spectrum sales cannot be counted on as big money raisers -- as they have been in the past.\n\"The spectrum is being managed in a willy-nilly, haphazard fashion,\" complained Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Representative Billy Tauzin, R-La., the telecommunications subcommittee chairman.\n\"The budget crunchers are playing with monopoly money and we're playing with real dollars.\"\nThe Federal Communications Commission sold the rights for a piece of spectrum that will allow users to hook up to the Internet over the airwaves, set up wireless local telephone networks and operate location services to pinpoint vehicles.\nTop bidders were units of BellSouth Corp., which bid $6.2 million for 22 licenses in Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans and elsewhere; a Bell Atlantic Corp.-Nynex Corp. joint venture, which bid $1.6 million for eight licenses in Boston, New York, Washington and other cities; and Comcast Corp., which plunked down $1.5 million for 17 licenses around the nation.\nAnalysts and FCC officials blamed the poor results on the speedy timetable Congress required for the sale, the difficult times wireless companies now face raising money, and a flood of new companies into the wireless business.\nSeven licenses -- in Milwaukee, St. Louis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Des Moines, Iowa, and Omaha, Neb. -- sold for just $1. Licenses for Guam and American Samoa drew zero bidders.\n\"The climate surrounding the auction was awful,\" said Mark Lowenstein of Yankee Group Inc., a Boston consulting firm. \"It's not going to make much of a dent in the national debt.\"\nThe FCC put 128 licenses on the block in a sale that began April 15. It was the 14th airwaves sale.\nThe auctions have netted the government about $23 billion over the past three years, far more than expected. But prices have begun to slide as more spectrum is sold, contributing to financial woes among wireless carriers and raising doubts over whether the government will collect all the money it is owed.\n\"This sends the strongest signal possible to the FCC, Congress and the White House to reassess their spectrum plans for future auctions,\" said Elliott Hamilton, an analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm.\nTo help balance the budget, Congress last year forced the FCC to hold the auction by April 15 and to collect the proceeds by Sept. 30, the last day of the 1997 fiscal year.\nFCC officials said the timetable did not give potential bidders time to develop rational business plans and drum up financing.\nThe nation's broadcasters -- who are in the transition to digital television and must return their existing analogue licenses to the FCC for auction -- point to the poor results as a reason for scuttling future auctions.\nBut FCC chairman Reed Hundt disagreed.\n\"Anybody who says this auction was a failure is basing it on budget predictions that we never bought into.

He said freight charges added a further $25 per tonne. This would put the c&amp;f (cost and freight) price on arrival in China at $621 a tonne.\nIn comparison, South American soybean oil is arriving in China at about $560 a tonne c&amp;f, he said, adding \"It's a big spread.\"\n\"People are clamouring for (soybean oil) import licences now,\" another regional trader told Reuters.\nChina on Monday purchased a total of 35,000 tonnes of U.S. soybean oil for February shipment, U.S. exporters in Chicago said.  \nOne position for 25,000 tonnes was slated for shipment from the U.S. Gulf for around $512 per tonne FOB, the other 10,000 tonnes for shipment from Norfolk at $510 a tonne FOB.\nU.S. exporters say China has been seen actively buying South American vegetable oil. They estimated purchases at around 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes of Brazilian and Argentinian product.\nChina's total 1996 soybean oil imports were 1.3 million tonnes, with imports in December alone at 91,000 tonnes.\nJanuary and February import figures are expected to show a dip because of Western and Chinese holidays, traders said, adding it would probably be made up in the second quarter of 1997.\nWestern and Chinese traders have said they do not understand how the government administers the import licencing system given that permits were issued for only 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of the 1.3 million tonnes of soybean oil imported in 1996.\nSoybean oil imported without a licence is subject to import duty of 120 percent, compared to licenced imports which are subject to a 13 percent import duty and 13 percent value-added tax (VAT) on top of that.  \nFears of an official crackdown on soybean oil arriving without permits arose last week on news that one 20,000-tonne cargo of U.S. oil had been held up at a Chinese port.\nA trader involved in the sale told Reuters at the time the huge gap between China's domestic price and the international price could see Chinese importers placing orders without the necessary import licences.\nSouth American and U.S. soybean oil, once refined, is costing around 6,600 yuan ($795) a tonne, compared to 7,200 to 7,300 yuan ($867-879) per tonne for the domestic product.\nHowever, traders said soybean import licences are now being made available on a regular basis and the 20,000-tonne cargo had been discharged.\n($1=8.3 yuan)\n-- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004\n", "A group of 56 Chinese writers, former officials and academics has petitioned Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin to save cultural relics from the gigantic Three Gorges dam which would flood huge tracts of land.\nAncient tombs and temples were threatened by a dearth of government funds and official under-reporting of those relics that warranted saving, according to the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\"The hearts of relic protection departments are like burning fire with 10,000 worries and misgivings,\" it said of the lack of funds.\nAbout 130 historical sites, some of them dating to the Stone Age, could be flooded as soon as next year.\nThe sites include Qing dynasty (1644-1911) temples, an entire street from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and stone carvings from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).\nRelocation of many relics had been delayed due to lack of funds, the letter said, adding that the damage would worsen unless government funds for relocation were provided.\nThe letter dated August 8 was signed by prominent female writer Bing Xin, former ambassador to the United States Chai Zemin and former minister of culture Wang Meng.\nOthers include Su Bingqi, president of the Archaeological Society, and Yu Weichao, curator of the Museum of Chinese History who is in charge of relocating relics.\nArchaeologists had designated 829 buried relics near a reservoir under construction as needing protection. The sites covered a total area of more than 20 million square metres (215 million square ft), but the government has agreed to protect one tenth of the area due to a lack of funds, it said.\nSome ancient tombs and relics have already disappeared under the onslaught of bulldozers, the letter said.\nConstruction of the controversial dam was expected to submerge 632 square km (244 square miles) of land in central China's Hubei province and the southwestern province of Sichuan.\nIt would force the relocation of 840,000 people from up to 200 villages and towns, according to 1991-92 estimates.\nEnvironmentalists have described the project as a potential ecological disaster, leading to the destruction of a scenic mountain region and the extinction of endangered species.\nThe Three Gorges dam -- the world's biggest water control project --  was expected to ease seasonal flooding by creating a massive reservoir in Hubei to store waters from rains.\nThe 6,000-km (3,500-mile) Yangtze river -- China's longest -- and its tributaries have triggered floods throughout much of China's history.\nThe project, expected to cost $30 billion by its completion in 2009, would also help ease China's crippling shortage of electric power.\n", "Britain's takeover watchdog on Friday handed out its strongest sanction to BZW, investment banking arm of Barclays Bank, over its conduct of a bid defence for Northern Electric last year.\nThe Takeover Panel \"criticised\" BZW for failing to disclose all the relevant facts, including a performance fee, during hearings over the conduct of the deal last December.\n\"This is the strongest sanction the panel can take and there is no further action intended,\" Alistair Defriez, director general of the panel told Reuters. \"We have no power to impose a fine.\"\nBZW said it was pleased that the Panel had found it had not deliberately concealed the performance fee and that there was no suggestion that the fee was an inducement for BZW to buy Northern shares which would have been in breach of the Code on Takeovers and Mergers.\nThe case stemmed from a 782 million pound ($1.2 billion) bid for regional electricity company Northern by CE Electric, a unit of CalEnergy Co Inc of the U.S. which proved to be hotly contested and the result extremely close.\nNorthern failed in its defence against CE, after the British company lost an appeal to the panel to reverse an extension of the offer period which enabled CE to narrowly win the bid.\nThe offer extension came after CE raised concerns about the purchase of Northern Electric shares by its advisers British merchant bank Schroders and BZW and a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds to BZW which was a performance fee.\nNorthern in turn launched its own appeal against the extension of the deadline because at the time of the first cut-off date, CE had fallen short of the total needed to win.\nBut the panel finally ruled against Northern and BZW was heavily criticised in the press for effectively losing the bid for its client.\nOn Friday, the panel said it accepted that BZW had not deliberately concealed the fee but that the firm recognised that it should have considered the fee relevant to the panel's deliberations.\nThe criticism of BZW comes hot on the heels of a 90 million pound derivatives loss at its rival NatWest Markets and is bound to rekindle discussion of the conduct of British investment banks.\nBZW has consistently defended its actions, saying that the performance fee was not based on the outcome of the bid and had nothing to do with its relatively unusual plan to aid the defence by purchasing nearly 20 million pounds worth of Northern shares.\nBut insiders accept that BZW made errors of judgement that undoubtedly led to Northern losing its independence.

Fresh talks on Wednesday have yet to lead to a solution.\nThe OSZ has said it will make its decision on prolonging the strike by 6 p.m. on Wednesday (1700 GMT).\nThe Association of Unions of Rail Workers (OSZ) wants the government to implement a long-term plan to revive the decrepit railway system saying that waste and inefficiency in the system should be cleaned up before jobs are threatened.\nLeaders of the OSZ reported that 75 to 80 percent of the more than 100,000 railway workers had joined the strike, but management of the railway company said over 60 percent showed up for work and signed a petition against the strike.\nThe Czech news agency CTK reported that an attempt to use workers who ignored the strike resulted in the operation of a just five trains on Wednesday, but the system was mostly idle.\nThe state railway company, Ceske Drahy, lost six billion crowns ($216.4 million) in 1996, and expects to lose seven billion crowns this year, but the government has been unable to put together a viable plan for reversing the losses.\nThe Czech daily Mlada Fronta on Wednesday reported that the last unpublished government plan, which infuriated the unions and led to the strike, called for layoffs of up to 40 percent of Ceske Drahy's more than 100,000 workers.\nThe plan also called for the sale of 20 percent of the rail system, and a decommissioning of another 20 percent, it said.\nAn effort to reconstruct Ceske Drahy ended in 1994 when the conservative government backed off privatisation plans to halt a threatened strike just hours before it was to begin.\nThis time, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has given ominous warnings that the unions \"may go too far\" with the strike.\nMost major Czech firms have said a short-term strike will have little effect on their operations, though the coal mining company Mostecka Uhelna Spolecnost a.s. said it was losing between 15-20 million crowns a day due to the action.\ne($ = 27.73 Czech Crowns)\n", "The bidding war for Conrail Inc. appears to be drawing to a close, but big legal and regulatory battles are right around the corner.\nIndustry analysts said Friday rival bidders CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. were unlikely to offer much more for Philadelphia-based Conrail, but both sides will pursue the fight in court, before regulators and in the marketplace.\n\"That is the whole process that takes place over the course of 1997 -- the battle for market share as opposed to Conrail shares,\" said Anthony Hatch, analyst at NatWest Securities Corp.\nCSX, based in Richmond, Va., on Thursday raised its offer for Conrail to give shareholders an extra $870 million in a friendly cash-and-stock merger. Based on Friday's stock activity, the deal is worth $9.3 billion, or about $102 per Conrail share.\nA source close to CSX told Reuters on Thursday that CSX and Conrail hoped the revised deal would end the bidding war.\nBut just hours after CSX and Conrail unveiled the new terms of their planned merger, Norfolk Southern raised its all-cash offer by $500 million to about $10.5 billion, or $115 a share.\n\"If someone were to start to bid higher than this, they probably wouldn't get the economies out of the deal to make it work so the bidding war, I think, has come to the end,\" said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group.\nAlthough Norfolk Southern's bid has been higher throughout the two-month takeover fight, Conrail contends the union with CSX is a better strategic fit.\nIndustry experts said Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, which has the financial power to bid more than $10.5 billion, merely wants to preserve the spread between the two offers while it fights a key aspect of the Conrail-CSX pact in court.\nNorfolk Southern is challenging part of the transaction that prohibits either CSX or Conrail from seeking another merger partner before 1999.\nSome analysts and investors said that if the exclusivity provision is not thrown out after a Jan. 9 hearing in federal judge in Philadelphia, it could guarantee a victory for CSX because shareholders could not wait two years for a deal with Norfolk Southern.\nNorfolk Southern last month lost a court fight in which it challenged previous terms of the deal, including an exclusivity provision that ruled out other talks before July 1997.\n\"This is a sign that they're not going to go bananaas (with a very high offer). If they're able to break the lock-up provision, they have a good bid,\" Hatch said.\n\"It was the right thing to do to keep pressure on the (Conrail) board,\" said one takeover stock trader, referring to investors who were unhappy with the Conrail board's decision to pursue the lower of the two bids.\nThe court case is expected to hinge on whether Conrail's agreeing to the extended exclusivity period is within the broad discretion allowed a board under Pennsylvania law, said Charles Yablon, a professor of corporate law at Cardozo University in New York.\n\"They're pushing the outside of the envelope and trying to take maximum advantage of the leeway that Pennsylvania law gives them,\" Yablon said. But if they can legally justify the move, CSX will probably prevail, he said.\nFew analysts were predicting the outcome, but the war was expected to continue no matter which company wins in court.\nAfter the court fight, the next battle site will be Washington where the losing bidder is expected to vehemently challenge the merger. The deal already is expected to face intense scrutiny from the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that oversees railroads.\n\"You're going to have a lot of opposition to this,\" PNC's Vincent said, citing railroads, shippers and state agencies that are expected to express their opinions when the transaction reaches the regulatory stage.\nLast week, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it would intervene in any merger involving Conrail.\nConrail stock fell 87.5 cents to $99.875 trading on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock fell 50 cents to $43.25 and Norfolk Southern shares rose $1.125 to $89.50, also on NYSE.\n", "TCF Financial Corp. and Standard Financial Inc. said Monday they signed a definitive agreement for TCF to acquire Standard Financial for $424 million in stock and cash.\nThe deal was announced two days after Milwaukee-based bank holding company Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corp. said it would acquire cross-town thrift Security Capital Corp. for about $945 million in cash and stock, or about $92 a share.\nBoth deals help the buyer increase market share in the consolidating Midwest banking arena. Marshall &amp; Ilsley said it will increase its market share to 19.2 percent in Wisconsin, with Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp., the number two bank in the state, at 12.1 percent of deposits.\nAt the same time, the acquisition of $2.4 billion asset Standard Financial and its 14 full-service offices would strengthen TCF's franchise in Chicago, allowing it to do more cost affective advertising than it could before the deal, William Cooper, chairman of $7.1 billion asset TCF said.\n\"We believe this merger will produce long-term revenue enhancements and meaningful cost savings,\" Cooper said in a news release.\nTCF expects to save about $4 million annually once the two banks' operations are combined in Illinois and to generate more than $4 million in revenues from the deal by offering more products to Standard Financial customers, changing the mix of Standard Financial's loan portfolio to add higher yielding loans and through fees at its automatic teller machines.\n\"Standard certainly has the customer profile TCF looks for, but I thought the price that they paid was fairly rich based on Standard's earnings,\" Stephen Skiba, analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp, said.\nThe combined company would have $10 billion in assets and 276 financial services offices and more than 900 automatic teller machines in five Midwest states.\nTCF, a savings bank holding company based in Minneapolis, will offer about $25 for each Standard share. Standard stockholders may choose to receive cash or TCF shares or a combination of the two. Between 40 percent and 60 percent of the purchase would be paid in TCF stock, and the rest in cash.\nThe exchange ratio for shares would depend on the average price of TCF stock during the 30 trading days before the deal closes.\nAnalysts also thought Marshall &amp; Ilsley paid a full price for Security Capital, a $3.66 billion asset thrift with 42 bank branches and 10 lending offices throughout Wisconsin.\nThe $92 a share acquisition price includes about 12.3 million Marshall &amp; Ilsley common shares and $376 million in cash and is a premium over the $84.75 closing price for Security Capital Friday.\n\"It's pretty pricey,\" said Thomas Maier, analyst at EVEREN Securities. \"You can argue that given what it does for them in terms of share in the state of Wisconsin, it's worth it.\"\nWisconsin is seen as one target area for Midwest regional banks to make acqusitions to enhance market share.\n\"I think it's a defensive move on M&amp;I's part, that if they didn't grow within the Wisconsin market, it was more likely they would be a takeover target,\" Skiba said.\nSkiba also said the acquisition of Standard Financial by TCF could make other Chicago-area thrifts, including MAF Bancorp Inc. and St. Paul Bancorp Inc., even more likely acquisition targets.\n\"I think there's becoming a scarcity value on the large independent thrift franchises that are left,\" Skiba said.\nTCF shares fell $0.625 to $44 Monday, Standard Financial rose $2.375 to $23.50, Marshall &amp; Ilsley fell $0.56 to $36.75, and Security Capital rose $0.75 to $85.50.\n", "Launching a fresh assault on the U.S. minivan market, Toyota Motor Co. introduced its 1998 Sienna at the North American International Auto Show Wednesday, describing the vehicle as the \"Camry of minivans.\"\nBut capacity constraints will prohibit the Sienna from loosening Chrysler's Corp.'s iron grip on the 1.1 million unit market.\nDesigned in Japan, the Sienna features more conservative styling than the Chrysler products, which dominate the U.S. market for the popular vehicles about a 46 percent stake.\nToyota's low-key approach carried over to the introduction of its new vehicle.\nShunning the rappeling executives and mock thunderstorms of other automakers at the show, Toyota simply pulled back a black curtain, without fanfare, to reveal the vehicle.\nThe front-wheel-drive Sienna will be built off a slightly longer version of the Camry sedan platform. It will come with essentially the same 3.0 litre V6 engine and four-speed automatic transmission as the Camry.\nLike minivans from Chrysler and General Motors Corp., the Sienna will offer an optional fourth door on the driver's side.\nPricing has not been determined. But Dave Illingworth, general manager of the Toyota Division in the United States, said it will be below the more than $30,000 pricetag the Previa started at and will be aimed at the middle of the minivan market.\nThe rear-wheel drive Previa, which was introduced in 1990, will be dropped when the Sienna goes on sale in the fall, Illingworth said.\nToyota expects to sell 50,000 to 60,000 Siennas -- all it will be able to produce at its plant in Georgetown, Ky. The facility has annual volume capacity of about 500,000 units, but is also responsible for making the Camry and Avalon.\nIllingworth said Toyota has no plans for additional capacity expansion in North America and does not expect to start producing the Siennas in Japan for export to the U.S. market.\nBy replacing the poor-selling Previa, Toyota is hoping to give existing Toyota buyers a durable, moderately priced alternative.\n\"This is an attempt to keep our buyers in the franchise,\" he said. \"I don't see us challenging Chrysler.\"\nNeither does Dennis Pawley, executive vice president of manufacturing for Chrysler, who attended the Sienna unveiling. Although the minivan segment of the market has not grown for about six months, Pawley said the battle for market share is not likely to hurt Chrysler, which has the most loyal minivan owners.\n\"This is going to hurt GM and Ford (Motor Co)  much more than it's going to hurt our sales,\" he said.\nBut Richard Wagoner, president of GM's North American Operations, said the automaker plans to gain share when its new line of minivans begin arriving in heavier volumes throughout this year. However, he added, \"We never underestimate Toyota.\"\nSusan Jacobs, who runs the industry consulting firm Jacobs &amp; Associates, said the tight production volumes indicates Toyota will sell all it can make of the new vans. She predicted the Sienna's conservative looks will not hurt its sales.\n\"You don't need to be the style leader to succeed in minivans,\" she said.\n", "New York state utility regulators Thursday approved the $23 billion Nynex Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp. merger, subject to conditions the regional telephone giants must agree to by the end of March.\nConsumer groups opposed to the merger that have demanded rate rebates for New York customers blasted the state Public Service Commission's decision as a sellout.\nNew York became the last state in Nynex's six-state service region to approve the merger, which still faces hurdles in Washington and New York.\nThe merger of the Baby Bells would create the nation's largest local phone company serving customers in 12 Northeastern states and Washington.\n\"The bedrock requirements of our approval are improved service quality and ensuring that ratepayers see tangible benefits,\" New York State Public Service Commission Chairman John O'Mara said.\nHe said in an interview that, while there would be no immediate rate reduction, \"We have attached conditions that we believe will bring rate reduction.\"\nThe merger is being held up by federal regulators who are reviewing its competitive implications.\nBell Atlantic spokesman Eric Rabe said the companies now expected the deal to close after April 22, the previous target date. \"Obviously, things are moving slower than we had hoped,\" Rabe said.\nHe said the Justice Department had still not indicated when it would act on the deal. He said the Federal Communications Commission said it would take 30 days after the Justice Department finishes its review before it took action.\nThe companies welcomed the commission's decision but said in a joint statement they were still assessing the conditions.\nIn addition, state Attorney General Dennis Vacco expressed concern the decision did not go far enough to protect ratepayers and said he was reviewing the deal.\nAfter several months of hearings, the three-member panel voted for the merger and the conditions in a 15-minute meeting in Albany, the state capital.\nThe commission said the combined company must not move major operations that were located in New York state before the merger and that its headquarters be in New York, which New York-based Nynex and Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic have agreed to.\nThe regulators focused on improving customer service in New York, where consumer groups have berated Nynex for offering what they call the worst service in the nation.\nThe approval calls on Nynex to accelerate spending to improve customer service, including hiring up to 1,000 new support staff by the end of 1997 in New York state.\nA Nynex spokesman said the company has been hiring service personnel over the past year and would hire more in 1997. Last year, it hired 3,600 employees in service-related areas, three-fourths of them in New York state. Overall, Nynex has just over 68,000 employees.\nConsumer groups were swift to criticize the commission's decision.\n\"We are outraged that this commission approved a merger that is completely anticompetitive,\" said Robert Ceisler of the New York Citizens Utility Board ratepayers' group. \"The commission has sanctioned a more powerful and richer monopoly.\"\nConsumer advocates had demanded the commission at least force Nynex to give consumers immediate rebates to compensate for the reduced competition and greater efficiencies expected from the merger.\nOther conditions cited were having Bell Atlantic pledge to observe existing agreements between regulators and Nynex, that Nynex employee pension funds be protected, and that Bell Atlantic grant regulators access to its records.\nNynex stock closed down 37.5 cents at $47 while Bell Atlantic fell 75 cents to $63.625, both in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "Hong Kong's Finance Secretary Donald Tsang, set to unveil the annual budget under China's watchful eye, is a man of conservative pedigree when it comes to economics but an outspoken liberal in the political arena.\nTsang, who appears in hallmark striped business shirts and colourful bow-ties, broke a 153-year colonial mould by becoming Hong Kong's first non-British financial secretary in 1995, crowning a 30-year career in the civil service.\nSo far, he has made no stunning changes to the cautious budget policies that have made Hong Kong rich, a posture that should endear him to Hong Kong's soon-to-be sovereign power, China.\nThe 52-year-old staunch Roman Catholic minces no words when he advertises his cautious, conservative economic approach.\n\"My policy is not to create excitement in the management of our public finances, nor do I have any appetite for thrills and spills,\" Tsang said when he took on the job.\nLast week Tsang dismissed accusations that the government was acting like a miser sitting on a cash mountain while holding back welfare spending.\nBut he was also quick to dismiss accusations that China, due to take back the territory from Britain on July 1, had put the brakes on social spending.\n\"In formulating our expenditure programme we had not been overly influenced, we have not been affected, by whatever they call political pressure,\" he told a meeting of central bankers.\nThe budget to be unveiled on Wednesday has for the first time been worked out in hand with Chinese experts. It was part of the Sino-British negotiations on details of the sovereignty change, and came against the political backdrop of sour relations between London and Beijing.\nSince he delivered his maiden budget a year ago, Tsang has landed himself in political controversy.\nHe has spoken out against China's plans to roll back key clauses in some of Hong Kong's civil liberties laws -- putting himself at odds with Hong Kong's future leader.\n\"If you can't convince the people of Hong Kong, people may take to the streets, some may keep their frustration in their hearts, some in the civil service may quit.

If she is not able to get a quick and amicable resolution then she is still looking at legal action on the grounds that she was constructively dismissed,\" said John Farr, a partner at law firm Herbert Smith.\nPrecise details of what precipitated Horlick's sudden departure from MGAM, depicted by the firm as an attempt by her to lure colleagues with her to a rival, have yet to emerge and former colleagues refused to comment on newspaper reports.\n\"Basically I just want to get on with my job and look after my clients,\" one, who declined to be named, told Reuters. Others also appeared to have rallied behind MGAM chief executive Robert Smith, arguing they were getting on with the business of reassuring clients and managing their funds.\nMGAM has run an intensive damage-limitation campaign, writing to all clients of its 18 billion pound ($29.89 billion) British pension fund business and set up meetings with some.\nBut this did not prevent two more from voicing their concerns over events at the firm, still reeling from last year's revelations of irregularities at three of its retail investment funds which led to the sacking of fund manager Peter Young.\nYoung, who denies any involvement in criminal activity, is now under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO).\nThe London Borough of Lewisham, which has 300 million pounds under sole management with MGAM, said it was concerned at recent developments and would decide at a meeting in March whether to continue with MGAM or to put the contract out to tender.\nAnd Norfolk County Council, which has some 390 million pounds with MGAM adopted a similar tone, saying it was \"naturally concerned by recent events...and is keeping a close watch upon developments\" but it was not taking any action.\nMeanwhile Farr said Horlick's first priority was to get her job back as head of British pension fund business at MGAM but if this did not happen she wanted compensation.\nEarlier his client said the issue was not about money but about clearing her name. Farr did not quantify the level of compensation Horlick would be seeking but said she was entitled to a year's notice and her bonus was \"still open to discussion\".\nHorlick, who only days before her suspension was promoted to managing director by chief executive Robert Smith, wanted the matter resolved as quickly as possible, Farr said, adding he hoped this could be \"within the week or the next few days\".\nMGAM is owned by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment banking arm of Germany's powerful Deutsche Bank.\nHorlick has strenously denied allegations that she was about to move with her team to a rival firm, widely rumoured to have been Dutch bank ABN AMRO, but said she met a friend from the bank in December at what she insists was a personal lunch.\nMGAM declined comment on the latest developments except to repeat that it had no plans for any action of its own as Horlick was no longer one of its employees.\n($1=.6021 Pound)\n", "The Australian government appointed stockbrokers on Thursday to manage the proposed sharemarket float of its telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp, which will be the nation's largest privatisation.\nThe float is estimated to raise a minimum of A$8.0 billion (US$6.32 billion) -- and perhaps much more.\nFinance Minister John Fahey said he wanted the Telstra float, through the sale of a third of the government's 100-percent stake, to go through by the end of the year.\n\"I want it ready to go to the market this year, this calendar year,\" Fahey told reporters.\n\"But I am not saying it will,\" he said. He added it was unclear whether the float of other international telephone companies would affect the float timing. France Telecom and Italy's state-owned Stet are also planned for sale this year.\nAustralian brokers J.B Were &amp; Son, U.S.-based CS First Boston and European based ABN AMRO/Rothschild had been appointed global co-ordinators for the float, Fahey said.\nHe said J.B Were, Ord Minnett of Australia,  CS First Boston, U.S.-Australian consortium Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank, Daiwa of Japan, ABN AMRO/Rothschild and German owned Deutsche Morgan Grenfell were appointed joint lead managers.\nThe float would not be underwritten in Australia, where 65 percent of the offer is to be sold. But the shares offered in the United States would be underwritten and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the minister said.\nTwo percent of the offer is set aside for Telstra employees and foreign investors are entitled to 35 percent.\nFahey would not comment on how much the government expects to raise from the partial sale of Telstra. \"I want to get optimum value for taxpayers of Australia,\" Fahey said.\nAustralia's Liberal-National Party coalition government was elected just over a year ago promsing to sell one-third of Telstra, with A$1.0 billion of the sale proceeds going to set up an environment fund.\nThe float of Telstra will far exceed other privatisations by the Australian government in recent years. The sale of Commonwealth Bank of Australia raised a total of A$8.0 billion, in two separate tranches, and the 1995 float of Qantas Airways Ltd raised A$1.45 billion.\nThe announcement was a boon to Australia's stockbroking community whose Christmas bonuses will be swelled by the Telstra float.

It's just too high and this must be addressed before the central bank will move rates,\" said one London-based economist.\nForeign exchange traders said the crown was unaffected by January's CPI figures since they were in line with forecasts.\nThe crown was fixed by the central bank on Monday at 5.28 percent above its dollar/mark basket midpoint, slightly stronger than its +5.14 percent fixing from last Friday.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "SBC Communications Inc said on Tuesday that soaring demand for wireless services is beating its expectations and shows no signs of slowing down in 1997.\n\"I'm amazed by how much momentum we have. Frankly its in advance of our business plans, and its due to both the healthy economy and an overall exploding telecom marketplace,\" SBC Chief Financial Officer Don Kiernan told Reuters.\nSBC's U.S. wireless user base jumped by 20.2 percent to 4.4 million during 1996, with 739,000 customers added compared with an internal forecast of 600,000-650,000.\nThe company was a cent below First Call's analyst consensus with earnings per share of $0.90 for the fourth quarter compared with $0.83 a year earlier, though Kiernan said the miss was less once rounding errors were discounted.\nSBC shares, which lost as much as 1/2 immediately after the results, were unchanged at $52-3/4 at 1500 EST/2000 GMT.\nWireless is providing SBC with new outlets for services like caller ID and voice dialling, which gives and extra kick to revenues in a fast growing marketplace, Kiernan said.\nDuring 1996 1.9 million SBC wireless customers took cellular long distance, 42.5 percent of the total, which generated $60 million extra in revenues.\n\"As wireless customers realise its not that much more expensive to use a cellular phone to make a long distance call we could get a real windfall...,\" Kiernan said.\nOn top of this services such as Caller ID are a big boost to revenues and profits, first because they cost almost nothing to provide to each marginal user and because they help retain customers who might switch between providers.\n\"Revenue per customer in wireless is down only 1.5 percent from the prior year,\" Kiernan said. Wireless companies have come to expect bigger falls in average revenue per user as falling prices enable casual users to take a mobile phone.\nTraditionally, wireless providers cope by switching to cheaper methods of acquiring new customers through retailers or resellers to offset marginal revenue declines.\nBut Kiernan said value-added services help support the wireless revenue curve, even as costs decline.\nAlready SBC reaped over $1 billion in revenues in 1996 from value-added services, mostly on the wired network.\nIn wired networks a new generation of software-based features would be available in mid-1997 using advanced intelligent networks (AIN), Kiernan said.\nAIN means a phone or data network carries plenty of its own computing power and more information about a call than existing networks.\nDesktop video conferencing is available already, but others will include call management based on information extracted from caller-ID records. Eventually many of the new features will migrate to the wireless network too.\nKiernan said that SBC had just last week started selling a package of local and long distance calling, plus local and long distance wireless under the Cellular One brand in New York state.\n\"We will be rolling that out in our other out-of-region markets in Chicago, Washington/Baltimore, Boston during 1997, so that will further buoy up average revenue per customer,\" he said.

People will talk about it for years,\" veteran mine promoter Patrick Sheridan said in a recent interview.\nUntil now, Canada's biggest national mining scandal was the Windfall Oils and Mines Ltd. affair in the 1960s.\nDuring a copper and zinc rush in northern Ontario, mining promoters George and Viola MacMillan acquired claims rumored to have tremendous potential.\nFueled by rumors, Windfall's stock soared to more than C$5 ($3.60) from pennies in less than a month. Authorities pressured the MacMillans to release their drilling results.\nThe results showed the grand deposit as a dud. The stock collapsed, and Canada's government launched a royal commission to investigate.\nThe Kelly Commission found no evidence the MacMillans, who carted the drill samples around in their Cadillac, were the source of the rumors. But their actions promoted a belief by investors that the samples were valuable, the commission said.\nViola MacMillan went to jail briefly for stock manipulation.\nSheridan said the panel came up with a good report on how another Windfall could be avoided. But, like many government reports, it was shelved.\nThe earliest dashed mining hope in Canada was in 1575 when English explorer Martin Frobisher found what he believed to be gold on Baffin Island in the far north.\nWhen he returned to England with 1,500 tons of ore, the royal assayer told Frobisher he had worthless iron pyrites, also known as \"fool's gold.\"\nMore recent mining embarassments involved Timbuktu Gold Corp. and Cartaway Resources Corp.\nLast year, Timbuktu stock soared on a reported gold find in West Africa. But a new management team revealed the assays had been salted, or doctored, by unknown parties.\nWhen investors got the news, the stock plunged around C$23 ($16) to C$1.75 ($1.27).\nCartaway stock skyrocketed in April 1996 after it announced a copper-nickel find in Labrador, Newfoundland.\nThe news came amid the fever over the huge Voisey's Bay nickel and copper find, which Canadian nickel giant Inco Ltd. acquired for C$4.3 billion ($3.1 billion).\nCartaway's report, however, was based on a visual inspection of just one core sample by a geologist at the site. The stock sank more than C$20 ($14) to about C$2.80 ($2).\nRich deals such as Inco's takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp.'s $800 million acquisition of Arequipa Resources Ltd. fueled investor enthusiasm for mining plays. But analysts said it also might have impaired the market's judgment.\n\"It's a symptom of the times. There is a high degree of greed in the markets, not only in the mining industry but with regard to others, and investors tend to get complacent during these times,\" said John Ing, president of brokerage Maison Placements Canada in Toronto.\nAnother Canadian mining scandal eerily similar to Bre-X involved New Cinch Uranium Ltd. and its New Mexico gold find in the 1980s.\nWillroy Mines Ltd. bid for New Cinch after its stock rallied on rich assays performed by a U.S.-based lab, Chem-Tec.\nBut rumors about poor test results by another assayer sent the stock on a wild ride. The mob-style murder of a former Chem-Tec employee added to the intrigue.\nAfter a negative independent audit, New Cinch admitted the samples were contaminated and several lawsuits ensued. Willroy pulled out of the project.\nToday, investigators are probing the Bre-X embroglio as Canada's mining community tries to repair its tarnished image at home and abroad.\nSome said the past success of Canada's other mining companies should not be tarred by controversy about one small miner.\n\"Our mining industry is second to none,\" Peter Munk, chairman of Barrick, the world's second biggest gold miner, said recently. \"And no single rogue operation and no single deviant member can change these fundamentals.\"\n", "A successful bid by local billionaire Kerry Packer for publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd is not the sure thing many market players and media commentators believe, analysts said on Tuesday.\nBefore Packer can launch a bid for Fairfax, the government would have to first decide to drop the current cross-media rules and then pass any legislation through a hostile senate.  \nPacker would then have to offer a takeover premium on top of an already high Fairfax share price that was both tempting to existing shareholders and not too dilutive for Packer's fellow Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd shareholders.\n\"There's a few more hurdles to overcome yet,\" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett senior media analyst Vince Pepe.\n\"Getting (Prime Minister John) Howard to introduce legislation is one thing, but getting it through parliament while keeping his backbench appeased is another thing,\" Pepe said.  \n\"The amount of political fallout that's beginning might see him wondering whether it is such a clever thing after all,\" he said.\nHoward's cabinet was considering on Tuesday changes to the cross media rules set by the former Labor government that stop television station owners like Packer from buying a major newspaper group like Fairfax.\nHoward has already said the rules are outdated and his government is widely expected to drop them, allowing Packer to use his current 15 percent stake as a beachhead for a full scrip-based takeover bid.  \nBut Howard's position has come under increasing fire in recent days after Seven Network Ltd Chairman Kerry Stokes accused Howard of having done what he called a disgraceful deal with Packer and of playing king-maker.\nFormer conservative Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser wrote to Howard on Monday, calling on him not to lessen media diversity and Fairfax journalists went on strike on Tuesday morning to protest any government move to drop cross-media rules.\nA successful Packer takeover of Fairfax would mean Australia's major newspapers would be divided between Packer and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.  \nGovernment back-benchers have also written to Howard expressing their concern about the way changes are being considered.\nControversial independent senator Mal Colston threw up another roadblock in front of any media law changes earlier on Tuesday, threatening to vote against the government.\nThe fine balance in the senate means if Colston votes against the government, the balance of power transfers to the left-leaning Democrat and Green senators, who have said they oppose any further concentration of media ownership.  \n\"All the arrows are pointing in the right direction (for a takeover), but I wouldn't say it's a fait accompli,\" said a senior media analyst.\n\"It's (cross-media reform) got to get through the senate and the price has got to be reasonable,\" the analyst said.\nPacker and PBL, which would be the vehicle for the scrip-based bid that Packer foreshadowed last year, would have to pay the equivalent of at least A$3.50 for each Fairfax share, analysts said. Fairfax's shares were unchanged at A$3.25 at 1.30 p.m. (0330 GMT).  \nThat price may prove too painful for Packer and his fellow shareholders, who would be concerned about earnings dilution and would have to approve any deal, analysts said.\n\"Despite Packer's apparent obsession for Fairfax, he's not going to pay a stupid price for it and some people in the market are expecting a stupid price,\" said a Sydney media analyst.\n\"I'd be a pretty disappointed PBL shareholder if he was prepared to pay more than A$3.40 for it,\" the analyst said, adding that a A$3.40 price would be earnings dilutive given Fairfax's forecast earnings.\n\"At A$3.50 to A$3.60 it becomes pretty savagely dilutive.\"  \nAnalysts said the final roadblock to a successful Packer bid would be dislodging major Fairfax shareholders Brierley Investments Ltd, with about 20 percent, and Bankers Trust Australia with about 13 percent.\nBrierley in particular has said often and loudly that it is a long term shareholder with ambitions of its own to take a higher stake and has in recent years held onto its investments for long periods. Packer may also have competition.  \nThe Australian newspaper reported earlier on Tuesday that British publisher Pearson Plc was part of consortium called Australian Independent Newspapers (AIN) that was considering bidding for all or part of Fairfax.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n", "Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has thrown his support behind the creation of an independent market regulator, but analysts said on Monday it would take more than that to revive confidence in the embattled Prague bourse.\nKlaus, speaking after a meeting on market regulation on Sunday, said the Czech bourse was moving towards becoming a normal market after its creation under the mass voucher privatisation programme of 1992-95.\nEverybody understood this process would happen gradually, he said. But analysts and traders said that while the moves were a welcome start, only concrete results would be able to lure investors back to the market.\n\"It shows a trend that the government knows there is a problem and is working on solutions,\" said Jan Sykora, a broker at Wood and Company.\n\"But confidence in the Czech market has been decimated and there is a strong lack of confidence, especially among foreign investors...who now want to see real results, and not just proclamations.\"\nWhile markets in Poland and Budapest have posted solid gains this year, the Prague Stock Exchange has suffered. Since the beginning of September, a bear run triggered by a selloff by foreign investors has wiped about 20 percent off the market.\nRadim Bajgar of ING Barings called Klaus' comments positive, but results would be the best medicine for the market.\nForeign investors and some local players have been highly critical of the lack of transparency in Czech markets -- particularly the failure of the Securites Centre, where the overwhelming majority of trades are registered, to release detailed price information.\n\"A lot international clients shudder when you mention the Czech market. They just don't know what real prices here are because so little information comes from the Securities Centre, where so much of the trading occurs,\" said one fund manager.\nUntil now, Klaus has showed little enthusiasm for a plan by PSE Chairman Tomas Jezek to create a body modelled on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nKlaus has long believed market regulation, now conducted by a department in the Finance Ministry, should be minimal. But he capitulated on Sunday.\n\"As a long-term solution we want to create an independent capital supervision (body). That requires legislation and an number of other things,\" Klaus said after the meeting.\nHe also announced that all prices of OTC deals registered at the Central Securities Centre (SCP) would be published from February 1. He gave no indication of whether the names of buyers and sellers would also be released.\nJezek wants to create a Czech SEC by 1998 but Klaus gave no indication of when he thought it could be set up.\nKlaus said that as a first step the market supervision department of the Finance Ministry would be transformed into a \"Securities Bureau\" with more staff from February 1, 1997.\nAnalysts said that once more regulation was imposed, investors who have shunned Czech shares would probably return.\n\"Because most foreign investors have such a poor view of this market, they are under-invested here. So once you start to create better conditions, you should see it translate into a strong positive trend next year,\" Sykora said.\n", "For the second time in a row, the United Auto Workers union has chosen Ford Motor Co. to lead the union's labor contract negotiations with the Big Three U.S. automakers, officials said late on Tuesday.\nUAW vice president Ernest Lofton said union leaders notified Ford executives of the decision Tuesday, but added that the union was not viewing the company as a traditional \"strike target\" in the talks.\n\"They are the lead company in regards to resolving our 1996 negotiations,\" Lofton said Tuesday night in a brief interview on WDIV-TV.\nThe selection will allow the No. 2 U.S. automaker to negotiate an agreement that will serve as a pattern for rivals General Motors Corp and Chrysler Corp to follow.\nContracts covering nearly 400,000 U.S. hourly workers at all three companies expire September 14. Despite the conciliatory talk, Ford as the target company faces the threat of a national strike if it fails to reach an agreement before the expiration.\nFord spokesman Jon Harmon would only read the following statement Tuesday: \"We're hard at work negotiating with the UAW at the subcommittee level as well as at the main table, and we are encouraged by the tone of the negotiations,\" he said.\n\"Our team is working under the assumption that we will be closely involved in whatever transpires over the next two weeks. And that's been our preference all along.\"\nThe decision marks the second time in a row that the union has chosen Ford to lead its Big Three U.S. negotiations. Ford, which employs about 104,000 UAW members,  negotiated the current pact in 1993 and is widely viewed to have the best union relations among the three automakers.\nThe UAW's top priorities in the 1996 negotiations are improved job security for its workers and restrictions on the automakers' ability to shift work to lower-cost outside suppliers. Analysts say Ford has shown willingness to cooperate with the union on both fronts.\nGeneral Motors has been shrinking its workforce in an effort to become cost-competitive, presenting negotiators with more difficult problems to overcome. The UAW typically has first gone to the company where it believes it could reach the most favorable contract with the least amount of difficulty.\nChrysler, which UAW officials say was less willing to meet their demands, has instead been chosen as the Canadian Auto Workers union's negotiating target. The CAW's Big Three labor contract, covering about 53,000 workers, has been extended until September 17.\n", "Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, part of the giant Deutsche Bank group, has frozen the personal assets of fund manager Peter Young as a probe into suspected irregularities in three of its funds continues.\n\"We have obtained an injunction against Peter Young in order to freeze his assets,\" a spokesman for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche's investment banking arm, told Reuters on Thursday.\nThe injunction was obtained jointly with the Royal Bank of Scotland, trustee for the two funds managed by 38-year-old Young, who has been suspended and was on Wednesday reported to be at his home in Amersham, west of London.\nThe DMG spokesman confirmed a newspaper report that the injunction also covered the assets of a company called Russ Oil &amp; Technology, but declined to give any further details.\nOn Monday trading in three European funds -- the 788 million stg ($1.24 billion) MG European Growth Trust, the 134 million stg MG Europa and 445 million stg Dublin-listed MG European Capital Growth -- was suspended pending investigation.  \nThis is being undertaken unofficially by British investments watchdog IMRO, along with the company, and centres on the valuations of holdings of unquoted and pre-listed (those to be quoted within a year) stocks within the funds.\nWhile few details of the alleged irregularities have emerged, a complex web which includes Swedish crown-denominated warrants in a Canadian mining company and shares in obscure Norwegian firms is beginning to surface.\nThe Financial Times said on Thursday the investigation into the Morgan Grenfell funds followed a Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) examination in April of a London-based broker.\nThis led it to look at the funds managed by Young and it had then made contact with IMRO, which had kept a \"watching brief\" on the funds until last week, the FT added.\nThe funds are due to resume trading on Thursday after Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday it would meet liabilities related to any irregularities that might be identified. The bank also said the prices at which the funds trade should not be hit.\nOn Tuesday it emerged Deutsche Bank had injected between 150 and 200 million stg into the funds, buying some of the securities for its own account to protect investors' interests.  \nDespite this, fund managers say many of the 90,000 investors are expected to bail out of the funds when the suspension on them is lifted because of a loss of confidence. The full scale of the flight from the funds will not be known until later.\nAnalysts have already said that despite Deutsche's attempts to move quickly to limit damage at the British fund management subsidiary, its credibility and earnings are likely to be hit.\nThe impact on the asset management business will only become clear once the extent of investors' reaction is known.\nBut while the problems are confined to only three funds run by Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, the embarrassing and potentially damaging incident comes at a time when Germany's biggest bank is attempting to stamp its authority on the highly competitive world of global investment banking.\nTaking on the tough competition of Wall Street firms in a bid to become a premier global investment house has involved a high-profile, and reportedly costly, recruitment drive to ensure the bank has the top people. At one stage this led to a threat of court action for poaching by rival ING Barings.  \nSome banking sources say Deutsche Bank's own reputation should not be tarnished by investigations into the funds, adding its swift action and the bank's top-rating by credit rating firms should ensure there is little long-term damage.\nBut other firms are unlikely to show the bank any mercy and will do their best to capitalise on its current predicament.  \nStewart Armer, manager of MG Europa Fund was meanwhile suspended from his duties on Wednesday evening following the discovery of a suspected breach of personal account dealing rules. He has been replaced by Julian Johnston, head of the European equities team which includes UK equities.\nTrading in the three European funds was suspending on Monday pending an investigation into possible irregularities, which is being undertaken officially by British investments watchdog IMRO. Last night, MGAM won a High Court injunction freezing the personal assets of fund manager Peter Young.\nWhile few details of the alleged irregularities have emerged, a complex web which includes Swedish crown-denominated warrants in a Canadian mining company and shares in minor, unlisted Norwegian firms is beginning to surface.\nThe Financial Times newspaper said on Thursday that the investigation into the Morgan Grenfell funds followed a Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) examination in April of a London-based broker.\n", "WavePhore Inc., an Arizona company specializing in wireless data transmission, unveiled plans Monday for a service that would use existing television signals to broadcast programming to personal computers.\nThe proposed system, called WaveTop, will allow computer users to bypass bottlenecks in the Internet by enabling them to receive programs broadcast by WavePhore, the company said.\nThe Phoenix-based company said it expected to begin selling its WaveTop service in September.\nThe WaveTop service will broadcast entertainment and information programming nationwide over TV signals, sidestepping the clogged phone lines and overstrained computer networks that slow Internet connections, the company said.\n\"We think we can complement the Internet beautifully,\" said Sandy Goldman, vice president of WavePhore's consumer unit.\nAnalysts consider the system one of a promising new breed of products designed to take advantage of the convergence of personal computers and television technology.\nThe category includes products like WebTV, which differs from WavePhore in that it relies on a phone line and special TV set-top box to provide Internet connections to TV sets.\nWaveTop will initially broadcast stereo music, news, educational childrens programs and new software to home PCs, without interrupting tasks being performed by the computer, the company said.\nOnce it begins U.S. operations in September, WaveTop will be the first wireless data broadcast medium to deliver audio, video, software and real-time data to home personal computers, Goldman said in an interview Friday.\n\"This gets past the bottleneck of the phone line being busy,\" said Gary Arlen, a veteran online industry analyst who heads Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.\nThe system will be free to consumers who own a broadcast-ready personal computer equipped with a TV tuner, a device that several top computer manufacturers plan to include in new machines this year. TV tuners add about $99 to $150 to the cost of a PC, but prices are falling.\nWaveTop would be advertiser-supported but also may offer a pay-per-use option.\nArlen said the system was well suited for transmitting information that did not require instant feedback. \"For a lot of Web surfing, all you need is a way of quickly accessing things that are floating through the wires anyway,\" he said.\nThe WaveTop system operates by embedding data into a portion of existing TV signals. WavePhore has announced a pact to use the Public Broadcasting Service's 250 local stations to broadcast via an unused portion of their signals.\nThe high-speed service will be able to reach more than 99 percent of U.S. television households simultaneously and could eventually be extended to cover Canada over the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s TV network.\n\"It's a network infrastructure that's already in place,\" said Joel Krasner of brokerage firm Southcoast Capital, the one Wall Street analyst who formally follows the company.\n\"You don't have to have people using cable modems or fiber optic cables,\" said Krasner, referring  to other, more costly methods of speeding Internet delivery using phone and cable television technologies.\nWhile WavePhore officials said the company planned to launch an aggressive promotional campaign aimed at the Christmas 1997 selling season, Krasner expected WaveTop to take root only among so-called early adopters this year.\n\"It's a 1998 event,\" Krasner said of chances WaveTop could become a hit consumer electronics product.\nGoldman said the WaveTop network planned to offer one radio station in 1997 and three by 1998, playing a choice of rock, classical and jazz music.\nKidsTop, aimed at children, will deliver educational programming developed by PBS and others, Goldman said.\nFor news, Goldman said the company hoped to negotiate deals with media companies like Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. or Reuters Holdings Plc to offer a slimmed-down version of what WavePhore already offers on its professional investor network.\nHe said WavePhore has few information partnerships to announce, but was in talks with content providers for each of the seven services WaveTop will offer. Goldman said the company expected to sign these deals ahead of the service's September launch.\nThe company noted that a recent study by technology research firm Yankee Group estimated that by the year 2000, nearly 20 million U.S. households will have PCs capable of receiving data embedded in a TV signal.\nWavePhore's strategy has been embraced by computer industry leaders Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which are developing enabling technology of their own to support the integration of home computer and TV technologies.\nWavePhore stock rose 12.5 cents to $9 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.\n", "Hyatt Hotels Corp. said Monday it will spend $1 billion over the next three years to acquire 20 to 30 hotels.\nTarget properties will be upscale hotels and resorts in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean over a three-year period, said Hyatt, which is owned by Chicago's Pritzker family.\nThe company already has made two deals which it says are typical of the expansion plan. Last Friday, a Hyatt affiliate purchased the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, which Hyatt has managed since 1973.\nOn Friday, Chicago-based Hyatt will take over management of the Hotel Nikko Atlanta after acquiring the hotel in partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Partners. The hotel will be renamed the Grand Hyatt Atlanta.\nHyatt's plan was made easier by a recent reorganization of some Pritzker family holdings. The family recently formed Hyatt Equities L.L.C., a real estate acquisition company that consolidates a number of the family's hotel real estate interests into one company, Hyatt said.\nHyatt Equities was created to capitalise on the equity value of the Pritzkers' hotel portfolio, allowing the company to borrow against a collection of assets instead of individual assets at more favourable interest rates.\n\"Hyatt Equities provides an additional vehicle through which we will grow our family's interest in Hyatt hotel real estate, enabling Hyatt to acquire hotels already managed by Hyatt as well as hotels currently managed by other hotel companies,\" Nicholas Pritzker, president of Hyatt Development and Hyatt Equities, said in a news release.\nHyatt Equities debt will be rated by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, and Hyatt's investment bankers anticipate strong investment-grade ratings, said Hyatt, which operates 176 Hyatt hotels and resorts around the world.\nHyatt said that, as a private company, Hyatt Equities is able to use a broader set of transaction structures than is typically available to public companies, real estate investment trusts or acquisition funds.\n\"Hyatt is probably doing this to be defensive,\" said Burland East, analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago, noting that the move comes as other hoteliers, including Host Marriott Corp. and Hilton Hotels Corp., are looking to expand.\nAmong real estate investment trusts that could wind up competing with Hyatt for upscale properties are Dallas-based Patriot American Hospitality Inc. and Phoenix-based Starwood Lodging Trust, East said.\n\"At the margins, 30 hotels is meaningful,\" East said of the impact of Hyatt's plan on the hotel landscape. \"Is it earth-shattering? No.\"\n", "British defence to electronics giant General Electric Company signalled a key shift away from the management legacy of ex-chief Lord Weinstock this week by giving itself a leaner structure, analysts said on Thursday.\nZafar Khan, analyst at SocGen, said \"GEC has created a flatter structure, with divisional heads now reporting to Simpson directly creating a more modern-day business structure. There are more direct lines of control.\"\nGeorge Simpson, who succeeded Weinstock as managing director last September, announced on Wednesday GEC would halve the number of its corporate divisions to five key business units -- GEC Alsthom, GEC Marconi, GPT, GEC USA and the industrial group of businesses.\nThe newly separated industrial group includes the industrial apparatus unit.\nGEC also created a central committee with representatives from the key activities of finance, legal affairs, strategic planning, personnel affairs, marketing and technical issues.\nAnalysts said the move brought GEC's corporate structure up to date and created a leaner and clearer chain of command.\nThe key new change is GEC's decision to group together the main U.S. businesses -- the medical equipment manufacturer Picker International, petrol pump maker Gilbarco and printer maker Videojet.\nOne analyst said the company had informed him that the regrouping did not necessarily mean that industrials was being separated off for sale.\n\"It has indicated that the split in two (of the U.S. and industrials) was due to (former deputy managing director Malcolm) Bates resigning. The strategic review is still six to seven months down the line so GEC is damping down speculation for now,\" he said.\nEven so, market watchers believe that industrial apparatus and consumer electronics are two likely candidates for divestment.\nAndy Crispin at SocGen added that these were businesses with \"low margins and tough markets\" making them sell-off targets.\nGEC finance director David Newlands told Reuters at its half year stage last December that the group had received a spate of offers which were mostly above book value.\nSimpson stamped his first mark on the company at the half year stage by announcing a 160 million pounds ($261.5 million) restructuring charge and the possibility of up to 1,000 job cuts.\nGEC shares have turned more sprightly since Simpson took the helm. The company's shares are approaching a two-year high at 411 pence, up 2-1/2p on Wednesday's close, compared to 271 pence per share in January 1995.\n($1=.6119 Pound)\n", "Britain's motor industry reported 1996 car registrations at a seven-year high on Tuesday, but admitted the figures masked problems of erratic retail sales, poor margins and the threat to exports posed by a surging pound.\nManufacturers faced the double whammy of sluggish domestic retail sales as imports continue to rise, while British exports are now exposed to the new worry of a rising pound.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders put a brave face on car-makers' problems, pointing to 1996 new car registration growth of 4.12 percent on 1995 levels to 2,025,450 -- the third highest annual total on record.\nRegistrations in December showed a monthly rise of 9.23 percent in December. But most of the annual growth was due to company fleet car sales and heavy discounting which has eaten into manufacturers' margins. Retail sales to private British buyers rose by a paltry 2.3 percent on the year.\nWhile the SMMT said 1997 would continue to show some growth, analysts said the industry could not afford to be hit by the stronger pound abroad while the home retail market remains erratic and the fleet car market is artificially boosted by heavy discounting.\n\"We continue to see a rise in imports and while exports did well (in 1996) they are facing tougher times ahead thanks to the pound,\" John Lawson, analyst at Salomon Brothers.\nLawson said car-maker Rover Group, part of Germany's BMW, is the most exposed to sterling strength, with players like Ford Motors and General Motors better placed to switch some capacity or sourcing of components outside Britain if the pound continues to power ahead.\nOn sterling's gains, Ernie Thompson, chief executive of the SMMT, said \"Obviously it's (sterling strength) a risk.\"\nArthur Maher, head of forecasting at analysts LMC International, said \"In the short term, UK exports are likely to impact on company financials rather than sales volumes.\"\n\"If sterling appreciation looks structural, manufacturers may look to reduce vehicle specifications and renew efforts to boost productivity,\" he said.\nThe sales trend in Britain has shown imports rise to take 62.03 percent of the British market, up from 58.94 percent in 1995. In 1994 imports took just 52.82 percent of British car sales. The SMMT said the upward import pattern is set to continue for the next two years.\nAnalysts are also worried that retail sales have not moved in line with the consumer spending binge in other parts of the economy.\nMargaret Pyne, head of economics at the SMMT, said \"The erratic nature of retail demand was particularly disappointing.\"\nCar retail sales did bounce back in the last quarter of 1996, but Maher said \"sales remain vulnerable to a post-election squeeze in 1997, with the retail consumer exposed.\"\nAn election is due by May, with the possibility of a fiscal tightening afterwards which could dampen consumer spending.\nThompson warned that British car makers would continue to feel the pressure with \"intense competition and over-capacity hitting margins. Unless they start earning better profits it is difficult to see how they can afford to finance new models. That is a major concern throughout the world.\"\nAnalysts like Maher said car-makers faced the double bind of cut-throat competition and overcapacity coupled with a more demanding breed of consumer wanting up-to-date innovations at yesterday's prices.\n", "Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Wednesday greeted future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa with a pledge of support, saying the appointment of the tycoon turned chief executive designate marked the dawn of new era.\n\"Of course, I will support him,\" Jiang told reporters during a meeting in Beijing with Tung, who will lead the British colony after it returns to Chinese rule on July 1 next year.\n\"This is indeed the start of a new era,\" he said.\nTung, a shipping magnate who will become Hong Kong's first Chinese chief executive after more than 150 years of colonial rule from London, was in Beijing to meet senior leaders after his formal appointment on Monday by Premier Li Peng.\nThe visit is being keenly watched by residents in the territory eager to know more about Tung's plans for his first post-colonial adminstration and to learn whether current senior civil servants will keep their jobs.\nTung, who has warned Hong Kong's people to be sensitive to China's sovereign rights, has yet to give details of his plans for the post-colonial administration but has said he will discuss transition issues during his Beijing visit.\nHe declined to answer questions from reporters on the position of civil servants before beginning talks with Jiang in Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People.\nIt was Jiang who in January signalled that the tycoon was China's favourite for chief executive by singling him out for a warm, personal handshake at a reception in Beijing.\nA 400-member, Beijing-controlled Selection Committee of Hong Kong residents last week made the choice official when a sweeping 80 percent majority of members backed the 59-year-old tycoon.\nAt a meeting at Beijing's Diaoyutai state guest house, Premier Li Peng gave Tung a certificate of appointment and congratulated him on his success. \"This is indeed an historic moment,\" Li told reporters.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Tung met Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at the guesthouse, but neither he nor Qian made any public comment.\nOne of Tung's first tasks in the twilight of British rule will be to put together an advisory cabinet called the Executive Council and to decide which senior civil servants to keep -- a subject of much speculation among Hong Kong's boisterous media.\nWhile heated interest has focused on Tung's intentions for current senior administrators, China said on Tuesday that it would make the final decision on important civil servants.\n\"For senior officials, they need the nomination of the top administrative official and to finally obtain appointment by the central government,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said at a news briefing.\nChina has hailed Tung's appointment as the fruit of its principle of Hong Kong autonomy, but the selection process was dogged by protests from democrats who accuse Beijing of using its hand-picked committee to stage-manage the choice.\nBeijing's critics believe it is likely try to control Hong Kong and its 6.3 million people from behind the scenes after the five-star Chinese flag is raised over the territory.\nThe Beijing-backed Selection Committee that chose Tung is now preparing for the selection on Saturday of a 60-member, \"provisional legislature\" with which China plans to replace the existing, elected legislature on July 1.\nHong Kong's colonial governor Chris Patten has condemned the new legislature as undemocratic and has vowed not to cooperate with it.\n", "Australia's powerful Maritime Union launched rolling bans on Indonesian shipping on Wednesday to protest against the arrest of Indonesian labour leaders and Canberra's \"failure\" to press Jakarta on human rights.\nThe lightning bans, called at short notice and designed to hold up ships for 24 hours, could apply on an irregular basis to all types of commodity exports to Indonesia, the union said.\nJakarta said the union's move could hurt bilateral ties.\n\"Such kind of incidents are regretted and will harm the efforts to build up relations between the two countries,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl said in Jakarta.\n\"Probably this kind of thing will have the strongest reaction from the business sector who are most affected,\" Fadyl told Reuters. He declined to comment further.\nIndonesia, Australia's nearest Asian neighbour, bought A$2.4 billion (US$1.9 billion) worth of Australian commodities in 1995, covering grains, minerals, livestock and refined petroleum.\n\"The bans are to protest against the recent arrests of independent labour leaders Muchtar Pakpahan and Dita Sari and the continuing repression following the July riots in Jakarta,\" the union said in a statement.\nThe bans were also a response to Australian Prime Minister John Howard's failure in Jakarta this week to press Indonesia on the issue of human rights and democracy, the union said.\nDuring his visit to Indonesia, Howard reaffirmed Australia's commitment to close ties.\nThe first ship to be hit by the rolling bans will be the Bogasari Empat, due to arrive in Fremantle on Australia's west coast late on Wednesday to load 32,500 tonnes of wheat.\nThe ship will load wheat as scheduled but will be delayed for 24 hours before being able to depart, union assistant secretary Vic Slater told Reuters.\n\"It delays things,\" Slater said of the bans. \"In terms of the economy, I don't think it has any effect on the Australian economy.\"\nPakpahan, leader of the Indonesian Labour Welfare Union (SBSI), has been charged with subversion in connection with riots that rocked the Indonesian capital on July 27. The crime of subversion is punishable by death.\nFive people died and 149 were injured in the Jakarta riots, Indonesia's official Human Rights Commission has said. Scores of buildings were set ablaze in the unrest, which was the worst in Jakarta since anti-Japanese riots there in 1974.\nThe riots followed a police raid on the headquarters of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to evict supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, who had been ousted as party leader by a government-backed faction the previous month.\nLabour activist Dita Sari was arrested before the July 27 riots over a labour strike in Surabaya, media reports have said.\nThe Australian rolling bans are in line with a world-wide campaign against Pakpahan's arrest by the International Transport Workers' Federation, which represents more than five million workers in 120 countries, the Maritime Union said.\n\"Muchtar Pakpahan is an independent and moderate union leader who has even won the respect of the U.S. embassy (in Jakarta),\" Slater said.\nU.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord met Pakpahan in his Jakarta cell last Friday.\nThe Maritime Union has 10,000 members working around Australia as seamen and waterside workers.\n", "Japan's securities industry reacted cooly on Thursday to draft proposals by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to speed up the implementation of the government's \"Big Bang\" reform plan.\nAccording to a draft report obtained by Reuters, the LDP's administrative reform panel proposes deregulating 19 financial areas from April, 1998, including abolishing the securities transactions tax and liberalising brokerage commissions on stock transactions.\nThe proposals also call for allowing banks' securities subsidiaries to engage in stock broking business in 1998/99; enabling banks to sell investment trust funds through their branch networks in the same year, and allowing leasing and credit firms to issue commercial paper from 1997/98.\n\"The financial areas in the report cover most areas in which deregulation must be considered,\" said Takashi Kanasaki, a managing director at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd.\n\"But we don't think all the steps and the time tables to implement Big Bang reforms will be decided by the LDP alone as the Finance Ministry is also working out realistic steps to do so,\" he said.\nLast November, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto unveiled a five-year plan to liberalise Japan's financial markets and catch up with reforms carried out more than a decade ago in Europe and North America.\nA special committee of an advisory panel to the Finance Ministry is currently working out measures to realise the Big Bang\" reforms. It will finalise its proposals by June.\nIndustry sources said that the ministry would come up with necessary changes in financial laws by early next year.\nA LDP source said that the report will be a blueprint for discussion among panel members in order to help the government finalise a broader deregulation package by the end of March.\nKanasaki said that he expected brokerage commissions on stock transactions and the securities transaction tax to be deregulated in 1998 as stated in the LDP's draft proposals.\n\"Unless Japan tries to cut trading costs by deregulating such areas as securities transactions tax and commissions next year, we will see a hollowing out of Tokyo financial markets because Japan will liberalise the foreign exchange control system next year,\" he said. \"Local investors will place orders for local stock transactions abroad if costs are cheaper there.\"\nThe cabinet submitted a bill revising the foreign exchange control law to parliament earlier this week. It enables freer cross-border capital transactions and settlements by individuals and corporations from April, 1998.\nYasuyuki Fujita, a senior economist at Nomura Research Institute, said some of the LDP's draft proposals were not realistic.\nHe said discussions would be needed on how to allow banks' securities arms to join the stock broking business, as banks, major holders of Japanese stocks, can influence the corporate decision-making process.\nAnalysts said that it is still difficult to predict who would be the winners after Big Bang, although top commercial banks and brokers are likely candidates.\n\"All financial sectors agree on the general gist of the Big Bang reforms but they expect harsh problems in their business if specific issues are implemented,\" said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre.\n", "Bre-X Minerals Ltd. said Wednesday it would consider merger offers at the right price, but was content for now to develop Busang -- the richest gold discovery this century -- with its existing partners.\n\"The 'For Sale' sign is not on the front yard,\" Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh told analysts in a conference call. \"That is not to rule out discussions with a potential suitor if the price is right. The old expression 'everything has its price' must be taken into account here.\"\nHis comments came after an agreement announced Monday on ownership of the Busang discovery in Indonesia. Under the deal, Bre-X would have 45 percent, with 15 percent to U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., 30 percent to Indonesia's PT Askatindo Karya Minerals and PT Amsya Lyna and partners and 10 percent to the Indonesian government.\nBre-X officials declined to speculate on potential bidders for their Calgary, Alberta-based company, which discovered the 71 million-ounce Busang gold find. Some Bre-X executives said the gold field, which was not yet fully explored, may contain as much as 200 million ounces of gold.\nWalsh said Bre-X, which once owned 90 percent of the deposit, received no cash compensation for giving up a piece of Busang. But he said the Indonesian partners provided \"tangible value\" in developing the site.\n\"This relationship will ensure that things run smoothly. Without a good relationship, things can take years to get processed, and years of hold up for a 4 million ounce a year producer is very, very costly,\" Walsh told Reuters.\nVancouver-based gold miner Placer Dome Inc. said Wednesday its $5 billion offer to merge with Bre-X made before Monday's agreement was no longer feasible because Bre-X was now worth less. But Placer said it remained interested in the project and would like to hold talks with Bre-X.\nWalsh said Bre-X would inform the Indonesian government if it agreed to a merger or sale of its Busang stake. But asked if a deal required government approval, Walsh replied: \"No.\"\nWalsh added that Bre-X's Busang partners did not have rights of first refusal if Bre-X received a third-party offer.\nHe said the Indonesian government indicated it would process contracts of work, known as COWS, for the Busang site as early as possible. \"I do know the government has a wish to process these very, very quickly. So I would not think that we would have to wait very long,\" said Walsh.\nA feasibility study of the project should be completed later in 1997, with construction of the mine expected to begin in 1998. Capital expenditure is estimated at about $1.5 billion.\nProduction was expected to begin in 2000 at a rate of two million ounces annually and climb to four million ounces a year in 2002, said John Felderhoff, Bre-X's senior vice-president of exploration.\nBre-X's latest estimate for the Busang Two area was about 71 million ounces of gold, but Felderhoff said it could be much higher. \"If you would ask me what is the total potential, I would feel very comfortable with 200 million ounces,\" he said.\nBre-X's financial adviser, J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc., said Wednesday it would provide a fairness opinion on the agreement. \"We're very confident it provides very good value to the shareholders of Bre-X,\" said J.P. Morgan's Leslie Morrison, who is advising Bre-X on the deal.\nCanadian newspapers reported Wednesday that Indonesian businessman Jusuf Merukh alleged that the deal with Freeport and the Indonesian interests was illegal and asked Indonesian President Suharto to cancel it.\nMerukh is suing Bre-X for $2 billion in a Canadian court, alleging that his company was entitled to 30 percent of Busang. Bre-X has filed a motion to dismiss the suit. Bre-X topped Toronto Stock Exchange actives Wednesday, gaining C70 cents to C$21.50 on 7.7 million shares after falling sharply Monday and Tuesday on news of the deal.\n", "Shares of Sears, Roebuck and Co, the nation's second largest retailer, fell about six percent Thursday after the company said it will voluntarily refund some payments from credit card holders who filed for bankruptcy.\nSears said the repayments might have a material effect on 1997 earnings. But analysts said the company could not quantify its earnings exposure during a conference call.\nSears stock was down 3-1/8 to 47-3/4.  \nThe dispute is over a process called reaffirmations, where Sears approaches holders of Sears credit cards who have filed for bankruptcy and attempts to have them make payment to Sears rather than having the debt and their Sears credit wiped out in bankruptcy court.\nThe reaffirmation agreements must be filed with a bankruptcy court. Sears said Thursday some of the agreements were not filed properly.\nWhile Sears could not say how much it might have to refund to debtors, the company did say it had $400 million in reaffirmations from 1992 through February 1997, analysts said.  \nAnalysts noted that some of the reaffirmations were properly filed. But Sears may also be subject to other court sanctions.\nThe retailer told analysts it would offer each debtor affected a $100 gift certificate.\nA Sears spokeswoman was not immediately available to confirm analysts' comments.\n\"It (the earnings impact) could end up being $0.50 to $1.00 a share and that's a lot,\" said Peter Schaeffer, analyst at Dillon, Read.  \nAnalysts also said that Sears defined \"material\" as anything over five percent of annual net income. Based on analysts estimates for 1997 earnings, that could mean a minimum cost of about $70 million to 1997 earnings, analysts said.\nBut analysts also said it was too early to say how much impact the credit card problem would have.\n\"They (Sears officials) don't know,\" said Karen Sack, analyst at S &amp; P Equity Group. \"They can't quantify it until they do a full investigation.\"\nThe company also said same store sales rose one percent in March, slightly below expectations.\nBut the credit card problem was what was hurting the stock, analysts said.\n\"Granted, sales were somewhat disappointing,\" said Joseph Ronning, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. \"But this came out of the blue.\"\n((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787))\n", "Fears are rising in Hong Kong that a \"symbolic gesture\" by the Democratic Party early on the territory's first day under China will turn nasty despite the Democrats' commitment to peaceful protest.\nHong Kong's largest party says it will occupy the chamber of parliament, expressing anger at the elected assembly's death as a globally-televised handover ceremony and gala takes place nearby.\n\"I'm really afraid (if) something goes wrong at this time, and it's not anybody's fault,\" said Bob Broadfoot, who manages the think-tank Political and Economic Risk Consultancy.\n\"That would be such a bad thing for Hong Kong right now and who wants that?

The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have combined revenue of 3.0 billion pounds ($4.9 billion), 9 percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million pounds ($678 million) in 1996, with profit margins of 14.1 percent.\n\"These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses, but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require,\" FitzGerald said.\n\"They are essentially industrial businesses selling not to consumers but to intermediate customers. They are very fine businesses,\" he said. \"But if you look at the way this industry is developing, we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business, which is our mainstream consumer goods business.\"\nThe four companies together make up one of the world's largest speciality chemicals groups, employing 15,800 people in more than 35 countries.\nUnilever is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, and its activities span food, personal products, such as Pond's cold cream, and household goods brands, including laundry detergents and Lux soap.\nIn Europe, Unilever's overall results in 1996 were held back by the impact of poor weather on ice cream sales and the impact of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy beef crisis.\n\"We see little reason, however, to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, will improve,\" FitzGerald said.\nGood progress in North American market conditions provided the basis for better results, and the momentum of growth continued strongly in the fast-growing emerging markets.\n", "China is planning major reforms of its government debt markets in 1997 to make them more responsive to market forces and their rates more flexible, officials and analysts said on Tuesday.\nReforms this year will focus on creating a more market-driven secondary market after a series of measures taken last year to improve the primary market, including the introduction of a public tender for setting coupons, they said.\nIn a speech on this year's plans for state debt markets, a senior official said reforms in 1997 will aim to improve coordination between the primary and secondary markets, the Shanghai Securities News said on Tuesday.\n\"We will actively strengthen the role of underwriters as market makers on the secondary market to promote the coordinated development of the primary and secondary markets,\" Deputy Finance Minister Liu Jibin was quoted as saying. Market makers -- major brokerages or securities houses -- would be required to invest consistently in the state debt market and help to stabilise prices when they fluctuate sharply, industry analysts said.\n\"A market maker system and off-floor trading will be introduced in 1997,\" the newspaper on Monday quoted Gao Jian, director of the ministry's state debt department, as saying.\nChina began state debt issues in the early 1980s with purchases made compulsory for many people such as government employees and staff of state-run enterprises.\nBy the early 1990s, purchases of government debt were voluntary, but state-run banks were still forced to underwrite whatever amount they were allocated by the authorities.\nReal market forces did not come into play until 1995 when Beijing for the first time used a public tender system to set the coupon rate on a debt issue.\nThe system was used for all issues in 1996 -- an indication the primary market has been largely freed from administrative control, traders said.\n\"With the changes to the primary market now in place, reforms this year are expected to give more priority to the secondary market,\" said Lu Weiming, a state debt trader with China Guotai Securities.\n\"They are looking at reforms to the secondary market now largely because of the increasingly active trading there after three successive years of record debt issues,\" said a second trader.\nChina issued a record 195.2 billion ($23.52 billion) yuan worth of state debt last year and industry sources expect this year's issues to hit another record of 250 billion yuan.\nIn other reforms, the People's Bank of China at a meeting in Beijing last week ordered commercial banks to withdraw from trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets, traders said.\nThe banks, which have accounted for more than 80 percent of the money supply on the repurchase market alone, have been ordered not to build any new positions and to gradually offset their existing positions.\n\"The state debt market will gradually move to being dominated by securities brokerages as a result of the withdrawal of the commercial banks,\" said a trader with J &amp; A Securities.\nOther significant changes will include more issues of treasury notes and bonds which pay interest on an annual basis instead of on maturity, officials have said.\nThe introduction of state debt paying annual interest will allow Beijing to one day open trading on the annual interest rate to pave the way for a possible start of financial derivatives, industry analysts said.\nChina issued two experimental batches of state debt paying annual interest in 1996.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n", "Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel said on Monday it cut first-half losses and hoped an agreement could be reached soon on a vital bank debt restructuring.\nLosses after interest totalled 3.04 billion francs ($597 million), an improvement of 618 million on the same period in 1995. Since March, Eurotunnel had broken even at the operating level before financial charges and after operating expenses and capital expenditure.\nFrench co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said this proved it was economically viable but needed to lighten the debt burden.\nBut the British and French co-chairmen differed over the timing of the deal which would refinance 72 billion francs of debt and unpaid interest owed to its 225-strong bank syndicate.\nEurotunnel has been in bank talks since it froze payments on its junior-ranked loans a year ago, after it undershot cash targets in 1995. A mandate for two mediators named by a Paris court to help negotiations expires at the end of September.\nPonsolle told reporters here he still hoped for an agreement by the end of September, while his British counterpart, Alistair Morton, told Reuters in London he was allowing eight weeks to reach an accord with bankers.\n\"Our aim is still to reach an agreement on September 30,\" Ponsolle told reporters. He said there was a \"near-consensus\" on the instruments and the structure for the debt-restructuring. But the key question of sharing out the rewards remained.\n\"What is still being discussed is the division of pain and the hope of gains between shareholders and lenders,\" he said. The talks were \"difficult and complex,\" he added.\nMorton said: \"I reckon there's about eight hours of serious negotiation left to do, so I've allowed eight weeks for it. The banks have got plenty of time to get their act together and come to the table,\" he said in a telephone interview.\nMorton, who has said he would resign when the debt talks were over, announced he will step down around end October.\nEurotunnel's talks have been deadlocked over how much banks should get out of cashflow to repay debts and the amount that should go to shareholders who have seen their shares plummet.\nPonsolle said Eurotunnel had always been sold as a long-term investment -- it was floated in 1987 and the first dividend was planned for 2004 -- and it would be unfair if the banks were get the rewards just as it started making money.\nEurotunnel had decided to reward shareholders' patience with discounts on the company's Le Shuttle trains and the Eurostar high-speed rail system, he said.\nStockholders could get 30 percent discounts for three return journeys a year on Le Shuttle and reduced fares on Eurostar.\nEurotunnel was on track for a 50 percent sales increase this year, on its 1995 turnover of 2,266 million francs, despite an expected slowing in sales in the second half of 1996, he said.\nThe company has provisioned 3,710 million francs for interest due on its bank debt but unpaid since it froze payments on September 14, 1995. Its cash position had doubled to 440 million francs from a year ago.\nIt announced August traffic on the Le Shuttle doubled to 304,032 vehicles compared to 145,861 a year ago. Eurostar carried 566,247 people in August, compared to 279,449.\nPonsolle said a decision on its claim against the TransManche Link building consortium could be made early in 1997. The earliest date a shareholders meeting could be convened to vote on a debt accord would also be in the new year.\nMorton will be succeeded by Robert Malpas, chairman of Cookson, a British specialist materials manufacturer.\n", "China's crown rests uneasily on the head of Deng Xiaoping's anointed successor, Jiang Zemin.\nDeng's death after an 18-year rule opens the door to a power struggle in the communist political elite, throwing into relief Deng's major failure -- his inability to set in place a firm succession structure.\nMany diplomats and political analysts said they expected Jiang to tighten his grip on the top job after seven years building a powerbase under the wing of his patron.\nBut the absence of a proper structure and the removal of his mentor leaves him exposed in one of the most precarious positions in the world.\n\"With Deng's death the political ring of confidence that so protected Jiang Zemin has been torn asunder and he must now face an uncertain political future and political ills by himself,\" said Australian sinologist Geremie Barme.\nDeng was the last leader of China's communist era who could back his claim with an impeccable revolutionary pedigree -- a founder of socialist rule, a victorious veteran of the Long March and battles that swept the Communist Party to power and a colleague of Chairman Mao Zedong.\nJiang's resume is not so impressive.\nBut, aware of his weakness, he has devoted much of his time to building up his powerbase -- particularly in the military -- after his two predecessors were purged following student demonstrations.\nHe has amassed the positions of party boss, state president and head of the armed forces.\n\"Jiang Zemin is a student of Chinese history and Chinese politics and he is very clear that the military hold the key to political power. As the Mao Zedong dictum said, 'political power comes from the barrel of the gun',\" said Hong Kong-based analyst Tai Ming Cheung.\nBut, he said, the military's support is not unqualified and Jiang will have to \"provide additional finances and allow the military an important say\".\nBarme said Jiang's capture of China's three top jobs was unprecedented in the 20th century -- but also dangerous because he was now the only real target for a takeover bid.\nDiplomats and analysts said that while Jiang appeared comfortable in the immediate aftermath to Deng's death, he could not afford to be complacent.\n\"There is a lot of horse trading that has already been taking place, and with Deng's passing it complicates matters a little, perhaps not significantly,\" said Cheung.\nBut Jiang was now facing the real test of his career, and of Deng's succession plans, diplomats said.\n\"It has been Jiang Zemin's good fortune that Deng Xiaoping lasted this long,\" said one Western diplomat.\n", "China on Tuesday introduced rules governing direct shipping links with Taiwan, ignoring a decades-old ban by the island it regards as a renegade province.\nThe regulations, which take effect from Tuesday, allow only wholly Chinese-owned or Taiwan-owned shipping companies or joint ventures involving Chinese or Taiwanese shipowners to sail between the two sides, Xinhua news agency said.\nHong Kong's Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po newspaper said the southeastern Chinese cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou would be the first ports to be opened to direct shipping links with Taiwan.\n\"The conditions for (establishing) direct shipping links are ripe,\" the newspaper said.\nTaiwan's Nationalist government has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops lost the Chinese civil war to the communists and fled to the island.\nWith tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in a third country or territory such as the British colony of Hong Kong or Portuguese-run Macau.  \nTaiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct transport links, but Taiwanese authorities have been reluctant to lift the ban.\nThe Nationalists, who say they are committed to reunification with China, see direct transport links as their last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nChina has threatened to invade if the island seeks independence.\nUnder the regulations, shipping companies must apply with the Chinese Ministry of Communications for permission to ply routes between the two sides. The rules made no mention of any need to seek approval from Taiwan authorities.\nThe ministry has 45 days to decide whether to allow a shipping company to sail between the two sides, according to the regulations.\nThe rules empower the ministry to warn and seize the unlawful income of shipping companies breaking the rules.\nChina has poured cold water on a proposal by Taipei to turn Taiwan's Kaohsiung into an extraterritorial port, allowing third party ships to ply routes between the two sides.  \nThe Taipei-based Economic Daily News said on Tuesday Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui had urged the central bank to study how to control capital outflows to China in a further bid to limit the island's economic exposure on its main rival's turf. The central bank denied the report.\nSpeculation that Taipei might change its China policy has mounted since Lee cautioned last week that the island's economy needed to avoid over-dependence on the mainland.\n\"The Chinese are not really making much progress on other fronts... They have decided to focus on the three links and apply pressure on the Taiwanese,\" a Western diplomat in Beijing said. The three links refer to trade, transport and mail.\nOn the diplomatic front, the rivalry has intensified, analysts say, with China trying hard to isolate the island and limit its contacts with other states.\nTaiwan state-funded television said Vice-President Lien Chan was visiting the former Soviet republic of Ukraine,  which formally recognises Beijing. The Ukraine has denied the report.\nChina announced a diplomatic coup on Monday, persuading the West African nation of Niger to switch recognition to Beijing.\n", "Nearly eight million members of Britain's largest mortgage lender, the Halifax Building Society, are in-line to pocket hundreds of pounds more than originally expected when it floats on the London stock market on June 2.\nIf betting at London financial bookmakers is near the mark, the basic handout of 200 shares will be worth around 1,400 pounds ($2,270), way ahead of predictions when the flotation was first announced.\nThe average payout would be 2,170 pounds, nearly 900 pounds more than the Halifax's initial forecasts in January.\nBookmakers, City Index and IG Index, are quoting the Halifax closing price on its first day of trading at 695-705 pence.\nThat would value the group which converts to a bank on flotation at over 17-1/2 billion pounds and rank it among Britain's largest dozen companies.\nIn January, the Halifax estimated the shares would be priced at between 390 and 450 pence and in April put a 415 pence 'floor' value on the shares sold on flotation through its free dealing service.\n\"We opened the Halifax at 660 to 670 pence yesterday. It was very difficult to find people to sell it at that price and it looks as though it's going to be dragged a bit higher,\" said IG Index's Peter Hetherington.\nAround two-thirds of Halifax members will receive the basic 200 shares windfall. Members will receive additional shares based on the level of savings.\nThe maximum allocation for those who can claim for a mortgage account and savings account will now be worth just under 10,000 pounds.\nForecasts of the size of handout have risen steadily since the original announcement of the flotation.\nA downward revision in the number of qualifying members gave an initial boost to the figure and the performance of financial stocks since has helped drag the price higher.\nThe success of the Alliance and Leicester flotation in April has added to expectations of strong demand for Halifax shares. Alliance shares rose sharply on the first days of trading as institutional investors scrambled for stock.\nThat experience and the subsequent strength of the shares is likely to tempt many Halifax members to hold onto their handouts, at least initially.\n\"On fundamentals it's unlikely it's worth seven pounds but built into that price is a big chunk of scarcity premium,\" said one banking analyst.\n\"The concern is that there isn't going to be a lot of supply around and whatever there is will come out largely in one auction.

Then you get YUKOS (Russia's second largest oil producer) saying, 'What about us?'\"\nSergei Pavlenko of the Moscow-based Centre for Economic Reform said Norilsk's ability to find 900 billion roubles for overdue salaries depended less on its main shareholder Uneximbank's cash in hand and more on regional budget politics.\n\"Restructuring Norilsk is not so much a question of cash as of budget politics,\" he said, adding Norilsk was trying to force its administrative district, the vast Krasnoyarsk region, to shoulder the cost of supporting social infrastructure and other non-metals industries.\nA Western fund manager in Moscow who follows Norilsk said he thought a government decree restructuring Norilsk tax and budget arrears was likely, given the strategic importance of Norilsk's nickel and precious metals exports to the economy .\nKey to Norilsk's efforts to boost revenues and pay off arrears is a plan to transfer the huge cost of social infrastructure in its Arctic towns to the regions.\nNorilsk supports 60 percent of the regional budget of Krasnoyarsk, which runs from the Arctic down to the southern Siberian steppes. It says it cannot support the region's farmers and other workers.\nBut many analysts do not expect fast government aid for Norilsk, which in addition to two to three months in back salaries owes 1.2 trillion roubles to various budgets -- a burden it says has cut into wage payments.\nNorilsk says it spent nearly 42 percent of its 1996 revenues on social costs.\nWhile Norilsk's main shareholder commercial bank Uneximbank is well connected -- First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin is the bank's former head -- it is only one of many powerful Russian firms in need of state handouts.\n\"To pay for transferring social costs, the regions will have to raise taxes -- and that is going to be paid for by the company,\" said the Western economist.\nWestern traders are sceptical of serious supply disruptions at Norilsk, but they are not discounting the possibility that a protracted financial crisis and arrears could affect output at one of the world's biggest nickel and precious metals producers.\nBut Pavlenko said no Russian industrial strike in recent history had ever cut into output significantly.\n\"Russian workers know how to do one thing -- work,\" he said, adding, \"The Norilsk trade union is multifaceted and complex.\"\nOther analysts said they doubted a serious strike would materialise while debt restructuring was being carried out.\n\"I think people are seeing the seeds of a solution there,\" said Grant Sinitsyn, metals equity analyst at United City Bank in Moscow.\n\"It's been a lot of posturing on the part of the union.

But most companies' revenues come in U.S. dollars, the currency in which most metals trade.\n\"Currency gets full-time attention here,\" said Alan Thomas, chief financial officer of Noranda Inc..\nA change of one U.S. cent in the Canadian dollar translates into C$20 million ($14.8 million) on Noranda's bottom line, Thomas said. The currency rose about three quarters of a U.S. cent in 1996, costing Noranda about C$15 million ($11.1 million), he said.\n\"So for '96, there's not a big change. But if the dollar continues to go up, it will have a bigger effect,\" he said.\n\"All our costs are in Canadian dollars -- the salaries we pay, the supplies we buy, the rent we pay. All our products are priced in U.S. dollars and they're priced the same regardless of the exchange rate,\" Thomas said\nCompanies such as Alcan Aluminium Ltd., with most production outside Canada, are not as exposed to harm from a stronger currency since they pay most of their operating costs in U.S. dollars, analysts said.\nBut for companies such as Inco Ltd. and Falconbridge Ltd. that produce most of their nickel in Canada, a stronger dollar will take its toll.\nFalconbridge figures a one-cent change in the Canadian dollar would knock C$7 million ($5.2 million) off its bottom line, even with the company's substantial currency hedging program.\nWhile Falconbridge operations in the Dominican Republic and Norway would not be affected by a stronger Canadian currency, about two-thirds of the company's operating costs originate in Canada, said Chief Financial Officer Lars-Eric Johansson.\nInco estimated that every one-cent change in the Canadian dollar amounted to a $9 million (corrects from $13 million) pre-tax hit despite currency hedging. But the company earned $179 million in 1996 on revenues of $3.1 billion, so small movements in the Canadian dollar do not have a huge effect, said Inco Chief Financial Officer Tony Munday.\n\"It's not going to kill us,\" he said.\nStill, some mining analysts said the effects of a stronger Canadian dollar needed to be understood in context.\n\"With a rising dollar, it usually means metal prices are going up as well,\" said base metal analyst David Davidson with CIBC Wood Gundy in Toronto.\n", "Shares in British supermarkets fell on Monday after a study said they were closer to a price war than they have been for 15 years.\nBut analysts remain sceptical that stores will risk such a move, and supermarkets themselves appeared reluctant to sacrifice their profit margins.\nThe study by research group Verdict adding to market worries after J.

London.\nIvory Coast produced a record 1.2 million tonnes of cocoa in 1995/96 and originally predicted 950,000 tonnes for this year before Gauze said in March only 800,000 would be exported -- partly due to increased local processing.\nFour factories with a (bean) capacity rising to 180,000 tonnes in late 1997 are already operating in Ivory Coast.\nIndustry sources say over 130,000 tonnes of beans

communications systems and networks and telecommunications equipment, said revenues for its fiscal second quarter grew by 12.5 percent to $5.15 billion from $4.58 billion.\nLucent said it benefited from strengthened relationships with the regional Bell companies that followed its spin-off from AT&amp;T a year ago.\nPreviously, local phone companies had been reluctant to do business with the AT&amp;T equipment unit, seeing AT&amp;T as a potential rival in the coming era of open competition for local and long-distance services.\nOf Lucent's four main businesses, only consumer products suffered a decline in revenues for the quarter, which was expected, the company said.\n\"We're delighted to report double-digit revenue growth and a dramatic quarter-over-quarter rise in profits as we complete our first year as a public company,\" Chairman Henry Schacht said in a statement.\n\"Our strong U.S. and international sales to network operators, businesses and microelectronics customers position us well to take maximum advantage of the exploding communications technology market.\"\nThe company, based in Murray Hill, N.J., said its gross profit margin for the quarter rose to 42.1 percent of revenues from 39.9 percent, due primarily to higher sales volume and productivity improvements.\nLucent said its revenues from systems for network operators increased 23.3 percent to $2.93 billion. Revenues for microelectronic products increased 18.3 percent to $615 million and revenues for business communications systems increased 14.1 percent to $1.308 billion.\nRevenues from consumer products decreased 41 percent to $174 million as a result of continuing reengineering of the business to increase profitability, Lucent said.\nThe company said the decrease was expected following the closing of its phone centre stores, the streamlining of its product line and expected reductions in phone rentals.\nLucent said continuing demand for second telephone lines in businesses and residences for uses such as Internet access, data traffic and fax services contributed to solid gains in sales of wireless systems, switching systems and related software.\nChief Financial Officer Don Peterson said the company expects its lagging consumer products unit -- the smallest of four product divsions -- to show substantial profit gains in 1997 and a return to revenue growth by the December quarter.\n\"We expect a substantial improvement in profitablity this year (for the unit) mainly through cost-cutting, and positive revenue growth\" due to new products, he said.\nLucent's stock closed at $54.125, down 50 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "The Busang gold mystery may be solved by late next week, Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. said on Friday, amid reports that its major partner may soon abandon the controversial project.\nBre-X said in a statement that Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., the consulting firm hired by Bre-X to audit its Busang project, expected to issue an interim report on its findings by the end of next week.\nRumors have swirled around Busang since the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. said its preliminary tests found \"insignificant\" amounts of gold.\nPanic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) or 80 percent from the company's stock market value. Since then investors have anxiously awaited Strathcona's findings.\n\"Upon receiving and reviewing the interim report, Bre-X will be promptly issuing a press release relating to the interim report,\" Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh said.\nConfusion over Bre-X's announcement on Friday sparked a brief bout of heavy selling on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Bre-X sank to a session low of C$2.50, but recovered to finish down C35 cents at C$3.25 on 8.9 million shares.\nFreeport's annual meeting next week was also expected to draw intense media and investor attention, analysts said.\nCiting unidentified sources, Indonesia's Harian Ekonomi Neraca newspaper on Friday said Freeport was planning to pull out of Busang before Strathcona's results were released.\n\"At best, this way Freeport can avoid any possible (legal) suit that may arise. And this (suit) is quite possible \" the anonymous source told Neraca.\nFreeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Friday the firm had no comment beyond its earlier statements on participating in the Busang project.\n\"We're not going to comment. We will elect to participate only if the development is economically feasible,\" she said in a telephone interview.\nFreeport's annual meeting is on Tuesday, April 29 in New Orleans.\nBre-X has a 45 percent stake in Busang, Freeport has 15 percent, the Indonesian government 10 percent and local companies the remaining 30 percent.\nThe Neraca report had little impact on Freeport's stock, which closed down 25 cents at $28.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. But some analysts said the report was interesting.\n\"My sense is there may be a kernel of truth in it,\" one U.S. mining analyst said of the Neraca report, noting other reports this week that Freeport Chief Executive Jim Moffett met with Indonesian President Suharto on a recent visit to Indonesia.\nFreeport has not confirmed or denied these reports, saying it does not release specific travel plans of its officials.\nThe analyst also said that several days before Freeport's statement on March 26, Neraca cited unidentified sources as saying that Freeport did not get the same Busang results as Bre-X.\nA Canadian analyst said Bre-X investors were divided into two camps heading into next week.\n\"One group thinks there is very little chance that the gold is anywhere near the amounts that Bre-X stated and the other group is firmly entrenched that this is all a grand conspiracy,\" the analyst said.\nMeanwhile, Strathcona has promised tight security to prevent its findings from leaking out.\nAssay labs in Indonesia, Canada and Australia will not report their results to Strathcona until all the labs have completed their work. Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory will have access to the final assays, Strathcona said.\nThe principal conclusions in the interim report are not expected to change when Strathcona releases its full report six weeks later.\n", "The Justice Department is investigating possible bid-rigging during airwaves auctions held by the federal government for wireless phone licenses.\nJustice Department documents obtained by Reuters Wednesday showed the department's antitrust division also was looking into whether bidders schemed illegally to divvy up the licenses being sold.\nThe Federal Communications Commission has raised more than $20 billion since 1995 by selling licenses to companies offering a new generation of cellular phone service known as \"personal communications services,\" or PCS.\nA Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the investigation. She said the antitrust division was \"looking into the possibility of anti-competitive conduct by bidders in connection with the FCC's auctioning of spectrum for PCS.\"\nShe declined to specify which auctions were being investigated or provide additional details.\nThe department documents focus on the PCS auction that ended in mid-January and raised $2.5 billion.\nAt that auction, the FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making it the most licenses sold at once. A third of the licenses were reserved for small companies.\nTop bidders were units of Sprint Corp., AT&amp;T Corp. and BellSouth Corp.\nA spokesman for BellSouth said the company had not been informed by the government of any investigation. It was not immediately known whether the other two companies were targets or had been contacted regarding the probe.\nAn attorney familiar with the investigation said the department has sent out \"numerous\" letters requesting information and documents from auction participants.\nThe \"civil investigative demand\" seeks information about companies' bids, their bidding strategies and communications about the auction with other telecommunications firms.\nIn a sign that the investigation was looking into the possibility of bid \"signaling\" among participants, the department requested documents showing the last three digits of company bids.\nOne attorney familiar with the investigation said it was evident during the bidding that companies used the last three digits of their dollar bidding figure to signal their intentions to other auction participants.\n\"It's clear a certain amount of this was taking place,\" said the attorney, who spoke on condition of not being identified.\n", "The Czech crown fell sharply on Thursday following central bank comments that it was not satisfied with the currency's recent rise, but dealers said the crown remains attractive and should stabilise by week's end.\nOne of post-Communist Europe's most stable currencies, the crown has consistently reached record highs in recent weeks, fuelled by demand brought about from a wave of more than 30 billion crowns in Eurobond issues since the start of the year.\nBut while the crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket trading at 3.48 percent above parity, it was down over 60 basis points from its opening and some 200 points lower from Tuesday's record fixing at +5.51.\nAnalysts said, however, that the country's high interest rate differential and the country's overall economic stability should limit any further drop.\n\"For this week, we may see the crown slightly weaker, but the crown is still very attractive and I do not see space for much furthening weaking of it,\" said Jiri Becvar of BNP-Dresdner in Prague.\nThe central bank's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent, while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June.\nThe fall comes on the heels of Wednesday's comment by the central bank it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary.\n\"Intervention (on the market) is our normal instrument, and we can use it whenever we are not satisfied (with the crown's exchange rate),\" CNB spokesman Martin Svehla told Reuters.\n\"The other question is whether we are satisfied? You heard (CNB) governor (Josef Tosovsky) saying there is 'no reason' for the crown to be like this. It signals that the central bank is not fully satisfied with this development,\" he added.\nHe declined to elaborate, and said these were just \"general\" comments.\nBreta Tichanek of ING Barings said he expected the crown to trade within the range plus four to plus five percent from the basket midpoint throughout the day.\n\"I think it's partially because of yesterday's comment (by the CNB) and the closing of some postions and speculative flows,\" he said.\nThe depth of the fall also took the market by surprise initially, with many dealers saying they had been prepared for an early attack on +4.25 percent, but expected London dealers to take profits and then stabilise.\n\"In fact there were new buyers after some brief consolidation and the index dropped to +3.45,\" said Petr Korous of CSOB.\n\"There are a lot of long positions and they have to be covered so the market may squeeze them. If there is nothing special I am very sceptical that we can see the crown index weaken much more than to around +3.00,\" he added.\nSome crown dealers have said the central bank had been putting out feelers in the market recently, though most did not expect to see any intervention, especially after the weakening on Thursday.\nThe CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent.\n", "British water company Wessex Water turned in a 10 percent rise in half year pretax profits on Tuesday and raised its dividend by 14 percent.\n\"We are actively pursuing other options that will deliver higher returns to our shareholders,\" the company said in a statement.\nWessex said pretax profits for the six months ending September 30 rose to 75.5 million pounds ($127.2 million) from 68.4 million previously.\nThe company declared a dividend of 5.7 pence a share, but Wessex stock slipped three pence to 351 pence as the market registered its disappointment that the company had not handed out the promised extra benefits immediately.\n\"The shares have fallen on the lack of any shareholder benefits,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named.\nWessex' balance sheet has net cash of 75 million pounds and analysts had looked for greater shareholder benefits after a planned bid for South West Water was blocked by the government in October along with a rival proposal from Severn Trent.\n\"We are not going to sit with that ungeared balance sheet,\" chief executive Colin Skellett said in an interview.\nHe said Wessex would announce its plans, which could range from an acquisition to a share buyback or a mix of moves in the the next six months.\nSkellet said any potential acquisitions would be \"relevant to our business...we are not going to go into anything that we do not understand.\"\nHe said Wessex was doing two things well -- its regulated water supply business and its non-regulated waste management firm UK Waste, a joint venture with Waste Management International.\nSkellett said some 20-30 jobs would be cut at a senior level, with a knock-on effect for the rest of the company, as a result of the aborted bid for South West Water helping to cut operational costs.\nThese costs were cut four percent at the water business in the first six months and should maintain that momentum for the second half, Wessex said.\nLower waste paper and cardboard prices in the first half bit into UK Waste's turnover to the tune of three million pounds. But Wessex said the unit continued to make a growing contribution to its overall results, with profits of 12.4 million pounds.\nSkellett said the fall in prices appeared to be halting and the underlying business was growing well.\nWessex said it would be consulting with customers in order to direct investment in line with their choices.\nOne of the first findings was that 90 percent of customers wanted service improvements rather than short-term price cuts. $1=.5936 Pound)\n", "AT&amp;T Corp. is earning more, but having trouble getting paid.\nThe nation's largest telephone company said Wednesday that operating profits from continuing operations for the last quarter of 1996 rose 14 percent, but said it had to put aside $200 million to cover unpaid bills by customers.\nThe telecommunications company, which has now completed its split into three major units, said it earned $1.24 billion, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $1.09 billion, or 68 cents a share, in 1995's last quarter.\nChief financial officer Richard Miller told Wall Street analysts in a conference call that results for the first quarter of 1997 would be comparable or slightly above those of the fourth quarter.\nRevenues in the latest period rose to $13.24 billion from $12.89 billion.\nThe Basking-Ridge, N.J.-based company's 1995 fourth-quarter operating profits excluded restructuring and other charges totalling $2.036 billion, or $1.27 a share. Including these charges, its net earnings from continuing operations resulted in a loss of $948 million, or 59 cents a share.\nCompetition has brought the company a new headache.\n\"It used to be if you don't pay your phone bill you didn't get phone service. Now with multiple suppliers, we can shut off their service, but they can go someplace else to get service,\" Miller told Reuters.\nThe problem is worst among business users, particularly the hundreds of tiny long-distance resellers, some of whom go bankrupt after ordering millions of network minutes from carriers like AT&amp;T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. in order to compete with them.\nAT&amp;T's fourth-quarter operating net per share was three cents below the 79 cents industry analysts had forecast, according to First Call, mainly on the extra $200 million in provisions for bad debts.\nAs a result, some analysts lowered their 1997 estimates.\n\"No one was expecting that,\" said Bear Stearns analyst Bette Massick. \"You have to cut your number on that alone.\"\nFor all of 1996, AT&amp;T's income from continuing operations rose to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion for 1995, excluding the charges. Earnings per share for 1996 were $3.47, a 5.5 percent increase over $3.29 per share in 1995.\nTotal 1996 revenues were $52.2 billion, a 3 percent increase over 1995's $50.7 billion.\n\"AT&amp;T had a record year in 1996 in the face of extraordinary challenges and unprecedented changes in our business and in our industry,\" said Chairman Robert E. Allen.\nIn September 1995, AT&amp;T said it would restructure its businesses, spinning off equipment company Lucent Technologies in September, and it completed with the spinoff of computer company NCR at the end of 1996.\nAT&amp;T also sold its majority position in AT&amp;T Capital Corporation to a consortium of investors during the year.\nAT&amp;T said its communications services revenue increased $529 million in the latest quarter, up 4.3 percent from the same period last year. Communications services revenues include wireline services and wireless services, as well as communications products and other services.\nIt said its long-distance calling volumes grew 6 percent over the same period in 1995 and 1.8 percent over the previous quarter.\n\"The growth in traffic volumes (3.2 percent) was better than the 2.5 percent we were expecting,\" said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. \"But they are still losing market share to the tune of three percentage points a year,\" he said.\nAT&amp;T's wireless services revenue, which includes cellular voice and data, messaging and air-to-ground services, grew 18.4 percent to $937 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. Its cellular service subscribers grew to 5.2 million, a 31.7 percent increase from a year ago.\nRevenues from communications products and other services, which include consulting and outsourcing, on-line, and wireless product sales, were $386 million, an increase of nearly 17 percent from the year-ago quarter.\nHowever, credit card revenue plunged 32.3 percent to $374 million, primarily as a result of the securitization programme instituted at AT&amp;T Universal Card Services in 1995.\nCredit card operating losses fell to $4 million in the fourth quarter from $35 million in the third quarter of 1996. In 1995's fourth quarter, it made an operating profit of $109 million.\nAT&amp;T's stock closed 50 cents down at $38.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday raided the country's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co. Ltd, in a dramatic sign of a widening probe into its part in payments to a client linked to racketeers.\nThe late afternoon raid on Nomura headquarters in central Tokyo was by both prosecutors and officials of the nation's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission.\nThe highly public raids, including tipoffs to the media that they were imminent, appeared to signal that the Nomura incident could become a showcase as Japan seeks to clean up business practices and deregulate its economy.\nCoinciding with the headquarters raid, another 90 officials swooped on 10 other locations and for the first time formally spelled out in detail what they were investigating.\nDeputy chief prosecutor Kunihiro Matsuo told reporters the raids were to investigate a Nomura director's illegal payment of 38 million yen ($309,000) to a company run by a relative of a racketeer to avoid disruption of a Nomura annual meeting.\nMatsuo said the other raids included searches of the homes of the racketeer and the Nomura director involved in the scandal, Shimpei Matsuki.\nThe scandal surfaced on March 6 and Matsuki and fellow director Nobutaka Fujikura resigned on March 10 after internal probes found they made discretionary deals banned under Japanese law and funnelled profits to a front company for the racketeer.\nThe \"sokaiya\" racketeers, often linked to \"yakuza\" crime syndicates, extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called \"sokai\" in Japanese.\nNomura President Hideo Sakamaki stepped down on March 14 to atone for the scandal. He became an adviser to the company, and Chairman Masashi Suzuki took over his position while retaining the chairmanship.\nNomura, one of the world's most powerful financial institutions, is involved in bond and share trading. It exerts a powerful influence on every business in the yen bond market and is also Japan's top foreign bond seller.\nThe company has seen key foreign and domestic clients suspend business with it since the scandal broke.\nNomura has been a key player in Japanese financial markets for most of this century, and has underwritten firms such as Sony Corp., which were part of Japan's postwar economic miracle.\nIn a scene akin to a Japanese film, 90 officials in business suits, led by a man with a briefcase, marched military-style through the front doors of Nomura's modernistic headquarters.\nThey firmly locked the doors, shutting out reporters who gathered to witness the raid, which was designed to have maximum publicity value.\nReports that the raids were imminent hit Nomura's stock, which ended the day down 20 yen (16 cents) at 1,440 ($11.70).\nBut brokers said the impact of the news was limited as the market had expected such a development.\n\"What the market is more concerned about is any punitive measures which will be taken against the brokerage,\" said Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager.\n\"The punishment will probably have an effect on the firm's business and could have an impact on the whole brokerage industry as well,\" Ueki said.\nThe investigation comes six years after Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients.\nTop executives at Nomura resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters.\n", "A widespread shake-up is hitting the highly competitive funds management industry, stripping a number of Hong Kong's key players of their jobs.\n\"The whole industry is in turmoil at the moment,\" said Christopher Day, formerly of Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd.\nDay left Thornton in the wake of its amalgamation last November into the other fund units of Dresdner Bank, including RCM Capital and Kleinwort Benson Investment.\nHe is one of at least four senior dismissals during the past few weeks, according to industry sources. All were the result of consolidation in the industry with finance houses scrambling for position in the exploding mass market for retail mutual and pension funds.\n\"A number of companies want to become the Proctor &amp; Gamble of fund management,\" Day said. \"Virtually every European bank thinks it'll play in this market.\"\nBig financial companies are merging, seeking distribution networks powerful enough to gain dominance in this sector. The best example was Morgan Stanley Group Inc's US$10.7 billion merger with Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co last February, he said.\n\"Dean Witter is a distributor, although it may not be called that,\" Day said. \"Branding and distribution are the key. Marks &amp; Spencer sells mutual funds, so does Virgin \"\nBanks are keenly interested in funds management because they want to shift income away from loans to investment management income, which they perceive as higher quality, said another senior industry figure who was about to leave his company.\n\"And there's growing income from fund management where on the loan side you increase profits by driving volume,\" he said.\nBut he warned that banking and funds management do not necessarily blend well due to a difference in cultures.\n\"A loan-driven bank in Europe just does not have the entrepreneurial flair to drive fund management volumes, and in banks, nobody has any skill to manage these egotists,\" he said.\nThis sort of culture clash could jeopardise compliance, he warned. Fund managers, often seen as unmanageable by the more conservative banks, end up being left alone while compliance officers -- usually lawyers -- have a poor understanding of the fund industry.\nSome fund managers also said they were becoming uncomfortable in the new supermarket-style fund houses, and this was one factor that accounted for a mushrooming of niche operations.\nFund managers were under pressure to design mass market products and have assumed more of a marketing role to adapt to an increasing focus on the consumer.\n\"Small boutiques are rising up full of people (fed) up with the large houses,\" said the second fund manager\nThe boutiques seem to function well. Joseph Paul, customer service manager at Rothschild Asset Management Asia Pacific, said his group has little interest in the high-turnover, mass market best exemplified by Jardine Fleming Unit Trusts in Hong Kong. But Rothschild proved that even niche players are not immune to fall-out from this industry shake-up.\nIn late 1995, Rothschild lost its entire funds management team to National Westminster Bank, which merged one of its units with Wheelock and Co Ltd\nThe merger folded last November, with NatWest buying out Wheelock's stake, partly because NatWest had sealed a deal with huge British pension giant Gartmore Plc\n-- Hong Kong Newsroom (2843 6470)\n", "The chairman of ITT Corp has rejected an offer to meet the top executive of Hilton Hotels Corp, which last week launched a $6.5 billion hostile takeover of the hotel, casino and entertainment giant, sources close to the companies said.\nIn a letter faxed to Hilton chairman Stephen Bollenbach on Saturday, ITT chairman Rand Araskog said it would be inappropriate for the executives to meet or for Bollenbach to address the ITT board on Tuesday as he had requested, the sources said.\nThe sources described Araskog's letter as brief and formal.\nAn ITT spokesman declined to comment and a Hilton spokesman in Los Angeles could not be immediately reached for comment.\nBollenbach's request to ITT was disclosed in a January 31 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nHilton, which is trying to buy ITT in a cash and stock deal valued at $55 per share, formally launched a hostile takeover of ITT on Friday. Hilton also has proposed acquiring about $4 billion of ITT debt for a total transaction worth $10.5 billion.  \nWall Street experts widely expect ITT to reject the offer, which is considered to be too low. Although its stock has declined sharply in recent months, most experts estimate ITT is worth at least $65 per share.\nITT's advisers have spent the past few days poring over the formal bid filed with the SEC on Friday. The advisers are expected to present an in-depth analysis of the offer when ITT holds a regularly scheduled board meeting on Tuesday.\nThe ITT board, which has until February 14 to respond to the Hilton offer, is not expected to make a decision at the Tuesday meeting.\nSources close to ITT told Reuters that the analysis was likely to focus on Hilton's proposed financing for the transaction and a preliminary agreement with HFS Inc to license the Sheraton franchise. Hilton, which has estimated it will need about $3.5 billion to buy ITT, said its offer is not conditioned on obtaining financing.\nHilton has estimated the proposed union would generate more than $100 million in cost savings.\nHilton also has said that while it would prefer to negotiate a transaction with ITT, it would be prepared to launch a proxy fight to replace the ITT board of directors.\n", "In China's headlong rush to develop, first in its fanatical leftwing past and then in the get-rich-quick days of reform, it has hacked or bulldozed away much of its architectural heritage.\nGraceful old courtyards of Beijing have fallen victim to the development onslaught in recent years, crumbling alongside one of the earliest casualties -- the once majestic Beijing city wall.\nBuilt to ward off invaders centuries ago, the wall was unable to withstand the inroads of its own people bent on discarding what was considered out of date.\nBut China's capital is trying to make amends for some of its past excesses by restoring a small portion of the wall that encircled the city until it was dismantled in the years after the communist takeover in 1949.\nResidents of Beijing have been answering a public call to return city wall bricks to help rebuild a small section of the structure.\nBricks once buried in courtyards, kept as household ornaments or used as building materials have been handed over to a group restoring the wall under the direction of the Beijing city government.\n\"We hope to have about 115 metres of the wall restored this year,\" said Li Yancheng of the Beijing Historical Relics Construction Co of the municipal government.\nMING DYNASTY KILNS\nSome 30,000 bricks from the old wall have been donated to the project and now sit stacked on a city lot where they will be used in the restoration effort.\nWorkers chip off hardened soil, revealing the names of Ming dynasty kilns (1368-1644 A.D.) where the bricks were fired.\n\"As a child I remember helping take down part of the wall,\" said Li. \"Adults were doing it so I joined in. Now I have a chance to put some of the wall back together.\"\nThe wall, which stood 12 metres (39 ft) tall and 16 metres wide (52 ft) in some places, was built largely in the Ming dynasty, although some parts dated back to the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368 A.D.), a period of Mongol rule.\nCITY WALL CLEARED TO MAKE ROOM FOR TIANANMEN SQUARE\nLarge chunks of the wall were pulled down in the 1950s when Beijing's communist leaders created Tiananmen Square.\nMore was torn down in the 1960s and 1970s for the construction of one of the city's main roads and for the subway.\nMany of the city gates were left standing, although what had been the Zhonghua Gate is now the site of the mausoleum for late revolutionary leader Mao Zedong in the centre of Tiananmen Square.\nIn more recent years, market-style economic reforms have sent real estate values soaring, leading to the wholesale clearing of older buildings to make way for sleak new office towers.\nOne such real estate project has led to the demolition of homes that had been built up against the wall. The outline of those homes is still visible on the section being restored.\nThe redevelopment has also revealed a bomb shelter, built nearby during tension with the former Soviet Union in the 1960s and using city wall bricks.\nRETIRED SHOEMAKER ANSWERS STATE'S CALL FOR HELP\nHai Changhai, a 71-year-old retired shoemaker, is one of the Beijing residents who answered the state's call to bring back bricks taken home when the wall was demolished.\n\"They were in our yard and weren't doing anyone much good,\" he said after pedalling his tricycle across town to make a donation. \"Now the state can make use of them.\"\nSome Beijing residents point an accusing finger at the state -- and the ruling Communist Party -- for all the destruction of the past.\n\"None of the communist leaders wanted to protect these things,\" said Dai Qing, a dissident writer who has been active in preserving historical relics. \"None of them spoke up.\"\nOne of the few people who did speak out was Liang Sicheng, the head of prestigious Qinghua University's construction department in the early days of communist rule.\n\"He was very critical of the development plans,\" said Cheng Zhihua, a professor at the same department at Qinghua today.\n\"But he had little influence because the official media did not publish his views,\" said Cheng.\nWhat Liang had to say was dangerous then, and he was persecuted for his views during the Cultural Revolution, a decade of leftist fanaticism that began in 1965.\nBeijing officials say there is a growing awareness of the need to preserve the past. Some residents say that may be because so much of the city's heritage has already disappeared.\nSome say other factors may also play a role.\nA museum may be built near the wall when it is restored and city planners soon will have another tourist attraction.\n", "British pub-to-hotel group Greenalls Plc on Thursday reported a 48 percent rise in profits before exceptional items to 148.7 million pounds ($246.4 million), driven by its acquisition of brewer Boddington in November 1995.\n\"The year saw a good trading performance, both from the Greenalls businesses and the former Boddington estate,\" said chairman and chief executive Andrew Thomas. \"Trading in the current year has begun satisfactorily,\" he added.\nExceptional items charged in the year ended September 27, 1996, totalled 31.2 million, including 23.9 million for paying redundancy to former Boddington staff and re-organisation costs.\nUnderlying profit before exceptional items and tax and excluding Boddington increased by 10.7 percent to 111.3 million.\nBoddington generated operating profit of 47.1 million in the 11 months after it was acquired and Greenalls said it saved 18 million in costs from integrating Boddington into the group.\nOverall group profits before tax and exceptional items were at the top end of share analysts' forecasts, which ranged from 145 to 150 million pounds.\nHowever, Greenalls shares fell 7p to 597p after the company ruled out the sale of its De Vere Hotels.\n\"I suspect one of the reasons why the stock has come off is that they ruled out selling off their De Vere brand at this stage.

U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin have agreed to an exchange of state visits, the first since 1989.\nThe diplomats said U.S. officials would continue to raise the human rights issues with the Chinese at every opportunity.\n\"It is a kind of conversation we have with China and other countries that is going to be there as far ahead as we can possibly see,\" the first diplomat said.\n", "NatWest Markets said on Monday that its senior management did not know about the interest rate options pricing problem until three days before the losses were made public.\n\"Senior management did not know until February 25 that there was potentially something of significance,\" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters.\nShe denied a weekend newspaper report suggesting that NatWest, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc knew of the losses some time before they were revealed.\nThe mispricings, which on Thursday NatWest revealed had totalled 90 million pounds ($144 million), had come to light during the course of normal pricing reviews and it had not been able to put a price on the loss until February 28, when NatWest estimated it at 50 million pounds.\nThe initial discovery of the loss came to light through a more intensive review across the investment bank's trading areas, but it was a month or so before the extent of the mispricings became clear.\nThe options losses have been a painful and embarrassing episode for NatWest Markets and its chief executive Martin Owen, who on Thursday said he would forgo 200,000 of a 500,000 pound bonus as a result of the affair.\nNatWest confirmed a report that the girlfriend of Kyriacos Papouis, the former NatWest options trader whom NatWest wants to interview about the losses, also worked for the bank but was employed in derivatives marketing and had nothing to do with Papouis's work.\nShe had been given a holiday period because of the situation, the spokeswoman added.\nPapouis, who left NatWest for U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns, has not commented on the losses. Since the affair came to light he has also resigned from Bear Stearns.\nHe and five others have been reported to British financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and the Bank of England is also looking into what went wrong at the bank.\nNatWest Markets' global head of options, Neil Dodgson, who was suspended from the firm more than two weeks ago when the losses first came to light, is among those who will come under SFA scrutiny.\nThe others suspended last week were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives, and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets.\nWhile the group has maintained that it does not believe any of its clients suffered losses as a result of the options mispricing, which went back as far as 1994, the spokeswoman declined to comment on whether NatWest would try to recoup any gains made by counterparties to any wrongly priced deals.\n\"We haven't determined that that is an issue,\" she said.\nShe dismissed suggestions that morale was low at the bank following last week's revelation that the loss was nearly twice as large as initially thought, the suspension of four senior staff and the cutting of bonuses to a handful of individuals.\n\"We are doing really good business here, and we continue to do good business.

Nick Leeson, the Singapore-based trader whose unauthorised trading led to losses of nearly $1.4 billion, is currently serving a jail sentence for his role in the affair.\nHopkins was also ordered to pay 10,000 pounds ($15,800) towards the SFA's costs after an independent tribunal found that he was no longer \"a fit and proper person\" to be a director of an SFA regulated firm.\n\"Its been difficult for us because it has been without precedent. We've never had to confront this before when someone signed a contract with us to be bound by our rules and then in effect ignored them,\" Nick Durlacher, the SFA's chairman, told Reuters.\nHopkins, one of nine Barings executives to have been disciplined by the SFA, has always protested that the attempted to \"blow the whistle\" on irregularities in the Singapore operation but that other managers ignored his warnings.\n\"I think the tribunal judged that if Mr Hopkins was a whistle blower he didn't have much of a pea in his whistle,\" Durlacher said, adding that Hopkins \"had lived with an unreconciled balance of 100 million pounds for three months\".\nDurlacher said he was \"not vitriolic\" about Hopkins although he said it had not been easy. But if anyone adopted the same approach in the future, the SFA \"would adopt the same process of being as scrupulously fair as we can\".\nHe strongly denied that Hopkins had been dealt with more harshly than others because of his refusal to recognise the SFA's authority over him. Hopkins told British newspapers after the ruling that it had been vindictive.\nDurlacher also denied that he had offered Hopkins a deal as it would not have been up to him to do so anyway. He said he had only had one telephone conversation with him and had been very careful about what he said.\n\"What I did say to Mr Hopkins was that I encouraged him to argue his case in front of us rather than to ignore us,\" he said, adding this could either have involved arguing his case at a tribunal or to considering settling with the SFA, as seven of the other Barings executives disciplined by the SFA had done.\nOnly one Barings case is now outstanding. Ron Baker, who was head of financial products at the firm, is appealing against an SFA tribunal's decision to reprimand him over his monitoring of one part of Barings' proprietory trading activities.

The company hopes municipalities will be interested in purchasing the transmitters to help avoid costly accidents to their vehicles.\n\"It's going to take some time, because municipalities don't have a lot of money,\" Kalov said about selling transmitters.\nThe company is also introducing a product for about $149 that combines Safety Alert, a radar detector and a system to warn drivers when police are using laser to trap speeders in an area.  \nIn fact, the growing use of laser by police should spur sales in the company's detection equipment, Kalov said.\n\"As more and more laser guns are showing up, we believe it's going to create a spurt\" in laser detector sales, he said.\nCobra currently has about 15 percent of the detection market, but it expects its market share to grow to 20 to 25 percent by the end of the year, he said.\nThe company also has about a 35 to 40 percent market share in CB radios, its largest business. It sees that share rising to 50 percent with introduction of technology that reduces background noise and with new distribution channels.  \nKalov said use of CBs, which peaked in the 1970s, is rebounding as people become used to the mobile communications of cellular phones for emergencies but don't want to pay cellular phone charges.\nCB radios also serve a \"chat-room\" function, allowing drivers to get recommendations for restaurants and information on road conditions, Kalov said.\nThe company also maintains a niche profile in the cordless telephone market with less than three percent of the market. Kalov said that the company's goal is to have three to five percent of that market.\n((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787))\n", "An advisor to Governor Chris Patten's inner cabinet said on Monday that property in Hong Kong has become like gold that is not merely worn but kept and accumulated -- giving rise to abnormal demand.\nChen Kwan-yiu, a member on the executive council, also hinted that a quick fix to the British colony's property woes was unlikely.\n\"The current supply of flats is actually adequate for demand, but property has become like gold in the 60s, when it was not only used but was kept as an investment,\" Chen said.\n\"So it has led to an abnormal demand,\" Chen told reporters.

Accepting donations from political groups in Taiwan, however, would be illegal.\nCurbs on protest marches have been slightly relaxed. The original plan required notification to the police not less than seven days before a protest, with discretion for the police to accept late notification up to two days beforehand.\n\"But having considered all views expressed on this subject, the Executive Council of the (future) government has decided to cancel this particular suggestion...the proposed minimum notice of 48 hours will be removed,\" Suen said.\nTung's planned curbs were originally proposed after China's parliament endorsed in February a proposal to change or drop reforms of civil liberties ennacted by the outgoing British colonial administration.\nTung has argued the changes are mere technicalities, needed to strike a balance between freedoms and social order and to guard against interference by foreign forces in local politics.\nHong Kong's popular Democratic Party attacked Tung for paying mere lip service to the consultation exercise.\n\"They (Tung's administration) have not given way at all.

He declined to elaborate.\n\"(But) we are under no illusions that we are going to balance textiles as a single sector of our trade,\" a second diplomat said on condition of anonymity.\nChina exported $6.5 billion worth of textiles to the United States in 1995 but imported only $64 million. Diplomats attributed the sluggish U.S. textile exports to Beijing's high tariff rates and non-tariff barriers.\n\"Textiles are never going to be balanced but it's important that there be a market access element there,\" the second diplomat said.\nThe agreement gave China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact, and China pledged to reduce its tariffs on textile imports.\nBoth the Chinese and U.S. sides declined to say by how much U.S. textile exports to China would increase and vice versa, or by how much China's tariffs would be cut.\n\"There are significant gains for U.S. industries,\" a third diplomat said.\n\"It was, for the first time, a concessionary admission on (the) part of the Chinese that they too had to do something with regard to supplying market access for U.S. products where we were competitive,\" he said but did not go into details.\nThe overall U.S. trade deficit with China -- the United States' largest after its deficit with Japan -- was seen reaching $38 billion in 1996, up from $34 billion in 1995, according to U.S. figures.\nThe new textile agreement may be good news for U.S. textile manufacturers and exporters, but it could be bad news for China's lumbering state enterprises.\nA flood of U.S. textile imports could intensify competition and further cripple many of China's state enterprises, almost half of which are in the red, analysts said.\n\"U.S. textile imports will intensify competition in the already saturated domestic textile market,\" a Chinese economist said.\n\"Life will be even more difficult for a group of loss-making textile enterprises,\" said the economist, who asked not to be identified. \"Some enterprises will be forced to bow out of the textile industry -- declare bankruptcy or merge.\"\nState-owned textile factories in Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, registered losses of 350 million yuan ($42.2 million) in the first seven months of 1996, the China Business Times said on Monday.\nThe accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade U.S. restrictions on Chinese imports.\nChina had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but delayed the action to allow time for further talks.\nBeijing announced after Sunday's deal that it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but Washington's penalties remained in force.\n", "Anglo-U.S. drugs group SmithKline Beecham Plc said on Tuesday that it expected anti-depressent Paxil/Seroxat to take over as its best-selling drug by the end of this year.\nIn a telephone interview with Reuters finance director Hugh Collum said it was probable that Paxil/Seroxat \"will be the biggest selling product by the end of this year.\"Sales of the drug, which competes with Eli Lilly &amp; Co's Prozac, jumped 42 percent last year to 706 million stg, gaining ground on SmithKline's current top seller, antibiotic Augmentin.  \n\"The added indication of panic disorder gives us added uniqueness\" in comparison with Prozac, said Collum. Although he declined to give sales targets for Paxil, he said \"we are very optimistic\" and noted that Prozac sales were in excess of $2 billion a year.\nThe finance director also highlighted the Havrix hepatitis A vaccine, Hycamtin for ovarian cancer and anti-emetic Kytril as potential strong growth products looking ahead, together with combination vaccines like Infanrix.  \nSmithKline does not expect drugs to flow from its DNA research link with Human Genome Sciences (HGS) until after the turn of the century, Collum said. But he noted the licensing arrangements on DNA-based drugs already in place with major competitors including Merck &amp; Co and Schering-Plough Corp and added \"we are very optimistic. Looking back I think it was a very good investment decision.\"\nCollum said he was \"really very pleased\" at the reduction in the group's stubbornly high debt levels, which came down to 1.64 billion stg at the end of 1996 from around 1.8 billion at the start of the year.  \nHowever, he said that with capital expenditure expected to total around 550 million stg this year, debt levels would only \"come down a bit\" in 1997.\nHe said operating margins would continue to be affected by high research and development spending and marketing costs related to over-the-counter products.\nCollum said he hoped the Clinical Laboratories operation, which has been hit by changes in U.S. reimbursement rules for diagnostic tests, was \"back on track.\"\n\"We hope so.

It has metals processing and enriching plants and some of the world's richest mines of nickel, platinum, palladium, cobalt, copper and gold.\nThe new generations of Norilsk's 300,000 residents -- some descendents of Stalin's victims, others children of later, hardy souls who headed north decades ago for higher wages -- are miners and metalworkers who look a decade older than they are.\n\"It's so ecologically dangerous in Norilsk, you aren't even supposed to give birth here,\" said Sergei Yurshov, director of the main nickel plant's electrolysing unit.\nNorilsk says it is in the throes of financial crisis -- but its streets are literally paved with gold.\nTonnes of filthy cancer-inducing black slag, sparkling with precious metals, are collected from the smelters and sifted over streets to keep them from freezing.\n\"The state sees the bullion, but this is all we see,\" said Boris Degtyarov, an official at the main trade union.\nThere is more beautiful poison at the electrolysing plant, where luminous, lime-green liquid nickel, laced with electricity, is processed from matt black slabs glinting with the earth's most prized metals.\nThe dark cobbled floors and 1940s technology, exposing steel entrails and frames of processing lines, have a mediaeval air.\nConcentrations of carcinogenic nickel in the air are 200 times Western norms and 20,000 times the worthy but never attained Soviet standard.\nIn Norilsk, women retire at 40, men at 45. Degtyarov says 90 percent of newborn babies have serious illnesses or handicaps. An aura of illness pervades everything here. One mine, Keyerkan, means Valley of Death in the language of the local Dolgan people.\nDespite the richness of its ore mines, Norilsk has not created wealth for its workers.\nDifficulties in keeping tabs on just who exports its multi-billion dollar output, and vast tax arrears have not helped the labour force, whose wages are two months behind.\n\"Where's the money for the metals going?\" asked Rubeko, shaking his silver-haired head. \"That I cannot understand.\"\nA FROZEN, UNDERGROUND HELL\nDeep in the Taimyr mine, 1.5 km (one mile) below the permafrost, is a darker world, where miners labour round the clock in shifts and cavernous tunnels worm through the earth.\nGet lost and you are in severe danger -- engineers daily blast out new galleries with dynamite.

Now the remains of that vision are being tested by new market forces. Already hundreds of homeless live in the town's boiler plants.\nCompany officials speak of uprooting pensioners to warmer climes, where they would cost less to support, and of the need to trim a bloated workforce.\nThe plans have made Norilsk a barometer of the troubles faced by Russian industries in casting off their Soviet legacy. But they are hotly contested.\n\"You'd need two Kalashnikovs for every policeman if you had a load of unemployed wandering these streets,\" Degtyarov said.\nRubeko, dragged to Norilsk in 1938 after a midnight knock at his door in southern Russia, despairs at the thought of a second exile. \"You can't resettle an 85-year-old man,\" he said.\nAfter working at Norilsk for 66 years, Rubeko, now head of the local chapter of the Society for the Defence of the Victims of Stalinist Repressions, cannot even afford new shoes.\nWhen asked what Norilsk was for him, he answered, \"a grave\".\nBut he is not a dead soul.\n\"People related better to each other in the old days -- they were kinder and more spiritual.\n\"Everyone thought Stalin would die and we would survive this,\" he said with a smile. \"And that is what happened.\"\n", "The UK government on Monday threatened to scupper a bid by London Clubs International for rival casino group Capital Corp when they passed it to competition authorities.\nConsumer Affairs Minister John Taylor said the 190 million pound ($310 million) hostile bid raised competition concerns in relation to the London casinos market. He referred it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).\nLondon Clubs, which operates seven casinos in the British capital, said it was disappointed by the decision.\n\"We believe that the arguments which we submitted to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) provided sound evidence that there were no adverse competition issues,\" said London Clubs chief executive Alan Goodenough.\nThe MMC has until July 7 to decide on the issue. The referral means the bid automatically lapses.\nLondon Clubs said its board would meet to consider future action. It could come up with a fresh bid if the MMC clears the proposed acquisition of Capital, which operates Crockfords and the Colony Club for high rollers in the swish Mayfair area of London.\nA merged company would have controlled almost two-thirds of London's 1.7 billion pound casino market.\nShares in Capital Corp fell 15.5p to 184.5p after the bid was scrapped. They had stood at 171p on February 14, the day before the bid was tabled. London Clubs came off 6.5p to 402p, having risen from 385p during the bid process.\nLondon Clubs had been offering 47 of its shares for every 100 in Capital Corp in its all-paper offer. Share analysts had forecast a sweetened offer from London Clubs.\nCapital Corp chief executive Alan Hearn welcomed the MMC referral, repeating that the bid was too low.\n\"The referral enables us to focus on developing further the group's valuable business, without the distraction and expense of a hostile bid,\" he said. \"I welcome the opportunity to demonstrate to shareholders the significant value we can create as an independent company.\"\nHotel and gaming company Ladbroke Group Plc, which has four London casinos, had been mentioned as a possible rival bidder for Capital Corp.

The two companies gradually began to trust each other and the synergies between them have emerged slowly but surely.\nAfter an initial flurry of employee exits when Lotus reluctantly agreed to be acquired by IBM for $3.5 billion in June 1995, staff defections eventually stabilized to a normal industry attrition rate.  Lotus's worst fear -- that most of its intellectual capital, its employees, would quit -- was not realized.  \n\"There are more disastrous mergers in this business,\" Papows said. \"I don't think anyone would have predicted this would go as well as it has.\"\nThe Technology sector has been fraught with mergers gone awry, such as AT&amp;T Corp's purchase of NCR Corp, which it just spun out again as a separate unit.  And IBM had its own unsuccessful deal, when it purchased Rolm Corp in the 1980s.\nIBM chairman and CEO Louis Gerstner echoed Papows's view.  \nIn a brief speech at Lotusphere, Gerstner also said the merger was now working, with \"irrefutable\" evidence, such as the doubling of the number of seats of Lotus Notes sold in 1996, when the number of users reached 9.5 million.\nPapows said that besides IBM's big financial pockets and its vast research laboratories, the computer giant also has an incredible global reach through its world-class sales force.\nAnd Gerstner, Papows said, has become \"my single best sales person.\"  \nPapows said Gerstner recently picked up the phone to speak to the CEO of Rockwell International Corp, and after he explained how important Notes was to IBM's strategy, Rockwelll made a big investment in Notes for its corporate network.\nThe combination of IBM's clout and reach and Lotus's technology will help it maintain leadership in groupware, as the turf is under siege by Netscape Communications Corp and Microsoft Corp, Papows said.  \nAnother plus to having IBM as an owner is that the companies can work together to link corporate networks running Lotus Notes to the vast arrays of information stored in IBM mainframes and minicomputers around the world.\n\"There is a tremendous opportunity to unlock this data,\" Papows said.  \"Netscape doesn't understand this.\"  On Wednesday, IBM and Lotus will unveil versions of the Notes Domino server for the IBM AS/400 minicomputer and the S/390 mainframe lines as part of this strategy.\nDomino, Lotus's Notes server designed using Internet standards, has become Lotus's crown jewel.  \nUsers applauded Lotus' move to embrace the open architecture of the Internet, after many skeptics said after IBM bought Lotus that Notes was dead because of the industry's jump to the Web.\n\"We all heard the refrain, 'Notes is dead,'\" Papows told the conference, adding that it was nothing less than masterful what Lotus has done with Notes and with Sun Microsystems Inc's Java programming language, which is used to develop applications for the Internet that will run anywhere.  \nLotus will introduce a new client version of Notes, Version 4.6 (code-named Lookout) in the first half of this year with a simplified user interface and seamless integration of Microsoft's Internet Explorer and other Web products.\nThe code name Lookout is a jab at Microsoft, which just introduced a feature called \"Outlook\" in its Office 97 suite. Another upgrade will come in the fourth quarter with Version 5.0, code-named Maui.  Maui will feature even more support of Internet protocols.\nLotus is also working on a set of so-called \"applets\" developed in Java, including a spreadsheet, a calendar, text editor and other pieces, to run on the stripped-down networked computers.  These applications are much less code intensive, with much of the software residing on the severs that run networks.\n", "AT&amp;T Corp. said Monday its first-quarter profits fell 17 percent, trimmed by competition in long-distance services and investments in new businesses, and warned second quarter results might be weak as well.\nMeanwhile, BellSouth Corp., a consistent top performer among regional telephone companies, said its operating earnings rose 11 percent due to a rise in the number of customer lines and strong growth in its wireless operations.\nAT&amp;T said it earned $1.13 billion, or 69 cents a share, on revenues of $13.05 billion, down from net income of $1.36 billion, or 85 cents a share, on revenues of $12.85 billion in the first quarter of 1996.\nAT&amp;T's earnings per share for the first quarter were in line with Wall Street's expectations based on previous guidance the company had provided financial analysts.\n\"Results are where we expected them to be as we implement our strategy,\" Chairman Robert Allen said in a statement.\nIn a conference call Monday, AT&amp;T also warned that its second quarter results were likely to be weaker than the first quarter but that its expectations for the full year remained on track.\nSeveral Wall Street analysts said they planned to reduce their earnings estimates for the remainder of the year.\n\"There was not a great deal to cheer in the results,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Klugman said.\nAT&amp;T's first quarter revenue increase was driven by growth in local telephone service and other initiatives, business long-distance services and wireless services. That was partially offset by declines in financial services and consumer long-distance revenues, the company said.\nAT&amp;T said long-distance calling volume in the most recent quarter increased by 6.7 percent over the same period of 1996, but revenue from those services rose only 0.6 percent to $11.51 billion.\nVolume from consumer long-distance was flat and revenue fell 1 percent to $6.06 billion, the company said. Revenue from business long-distance rose 2.4 percent on a double-digit increase in volume.\nAT&amp;T said expansion in online, local and international operations reduced its quarterly per share income by 25 cents. A year earlier, those expenses reduced earnings by 10 cents a share, AT&amp;T said.\nAtlanta-based BellSouth said it earned $693 million, or 70 cents a share, on revenues of $4.8 billion in the three months ended March 31, slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations.\nA year earlier the company earned $626 million, or 63 cents a share, before a one-time gain of $344 million, or 35 cents a share, on the sale of paging operations.\nRevenues were $4.5 billion in the 1996 quarter.\n\"BellSouth's 17th consecutive quarter of improved operating results was driven by our innovative marketing,\" said Chief Executive Officer Duane Ackerman, adding that, \"Sales increased across the board.\"\nThe company said the number of customer lines increased by 379,000 -- the biggest gain for any quarter in its history, breaking the old mark of 359,000 set in the first quarter of 1996. BellSouth now has a total of 22.5 milllion access lines.\nBellSouth said the company's U.S. cellular operations ended the first quarter with 3.8 million customers, reflecting an annual growth rate of 24 percent. In international cellular markets, customers rose 76 percent since the first quarter of 1996, reaching 1.5 million.\n\"These are just blistering numbers,\" Montgomery Securities analyst Bill Vogel said of BellSouth's growth in customer access lines and the value-added services like Caller ID and Call Waiting the company offers in addition to basic access.\n\"They not only have the access lines growing, but the services on those lines growing sharply,\" he said.\nVogel, who maintains a \"buy\" rating on the stock, said he expected BellSouth earnings to accelerate beyond the 11 percent rise seen in the first quarter as the company benefits from rising growth in new services.\nBellSouth stock was down $1.125 at $39.875 and AT&amp;T stock was off 75 cents at $32.875, both in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "The Sydney 2000 Olympics does not appear to be generating the economic bonanza many had hoped for and will not boost Sydney house prices, two construction and real estate forecasters said on Tuesday.\n\"The impact of the Olympics hasn't been as great as we'd been led to believe,\" Knight Frank Independent director Philip Ragan told a Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) seminar.\nConstruction of the games facilities and preparations for the games were in full swing, but were not yet adding significantly to the economy, Ragan said.\nIn 1993, when the Sydney was awarded the games, analysts forecast that the extra construction, tourism and jobs generated by the games would cumulatively add A$7 billion (US$5.3 billion) to A$8 billion to gross domestic product by 2001.\nRagan said the cumulative economic effect was likely to be closer to A$3 billion because of cost over-runs, lower revenue projections and the leakage of sponsorship revenues offshore.\n\"The outcome is coming in at the low end of expectations, in fact, significantly lower,\" Ragan said.\nOlympics-related job creation had originally been estimated at about 150,000, but only 800 specific jobs had been created so far and only about 2,800 temporary jobs were seen in 2000, he said.\nThe state government and various private consortia are expected to spend about A$3.2 billion building new facilities.\nBut Ragan said this amount spent over four years was not a major increase on the A$10 billion spent each year on such construction in Sydney.\nAn expected nine percent rise in state government revenues and a trend towards higher savings would also swamp the Olympic-led boost to the local economy, he said.\n\"The effect of the Olympics is being more than overshadowed by other changes happening in the economy,\" he said.\nBIS Schrapnel building and construction director Robert Mellor said he expected Sydney property prices to rise almost 40 percent in the lead up to the year 2000 and then slide in the years immediately after the Olympics.\nBut Mellor said this would have happened regardless of Sydney having the Olympics.\n\"It's got nothing to do with the Olympics. I don't see it having any effect,\" Mellor told the CEDA seminar.\n\"The positives may not be as great as the econometric models may indicate,\" he said.\nThe Atlanta Olympics had shown retailers and street traders had not done nearly as well as expected, Mellor said.\nHe pointed to the recent rash of legal actions by Atlanta's Olympic vendors against organisers for promising unrealistic likely incomes.\nThose residential areas very close to the games site at Homebush Bay in Sydney's Western Suburbs may benefit from the new recreational facilities built there, but the bulk of Sydney's housing market would not notice.\nHe said the prospect of some home owners being able to rent out their homes for A$1,000 or A$2,000 for two weeks was unlikely to provide a general boost to the market.\n\"It just doesn't change the fundamental reason for buying a house in Sydney,\" he said.\n(A$=US$0.7590)\n", "British clothing group Courtaulds Textiles Plc signalled on Tuesday that it plans to shift much of its production to cheaper Asian markets as it battles to return to profitability.\nThe company, which is behind a host of famous brands including Gossard lingerie and Jockey underwear, refused to spell out details but said the shift will mean job losses in Britain and western Europe.\nIt is to spend up to 35 million pounds ($54 million) restructuring its business and create four product-led divisions.\nExceptional charges helped push Courtaulds Textiles to a pre-tax loss of 8.5 million pounds compared with a profit of 6.4 million in the first half last year. Excluding exceptional charges, pre-tax profit fell to 600,000 pounds from 10.3 million.\nThe depressed state of Britain's clothing industry is expected to be underlined on Wednesday when Courtaulds' rival Coats Viyella Plc, which unveiled a shock 50 million pound restructuring charge in March, reveals its interim results.\nShares in Courtaulds Textiles closed five pence higher at 310p, but analysts were adopting a wait-and-see approach.\nOne analyst who asked not to be named said \"...four or five years ago this was deemed the well-managed stock in the sector, the leading light.\" He added that Courtaulds is taking action late \"...and they are paying the price for catching-up.\"\nThe group's new chief executive, Colin Dyer, said his aim is to move ahead speedily on reorganisation, which includes further disposals, and get back to a \"clean set of results.\"\n\"The most important thing is that we are attacking our problems and putting them right quickly,\" said Dyer, who was appointed in June with a brief to shake-up the group.\nHe signalled his intention of \"moving the cost base from Britain and western Europe to lower cost manufacturing,\" and warned that opposition Labour Party plans to introduce a minimum wage in Britain would make matters worse.\nDyer said the Far East offered clear advantages in terms of labour costs and access to raw materials. The group already operates in the Philippines and Thailand, where it makes stretch fabrics.\nThe decline in first-half profits was led by Courtaulds' fabrics division and resulted from weak demand in the U.S. and in continental European lace, as well as reorganisation costs.\nCourtaulds has sold around half its hit list of a dozen problem businesses, with three disposals announced last week, and Dyer said talks on \"one or two\" of the remaining sales are \"quite advanced.\"\nCourtaulds took a 9.1 million pounds restructuring charge in the six months to June, and expects to generate cost-savings of 10 to 13 million pounds a year by 1998.\nDyer said benefits \"will be kicking in a bit this year, but significantly in 1998.\"\nHe declined to give exact forecasts for 1996 as a whole, but added that analysts' profit forecasts \"are not far away on the full year.\" Analysts are predicting full-year pre-tax profit of between 34.0 and 40.6 million pounds before exceptional items.\nMost of the restucturing charge will hit second-half earnings.

All of them are vice-chairmen of the military commission while Chi also serves as defence minister.\nJiang told his audience that the party's leadership had enabled military victories of the past and made the armed forces stronger.\nBut he said the drive to modernise the three million strong army had created a range of problems and warned officers not to step outside the law while performing their duties.\n\"Cadres at various levels must run the army with strict discipline and according to law and do their routine ideological and managerial work in a meticulous way,\" he said.\nThe army that ushered in nearly five decades of communist rule has benefited immensely from capitalist-style reforms launched by Deng in the late 1970s, running luxury hotels, factories and dealing in real estate.\nTold by Beijing to make money for itself to supplement its budget, the army has also been widely accused of smuggling and other official abuses of power in its drive to do so.\nChina has set a defence budget of 80.6 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) this year, a rise of 12.7 percent over actual spending for 1996.\nWestern military analysts say total defence spending is considerably higher than the published figures.\nBeijing defends its hefty increases in military spending by saying the base figure is still low and inflation has cut buying power.\n", "Federal-Mogul Corp., dropping its four-year effort to build a global auto parts retail empire, unveiled a massive restructuring Thursday that returns it to its core manufacturing and distribution business.\nThe Southfield, Mich.-based company said it took a total of $264 million in pre-tax charges to cover the restructuring and special one-time items from the fourth quarter.\nFederal-Mogul, which has about $2 billion in annual sales, also said it will slash about 2,900 jobs, equal to 18.5 percent of its worldwide workforce of 15,700.\nThe charges resulted in a net loss of $220.2 million for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $49.1 million for the 1995 period.\nFor all of 1996, the company lost $211.1 million, but would have posted a profit of $34.7 million before special items. In 1995 the company lost $9.7 million.\n\"We have realigned our growth strategy behind our core competencies of engineering, manufacturing and distribution,\" Chairman Dick Snell said in a statement. \"Our retail operations are good viable businesses that can be operated better by someone else.\"\nThe company makes a wide variety of products, ranging from engine bearings, oil seals and pistons to lighting and electrical components, for the auto, farm and construction vehicle industry.\nIn afternoon trading, Federal Mogul stock was up $1.125 at $24.625 share on the New York Stock Exchange.\nNicholas Colas, an analyst at CS First Boston said the move was a prudent one for the company, which had no in-house retail expertise when it began to expand in that area.\n\"Basically, the grand vision of having an international third world distribution and retail business is gone,\" he said. \"This is much more playing to the company's historical strengths.\"\nIncluded in the restructuring is the planned sale of 132 international retail operations in Australia, Chile, Ecuador, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Africa, and Venezuela, and the planned sale or restructuring of about 30 wholesale operations in 10 countries.\nThe firm also plans to relocate product lines in its European manufacturing operations and cut the workforce; consolidate lighting products in Juarez, Mexico, and close a manufacturing facility in Indiana.\nThe company also plans to close two distribution warehouses in Kentucky, consolidate customer support functions in the United States and streamline administration and operational staff functions worldwide.\nIncluded in that is the moving of European aftermarket management functions in Geneva, Switzerland, to manufacturing headquarters in Wiesbaden, Germany.\nThe moves are a complete reversal of the efforts by former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Gormley, who was forced to resign in September after pressure from the board.\nGormley had spent about $500 million on acquisitions since 1992, although a company spokeswoman said less than one-third of that was related to the international retail expansion.\nFederal-Mogul director Steve Miller took over on an interim basis until Snell was hired Nov. 8.\nSnell said in a statement that there will be further restructuring. He said moves will generate positive cash flow, adding the company expects a \"positive economic value-added\" by 1998.\nColas said future restructuring charges will range between $5 million and $7 million in the next couple of years.\n\"The guiding light at this company has shifted from trying to create earnings growth to creating shareholder value,\" Colas said.\n", "Pearson Plc's new chief executive Marjorie Scardino, the first woman to head a major British company, vowed on Monday to improve the financial performance of the media and leisure group.\nPearson announced a 1996 operating profit of 281 million pounds ($451 million), a rise of eight percent, before taking a 100 million pound charge for improper accounting at its Penguin USA trade book publishing subsidiary.\nFinance Director John Makinson said that he did not expect Pearson to have to increase the provision to cover the problems at Penguin USA, which date back to 1991.\n\"We are comfortable with that provision,\" Makinson told Reuters in a telephone interview. \"The 100 million pounds is to cover all known and foreseen eventualities,\" he added.\nMakinson dismissed a report in the Sunday Times newspaper that the charge could double as a result of legal action by book retailers in the United States.\nPearson increased its full year dividend to 18p from 16.5p. The company's shares slipped 9p to 765p in early trading although the figures were broadly in line with market forecasts.\nA great deal of market attention focused on the plans of Texan Scardino, who took the reins at Pearson in January.\nShe acknowledged that the company's profit performance must improve but gave few clues as to which parts of the business could be sacrificied in her drive for focus.\nAmong Pearson's assets are the Financial Times newspaper, a number of television production companies and a leisure arm which includes London's Madame Tussaud's waxworks museum.\n\"The major immediate changes under new management at Pearson will be the ones of style and focus on performance. As time goes on, we may change the business we're in too, as we work toward being first in a few important markets,\" Scardino said.\n\"But we won't be selling things just to be tidy. We'll be selling things where the move will make the company more valuable for our shareholders -- of today and tomorrow.\"\nThe leisure operations and a 50 percent stake in London merchant bank Lazard Brothers have been seen as possible candidates for disposal.\nScardino said greater emphasis would be based on performance measures for the operating companies. She also said that running the company as an integrated media group would create considerable scope to increase revenues and reduce costs.\nPearson also announced that it would invest up to 100 million pounds over the next five years in extending the Financial Times newspaper and brand internationally.\nNew print sites are to be established in Italy and Singapore but the main thrust of the expansion will focus on the United States. Financial Times editor Richard Lambert will be moving to New York for a year to oversee the editorial development.\nPearson added that the group had made a satisfactory start to the current year with operating profits in line with expectations.

Major Japanese asset management firms, big trust banks and life insurers have suspended business dealings with Nomura, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp said it would take steps to alter its business ties with the brokerage.\nJapan's Postal Life Insurance Bureau (Kampo) and Finance Ministry officials are waiting for the outcome of the SESC probe before deciding whether to suspend their bond business with Nomura, and other major Nomura clients also said they are watching the outcome of the SESC's probe.\n\"It is actually a big blow on our business,\" said a Nomura official, who declined to be named. \"Even before the SESC probe is concluded and the Finance Ministry decides to impose penalties, institutional investors have begun to punish us.\"\n", "British Airways World Cargo plans to increase its wet lease freighter service between Hong Kong and London to a daily frequency when the territory's new airport opens next year, the airline's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan, has told Reuters.\nBA is also planning to step up its three times a week freighter link from Hong Kong to London Gatwick to four times weekly later this year, Chan said in an interview.\nIt now operates Boeing 747-200 freighters wet leased from Atlas Air in addition to sizeable belly capacity aboard 14 Boeing 747-400 passenger flights a week to Heathrow.\nWet leasing involves the supply of an aircraft with crew, fuel, supplies and supporting services.\nThe proposed daily freighter service from Hong Kong could be switched to Heathrow where BA is building a new dedicated terminal provided suitable slots become available, Chan added.\n\"We are hoping to start the fourth weekly frequency late this summer and a daily service from next year as we continue to expand.

But industry sources said only eight banks can take gold out of the country as collateral to finance projects and that domestic financing had yet to increase output.\n\"Unfortunately, there really have not been any significant structural changes in financing,\" said Mikhail Katsman, executive director of Russia's Union of Gold Producers, a non-government organisation.\nAbout 85 percent of all gold mined in Russia last year was from above-ground alluvial, or placer, deposits, as opposed to below-ground ore deposits. But since 80 percent of Russia's known gold reserves are in the ground, big investment dollars will be needed soon if output is to increase significantly.\nOutput last year fell to about 122 tonnes, largely because alluvial reserves are being depleted, taxes hit producers at 60 percent of revenues and state funding has declined.\nState forecasts say 1996 output is likely to slip further.\nNearly two thirds of the country's gold is mined in Russia's Far East, a quarter comes out of Eastern Siberia and 12 percent out of the Urals, with small cooperatives, known as artels, accounting for about 60 percent of output.\nIn one of Russia's best-known projects and the one analysts say is the furthest along, Cyprus Magadan Gold, a unit of Amax Gold Inc, owns a 50 percent stake in the Omolon Gold Mining Company project to develop the Kubaka reserve in the Far Eastern Magadan region.\nOutput, expected to begin in 1997, is targeted at an annual average rate of 310,000 ounces of gold and 235,000 ounces of silver over seven years.\nBut other projects have stumbled or worse.\nBritain's RTZ Corp Plc pulled out of its only Russia project in May over royalty and tax squabbles with Moscow.\n\"If I were a foreign company, I would see a tonne of problems to foreign investment in Russian gold,\" Katsman said.\n-- Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520\n", "The world's second largest nickel producer, Russia's Norilsk Nickel, averted a dockworkers' strike on Monday but spoke of its dire financial straits and told employees to steel themselves for cutbacks.\nA group of workers at Norilsk, a town built by Soviet-era forced labour in the Arctic Circle, called off their threat to stop loading metals for export from the port of Dudinka, Norilsk spokesman Sergei Vetchinin said.\nBut he said the company was in deep financial trouble -- surprising analysts who had thought RAO Norilsk Nikel's new majority shareholder, Uneximbank, was closer to turning the giant nickel, copper and precious metals producer around.\n\"There is an appalling collapse at Norilsk,\" said metals trader Ruslan Fedorovsky of Barclays Physical Trading Ltd in London. \"It's a complete breakdown and there is little control over the situation.\"\nVetchinin said lay-offs could hit 80,000 non-production employees at Norilsk's flagship combine. \"You would think this is a construction outfit, not a mining and metallurgy plant,\" he said, referring to the number of ancillary workers.\n\"We've described the depths of our financial crisis and they understand,\" he said, adding that 800 million (corrects from 800 billion) roubles ($150 million) of delayed wages would be paid off by November.\nBut Norilsk workers, once laid off, have nowhere to go -- leaving markets to wonder how labour unrest and sluggish cash flow could affect the company's production and exports.\n\"A number of us were surprised by the depth and severity of the problems there,\" said metals analyst Raj Kohli of MC Securities in London. \"There will be some ongoing disruptions.\"\nNorilsk is looking to state bail-outs and a share issue to pay off its total 13 trillion rouble ($2.3 billion) debt and plans a new financial austerity programme by November as part of its restructuring scheme, Vetchinin said.\nBut he said Uneximbank, a big commercial bank whose founders include Soviet-era state commodities exporters, had no more cash to pump into Norilsk.\nNorilsk, which has long said it is revamping the way it exports metals abroad, said it would focus on selling to end-users like German stainless steel group Krupp Thyssen Nirosta GmbH (KTN), which groups Fried Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp and Thyssen AG.\nThe move could leave Western commodities houses fighting over fewer contracts.\nMetals analysts are surprised that Norilsk's strong 1995 pre-tax profit of nearly 5.5 trillion roubles ($95 billion) (corrects dollar conversion from $1 billion) has not translated into enough cash to meet immediate needs like overdue salaries and back taxes.\nVetchinin said that softer world metals prices meant that even exporters who pre-paid were not providing enough cash.\nNorilsk produced 180,100 tonnes of nickel in 1995, up 11 percent on 1994, and sees 1996 production rising three percent.\n\"The more major issue is how much longer it can go without big investments in its fixed assets,\" Kohli said, adding that around $1 billion was a ballpark figure needed.\n\"But we're optimistic, because as an ore body it's extremely wealthy and can produce large volumes at relatively low cost.\"\nStill, others expect possible volatility in Norilsk's production and exports.

Excluding the charge, profit rose by seven percent, putting them at the lower end of stock market forecasts.\nChief executive Martin Broughton told reporters that while the company maintained its stance that it had no liability, it now considered it sensible to look at settling U.S. tobacco claims in the context of agreement with Congress.\n\"The on-going cost in legal terms, and the impact on the share price is such that we think it sensible and appropriate to evaluate a settlement,\" he said.\nHe put the legal costs at $100 million in 1996, which he expected to rise at least for the next two years.\nA sensible settlement would be one that covered all current and future claims and was approved by Congress and the White House, he said.\nSo far B.A.T has not been approached by plaintiffs or the U.S. government with any sensible proposals, said Broughton.\n\"There ought to be a sensible figure which gets it sorted out,\" he said. He called plaintiffs' suggestions of $10 billion and $6 billion, which represents the profits of the entire U.S. tobacco industry, unacceptable.\nHe said the company remained confident it would ultimately win any cases against it.\nB.A.T estimates it has spent 250 million pounds ($402.9 million) in legal costs fighting tobacco-related law suits.\nAbout 500 cases have been filed since 1954, but only 19 have so far reached the courts across the industry.\nAs well as disappointment over the exceptional insurance charge some analysts had hoped B.A.T would say more about the possible demerger of its tobacco and insurance arms.\nB.A.T shares, up 32 percent since November on promising perceptions about its legal battles in the U.S., tumbled 20 pence to close at 530 pence on Wednesday.\nChairman Lord Cairns told reporters the company kept an open mind on its corporate structure.\n\"We are not wedded to the structure that we have at the moment.

Peptide said it could receive another 24 million pounds from SmithKline, excluding any royalties on eventual sales.\nSmithKline's seal of approval for Peptide's science follows another high profile coup late last month, when Medeva PLC agreed to transfer its know-how in developing oral and nasal vaccines to the company. Peptide is now working on non-injectable vaccines to block a range of infections such as typhoid, flu and food poisoning by the e-coli bug.\nYamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said Peptide had \"got some quite impressive partnerships.

30.\nNarodick, who said she had \"great confidence\" in Stanger, will remain on Edmark's board.\n", "China gave new details on Wednesday of the failed launch of a satellite aboard its Long March 3B rocket in February, confirming that the cause lay with the new generation launcher.\nThe report concluded that the failure of the Long March 3B was due to an electrical problem in the power module of the \"inertial platform\" that operated the rocket's direction controls.\n\"There was no electric current output from the power module in the servo-loop on the follow-up frame of the inertia platform,\" a spokesman for the China Great Wall Industrial Corp, which handles China's launches, quoted the report as saying.\n\"All other systems operated normally,\" the report said.\nThe initial report had said briefly that the problem was a failure of the rocket's inertial platform.\nThe Long March 3B, which was being used in a launch for the first time, veered wildly seconds after lift-off from the Xichang satellite centre in southwestern Sichuan province.\nIt ended its flight in a spectacular explosion that destroyed the rocket and the U.S.-made Intelsat satellite it was carrying.\nThe latest report said the rocket smashed into a hillside 1.85 km (1.2 miles) from the launch site.\nOfficial reports said six people were killed and 57 injured, although a video smuggled out by an Israeli scientist showed extensive damage to buildings in the area, suggesting that the number of casualties might have been considerably higher.\nThe final report said that because of the severity of the explosion, no large pieces of wreckage of the satellite or the rocket remained.\nThe report's conclusions were drawn largely from film of the launch and data from remote testing.\nChina's space programme once had a reputation for dependability, but has been marred by a string of recent failures.\nIt suffered a blow to its hopes to capture a significant share of the commercial satellite launch market when a Long March 3 rocket failed to lift a U.S.-built satellite into proper orbit last month.\nThe preliminary conclusion blamed the failure on a problem with the third-stage booster of the Long March 3 rocket, which is supposed to be one of China's most reliable launch vehicles.\nChina has come under pressure from potential foreign customers as well as the insurance industry to disclose more information on the problems with its launches so far.\nIn January 1995, a Long March rocket blew up, destroying the Apstar 2 satellite and killing six people on the ground.\nHowever, China successfully launched Hong Kong's Apstar 1A telecommunications satellite in July after delaying the launch following last February's Long March 3B explosion.\n", "South Korea on Tuesday urged \"extraordinary alertness\" against the rival North, warning that the defection of a senior North Korean official now marooned in Seoul's Beijing embassy showed the hermit state was unstable.\nAs China reinforced security at the South Korean mission, there was little sign of progress in the diplomatic deadlock with the two rival Koreas on what to do with Hwang Jang-yop, the most senior North Korean to betray his Stalinist homeland.\nIt was Hwang's seventh day in Seoul's consulate office.\nAppeals for calm from China, an unwilling third party in the latest Cold War crisis, appeared to yield fruit with North Korea showing signs of backing off from its hard line over its highest ever defector.\nBut South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung called for \"extraordinary alertness\" against the North.\n\"The defection of secretary Hwang Jang-yop, who belongs to the core force of the North Korean leadership, vividly displays the shaking of the ideological foundation that has supported the North Korean system amid economic disasters,\" he said.\nHwang, one of 11 powerful secretaries of the ruling Workers' Party along with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, sought refuge at Seoul's mission in the Chinese capital last Wednesday.\nLee told parliament the communist North had increasingly deployed offensive forces near the border with the South, despite an economic crisis and chronic food shortage at home.\nWhile repeating its appeals for calm, China was prepared for disturbances.\nPolice guarding the mission where Hwang is stranded went on higher alert, and three armoured personnel carriers filled with helmeted paramilitary police rumbled into the sedate diplomatic quarter to back up squads of police armed with assault rifles.\n\"We hope all parties can deal with this matter calmly... and calmly face and appropriately handle this incident to maintain peace and stability in the Korean peninsula,\" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.\nSeoul and Beijing were working to find a solution to the three-way diplomatic crisis that has thrown relations among China and the two Koreas into turmoil, Seoul officials said.\n\"Negotiations with the Chinese government are still going on,\" said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik, but declined to give details.\nHe dismissed reports that three-way talks between Beijing, its old communist ally Pyongyang and its new capitalist friend Seoul were under way to break the deadlock over Hwang's fate.\nThe North has hinted it may accept Hwang's defection, saying it would dismiss him if he sought asylum.\n\"It is certain North Korea is changing its attitude,\" said Kim Kyung-woong, a senior official of Seoul's state South-North Dialogue Office.\nNorth Korea's Foreign Ministry said late on Monday it would fire Hwang if he sought asylum in Seoul but warned of \"decisive countermeasures\" if it were proved he had been kidnapped.\nNorth Korea had earlier maintained Seoul kidnapped Hwang, architect of the Stalinist nation's governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance. Seoul called the charge preposterous.\nThe tussle over Hwang's defection was the latest flare-up in tense relations between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 Korean civil war ended only in a truce.\nThe United States has urged Pyongyang to avoid all provocative actions and has said it was closely monitoring developments after an assassination attempt against a former North Korean defector near Seoul on Saturday night.\nSouth Korea accused Pyongyang agents of shooting 32-year-old Li Il-nam in an attack that left him critically ill with a bullet still lodged in his skull. Doctors in Seoul said he was on life support and unlikely to regain consciousness.\n", "U.S. Commerce Department is forming a committee to advise the department on its controversial computer encryption export policy, Commerce officials said on Friday.\nThe committee, which will be called the President's Export Council Subcommittee on Encryption, will be composed of about 25 members, drawn from state and local law enforcement agencies and the private sector, according to Sue Eckert, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration.  \nBut the committee is not intended as a forum to debate the merits of the current export policy, Eckert told Reuters.\n\"This is not a debating forum towards policy in general,\" Eckert said in a telephone interview. \"It is the advisory group to provide input to implementation of our policy.\"\nCurrent law restricts the export of encryption technology, computer programs that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"  \nBut many software companies, including Microsoft Corp and Netscape Communications Corp, oppose the export rules, which they say hamper sales abroad. And civil libertarians contend the export rules permit excessive governmental intrusions even within the United States.\nUnder the current policy, in effect since the beginning of 1997, the Clinton administration permits companies to export powerful encryption programs but only if the products allow the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys.  \nCompanies can export medium-strength encryption if they promise to incorporate so-called key recovery features within two years.\nThe committee is \"to advise on the range of issues of implementation of key recovery...not just the technical issues, but also law enforcement and access,\" Eckert said.\nThe administration was criticized by privacy advocates last month for drafting legislation that might allow easy government access to software keys without a court order.  \nWhile emphasizing that the committee was intended for law enforcement and corporate officials, Eckert said no groups would be excluded.\n\"We haven't excluded anybody,\" she said. \"That's why we published a notice in the Federal Register and advised everyone and anyone who's interested to submit their comments and suggestions.\"  \nThe members of the committee will be selected by the Secretary of Commerce \"to assure a balanced representation among the exporting community and those government agencies with a mandate to implement policy regarding encryption,\" the notice indicated.\nEckert declined to predict when the committee would be appointed, but added \"hopefully within a period of a couple of months it will be up and established.\"  \nThe administration will not wait for the committee to rejigger its export policy on several fronts, Eckert said. A modest revision of current export rules will be issued \"in a relatively short period,\" Eckert said, and a legislative proposal \"in the next several weeks.\"\nThe advisory committee would have input on future revisions, Eckert said.\nOpponents of the current policy said on Friday they continued to favor a legislative solution. Several bills are pending in Congress that would dramatically relax the export limits.\n\"This subcommittee is not a bad thing, but it does not change the nature of the debate,\" Business Software Alliance spokeswoman Kim Willard said. \"We still favor legislation.\"\n((202-898-8312))\n", "First Bank System Inc. said Thursday it will acquire U.S. Bancorp  in a stock deal worth more than $8.5 billion that will make it the 14th-largest bank in the United States and give it a firm toehold in the Pacific Northwest.\nThe deal between Minneapolis-based First Bank and U.S. Bancorp, a regional bank based in Portland, Ore., will also result in the loss of about 4,000 jobs, the banks said.\nUnder a definitive agreement, U.S. Bancorp shareholders will receive in a tax-free exchange 0.755 share of First Bank common stock for each U.S. Bancorp share they own.\nBased on First Bank's trading price of $75.375 Thursday, which was down $2.875, the purchase price equals $56.91 a share for holders of U.S. Bancorp, whose shares jumped $6.75 to $55.\n\"This is very rich pricing,\" said James Schutz at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp., noting the deal values U.S. Bancorp at about 19.2 times its 1996 earnings.\nHowever, First Bank Chief Executive John Grundhofer's reputation for aggressive cost-cutting, the complementary fit of U.S. Bancorp with First Bank's mostly Midwestern markets and the rich price of bank stocks in general made the deal palatable to many analysts.\n\"You could live a couple of lifetimes without finding another fit this good,\" Grundhofer said in a statement announcing the deal.\n\"It's a natural fit for them,\" said Frank Barkocy, analyst at Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross. \"It's a natural extension of their marketplace.\"\nFirst Bank said it expected pretax cost savings of about $340 million from the merger, with combined operating expenses being reduced by 14 percent.\nFirst Bank said it would take pretax charges of $625 million for costs related to the merger, which was expected to close by the end of June.\nWhile it was too soon to say specifically which jobs would be cut in the merger, the majority of jobs affected will be in the Portland area, bank officials said. Both banks have instituted hiring freezes to help minimize the number of people losing jobs, the banks said.\nFirst Bank said the deal was expected to add to its earnings per share starting in the second quarter of next year. By 1999, First Bank sees about an 8 percent addition to earnings per share.\nFirst Bank said it would be able to increase revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp's extensive corporate base.\nHome equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp's customers, while U.S. Bancorp's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers, the banks said.\n\"Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines,\" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group.\nGrundhofer will be president and chief executive of the new company, which will take the U.S. Bancorp name but remain based in Minneapolis.\nU.S. Bancorp Chairman Gerry Cameron will serve as chairman of the merged bank until his retirement in 1998.\nSince 1991, First Bank has made 23 acquisitions, including the $717 million acquisition of Nebraska-based FirsTier Financial Inc. in 1996.\nCameron said he was first approached by Grundhofer about a deal in early November.\n\"I frankly told him he should go talk to someone else that was interested,\" Cameron told reporters during a conference call. But he said he felt a responsibility to shareholders to hear Grundhofer out and the two discussed the deal around Thanskgiving.\nAfter subsequent meetings and a review that ended last weekend, both sides were even more convinced the deal made sense, he said.\n", "The bidding war for Conrail Inc. appears to be drawing to a close, but big legal and regulatory battles are right around the corner.\nIndustry analysts said Friday rival bidders CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. were unlikely to offer much more for Philadelphia-based Conrail, but both sides will pursue the fight elsewhere.\n\"That is the whole process that takes place over the course of 1997 -- the battle for market share as opposed to Conrail shares,\" said Anthony Hatch, analyst at NatWest Securities Corp.\nCSX, based in Richmond, Va., Thursday revised its friendly merger pact with Conrail to give shareholders an extra $870 million in the cash and stock transaction. Based on Friday's stock activity, the deal is worth $9.3 billion, or about $102 per Conrail share.\nA source close to CSX told Reuters Thursday that CSX and Conrail hoped the revised deal would end the bidding war.\nBut just hours after CSX and Conrail unveiled the new terms of their planned merger, rebuffed bidder Norfolk Southern increased its all-cash offer by $500 million to about $10.5 billion, or $115 per share.\n\"If someone were to start to bid higher than this, they probably wouldn't get the economies out of the deal to make it work so the bidding war, I think, has come to the end,\" said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group.\nAlthough Norfolk Southern's bid has been higher throughout the two-month takeover fight, Conrail contends the union with CSX is a better strategic fit.\nIndustry experts said Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, which has the financial power to bid more than $10.5 billion, merely wants to preserve the spread between the two offers while it fights a key aspect of the Conrail-CSX pact in court.\nNorfolk Southern is challenging part of the transaction that prohibits either CSX or Conrail from seeking another merger partner before 1999.\nNorfolk Southern last month lost a court fight in which it challenged previous terms of the deal, including a exclusivity provision that ruled out other talks before July 1997.\n\"This is a sign that they're not going to go bananaas (with a very high offer). If they're able to break the lock-up provision, they have a good bid,\" Hatch said.\n\"It was the right thing to do to keep pressure on the (Conrail) board,\" said one takeover stock trader, referring to investors who are unhappy with the Conrail board's decision to pursue the lower of the two bids.\nA hearing on the exclusivity provision is scheduled for Jan. 9 in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.\nFew security analysts were predicting the hearing's outcome, but the takeover fight for Conrail is expected to continue no matter which company wins in court.\nAfter the court fight, the next battle site will be Washington where the losing bidder is expected to vehemently challenge the merger. The deal already is expected to face intense scrutiny from the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that oversees railroads.\n\"You're going to have a lot of opposition to this,\" Vincent said, citing railroads, shippers and state agencies that are expected to express their opinions when the transaction reaches the regulatory stage.\nLast week, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it would intervene in any merger involving Conrail.\nConrail stock fell 75 cents to $100 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock lost 37.5 cents to $43.375 and Norfolk Southern shares rose 87.5 cents to $89.25, also on NYSE.\n", "Under pressure from President Bill Clinton to quit pitching hard liquor on the airwaves, the nation's distillers urged the president on Friday to gather the beer, wine and spirits industries together to develop a common advertising code.\nBut the White House showed little enthusiasm and the wine and beer industries rejected the move, scoffing at the suggestion that their products were similar to hard liquor.\n\"Common usage tells us all drinks are not the same,\" the Wine Institute said in a statement.\nThe Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), in a letter to Clinton, urged the president to use his \"bully pulpit\" and bring the industries -- along with broadcasters -- \"to the table\" to develop and adopt within 90 days a common code for alcohol ads.\nThe initiative came after Clinton asked the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday to study ways to prevent the hard liquor industry from selling its products over television and radio.\nThe hard-liquor industry last year abandoned a decades-old voluntary ban on such promotions, and Clinton called on the industry's executives to renew their moratorium.\n\"This code would set the same responsible standard for all beverage alcohol advertising and would provide uniform guidelines for the broadcasters,\" DISCUS President Fred Meister told a news conference, without going into specifics.\n\"This common code would send a strong message that alcohol is alcohol is alcohol,\" he said. DISCUS contended it was unfair to draw a distinction between advertising for hard liquor and for beer and wine, whose ads were not covered by the voluntary ban and have run on television and radio for decades.\nThe industry's voluntary ban has been in effect for TV ads since 1948 and radio ads since 1936.\nResponding to the liquor industry's proposal, a White House spokesman said: \"What the president is trying to do is prevent backsliding\" on the part of liquor companies.\nMeister declined to discuss details of what his industry would seek in a common code, saying he did not want to \"preempt the process.\" But beer and wine industry officials signalled they would have no part of such a process.\n\"There are obvious, significant differences between beer and hard liquor. For these reasons an advertising code covering both types of products is neither practical nor workable,\" the Beer Institute said in a statement.\nA spokeswoman for the National Association of Broadcasters said: \"We haven't seen any details on what they're asking for. \"Until we have a chance to see what exactly they're asking for and what's involved, we can't really respond.\"\n", "China has set up a special bureau to fight corruption, and the new organisation is empowered to tackle extreme cases involving the most senior officials, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.\nThe Special Case Investigation Section (SCIS) had been set up to to investigate more serious or extreme cases of corruption this year, Xinhua said, in a hint that Beijing may be ready to take on more high-ranking officials over graft.\nThe SCIS would target \"extremely severe legal cases and disciplinary offenses by officials at or above the department level in central government offices and those at or above the vice-governor level in local areas\", it quoted an official with the Supreme People's Procuratorate as saying.\nThe SCIS is part of the Law and Discipline Department of the Procuratorate.\n\"This has been a major step by the Procuratorate to make a breakthrough in solving cases of neglect of duty by state employees, or violations of citizens' rights, abuse of power, and other major crimes,\" the official said.\nThe SCIS was now organising a 50-member team and would start its work as soon as possible, he said.\nChina's procurators have said they face an uphill task to tackle corruption that has sprung up nationwide and at all levels of the Communist Party and government since paramount leader Deng Xiaoping launched his market reforms in 1978.\nHarsh penalties, including the death penalty in extremely large or high-level cases, have failed to deter greedy officials.\nCommunist Party chief Jiang Zemin has warned repeatedly that graft is a virus that could eventually topple the party if it is allowed to spread unchecked.\nIt was not clear whether the new task force would be empowered to take on the case of disgraced former Beijing municipal party boss, Chen Xitong, who has been under investigation since April, 1995 for suspected corruption.\nIn 1995, Chen became the first member of the ruling Politburo to be sacked for corruption since the 1949 communist takeover. He has yet to be charged.\nA former colleague, Beijing vice-mayor Zhang Baifa said last month that Chen could face disciplinary action for alleged dereliction of duty but was unlikely to face charges of graft.\nChen's case had been one of the most difficult, China's top corruption official said last year, describing the problems of fighting graft in the face of powerful interference.\nChen and his associates had prepared well for investigation, changing bank accounts, altering contracts and making sure their testimony was consistent, Luo Ji, director of the Supreme People's Procuratorate's General Anti-Corruption and Bribery Administration said.\nOfficial graft was almost unknown in China under the authoritiarian rule of the late Chairman Mao Zedong, but has boomed as Deng's reforms have opened up loopholes in the system and unprecedented opportunities for officials to profit from their positions.\nChen's departure from power came only after Beijing vice-mayor Wang Baosen committed suicide after coming under investigation in a $37 million corruption scam.\n", "The Czech government gave its final approval on Wednesday to a 20-year contract for natural gas supplies from Norway, ending total dependence on Russian gas, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said.\n\"The government today gave its final approval to the Norwegian option of diversifying imports of natural gas including the diversification of the transport route,\" Dlouhy told a news conference after a cabinet meeting.\nThe deal, approved by Czech and Norwegian ministers last month, angered officials at Russia's gas company RAO Gazprom which called the move economically unjustified.\nFinancial details have not been disclosed, but the Norwegian gas is expected to cost more than Russian supplies.\nA consortium of Norwegian firms, including Statoil, Norsk Hydro ASA and Saga Petroleum A/S, is involved in the deal, though Norway must still decide which gas producing platforms will supply the Czechs.\nUnder the deal which begins on May 1, supplies would start at 1.4 million cubic metres a day, increasing to about three billion cubic metres annually.\nThe total supply as laid out by the agreement should be 53 billion cubic metres (bcm) over 20 years.\nThe Norwegian gas is to be delivered through a pipeline via northern Germany which feeds into the Czech Republic.\nCzechs, who for the past half century have taken all of their natural gas from Russia, now consume around nine bcm of gas per year. Total consumption is expected to rise to 12-13 bcm after the turn of the century.\nRussia's Gazprom is still expected to remain the main supplier to the Czechs, but Gazprom officials said last month the Norwegian incursion could hurt Gazprom's competitive position in Europe.\n\"Gazprom is closely following the development of events in the Czech Republic, and remaining its fundamental partner in the field of gas supplies, will do everything possible to widen co-operation,\" Gazprom said.\nPrague said it picked Norway after considering potential deals with German, Dutch and British suppliers, as well as a second delivery route of Russian gas.\nThe deal also signals an expected push in the sector by Norway into central and eastern Europe. Statoil officials said at an initialling of the agreement last month in Prague that it was also looking to supply Poland and Hungary with natural gas.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003\n", "Australian-based pallet hire and logistics group Brambles Industries Ltd loaded up another strong first-half profit rise on Friday, but was quick to warn investors not to expect such strength in the second half.\nBrambles chief executive John Fletcher said slow European and Australian economies, along with a smaller boost from lower net interest costs, would slow growth in the second half.\nFletcher told Reuters analysts should not get too excited by a better-than-expected first-half result and should hold on to the full-year profit forecasts they made before the result.\n\"The message is that the existing market expectations for the full year that were there before this announcement, they're still looking okay,\" Fletcher said.\nHe said the average of the Barceps survey of analysts' forecasts for the 1996/97 year to June 30 was A$240.3 million (US$186.2 million)\nThis would be a near 12 percent rise for the full year on the A$214.8 million pre-abnormal net profit posted in 1995/96.\nEarlier, Brambles reported its first-half net profit before abnormals rose 14.8 percent to A$117.2 million.\nThere were no abnormal profits or losses in the period.\nBrambles also raised its dividend to 35 cents a share from 34 cents.\nFletcher said the higher profit reflected strong growth in North America and higher earnings despite difficult conditions in Australia and Europe.\nRevenue fell A$145 million to A$1.454 billion in the half.\n\"Lower net interest resulting from the proceeds of the sale of under-performing activities in Australia and Europe, and lower interest rates, also contributed to the overall improvement,\" Fletcher said.\nNet interest expenses fell to A$22.3 million from A$32.3 million in the half because debt was repaid after asset sales.\nBrambles said its Australian units continued to perform sluggishly overall, \"with little evidence of an improvement in those areas of the economy in which the company operates\".\nSubdued economic conditions in continental Europe continued to affect growth from Brambles' European activites, it said.\n\"But this was offset by the good gains achieved by the CHEP (pallet hire) and Cleanaway joint ventures,\" Brambles said.\nBrambles' CHEP joint venture is with Britain's GKN Plc.\nBrambles said it experienced good profit growth from its U.S. activities.\nEarnings before interest, tax and abnormals at U.S. operations rose to A$26.2 million in the half from A$17.8 million in the same period a year earlier.\n\"If only I had three Americas,\" Fletcher said.\nBrambles said it was talking to General Electric Capital and General Electric Plastics about the supply and leasing of plastic pallets in the United States and Europe.\nIt said it had worked with various parties on the development of a plastic pallet, but had yet to find a pallet as strong, durable or cheap as wood.\nFletcher told Reuters that Brambles was a lot closer to finding an acceptable plastic pallet this year than in previous years. \"We could be within 12 months of finding something,\" he said.\nBrambles shares closed unchanged on Friday at A$21.70, after having earlier risen to an intra-day high of A$21.94.\n(A$ = US$0.77)\n", "America Online Inc. was hit with two more lawsuits Wednesday from frustrated subscribers, and the world's largest online service also suffered a computer glitch that led it to shut down half of its system for nearly four hours.\nLate Wednesday, AOL's system suffered a partial outage when system problems led it to shut down half of its system from 3:45 p.m. EST until about 7:30 p.m. to find the problem.\n\"The system was able to accommodate 124,000 subscribers,\" an AOL spokeswoman said. Normally AOL, which has more than 7 million subscribers, accommodates about 258,000 users simultaneously.\nThe problem was with an interface board in a router device, which manages the flow of data in a network, the company said. AOL said its network was back to full capacity by 8 p.m. EST.\nThe spokeswoman said the outage was not related to the onslaught of member usage since AOL switched to unlimited use for a flat rate of $19.95 a month.\nAOL suffered another much more massive network outage in August last year, when the entire AOL network was down for almost 19 hours due to a software glitch.\nThat outage drew front-page headlines around the world, as millions of users were unable to access electronic mail, the Internet, and a variety of services and publications online, for almost a day.\nWhile AOL said the latest network outage was not due to the influx of users, the current demand for its service is clearly testing the patience of some subscribers, who have begun filing lawsuits against AOL.\nOn Wednesday, two more lawsuits were disclosed, both filed in New York state court this week, claiming breach of contract, deceptive trade practices and false advertising.\nThose suits came on the heels of a class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles on behalf of five subscribers, seeking damages for what they call fraudulent and malicious representation.\nIn addition, at least two state attorneys general have confirmed they are in discussions with America Online, seeking some resolution to complaints they have received from consumers about the continuing problem of network access.\nNew York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco and Wisconsin state Attorney General Jim Doyle are in discussions with AOL, spokesmen said.\nSince AOL switched its more than 7 million members to unlimited access for $19.95 a month, its network has been deluged by subscribers, many of whom cannot log onto the system during peak evening hours or on weekends.\nThe spokeswoman for the Dulles, Va.-based company could not immediately comment on the New York lawsuits, but on Tuesday, AOL said it was upgrading its network and that it understood its users' frustration.\n\"Although we understand the frustration some members are experiencing ... the average AOL member gets more value under unlimited pricing than ever before,\" AOL said in response to the Los Angeles lawsuit.\nMany Wall Street and industry analysts said they are not worried about the lawsuits, which they consider frivolous.\n", "Tiny Scottish research company Shield Diagnostics Plc said on Monday it had moved closer to marketing a potentially world-beating test for predicting heart attacks and coronary heart disease.\nShield said studies showed that patients with coronary heart disease had 30 percent higher levels of a key clotting agent, Activated Factor Twelve (AFT), in their blood than healthy people.\nDundee-based Shield has developed the only known test for AFT, the first element in a cascade of reactions in the blood which can eventually result in heart attacks and heart disease.\nIt believes this will prove a much more accurate indicator of both conditions than the 500 million pounds worth of cholesterol tests taken every year.\nShares in Shield closed 40 pence higher at 690 pence, to show a net gain of 393 percent since the start of the year.\nHowever, they continued to trade below the all-time peak of 928 pence reached just before news of problems with a patient-monitoring trial in the United States unnerved some investors on March 14.\nThe company says problems with the U.S. trial, which has monitored incidence of heart atacks in 16,000 people for more than a decade, would not affect the timetable for launching a general screening test and a simple test kit for use in doctor's surgeries.\nShield said it planned to make the test itself and then license it out on a semi-exclusive basis to large diagnostic companies and to drug companies who would use it to promote their products.\nTalks with diagnostics companies, believed to include Abbott Laboratories Inc, are already under way.\nShield declined to predict sales for the test but said it could save health services and insurers hundreds of millions of pounds a year through earlier detection and prevention.\nChief executive officer Gordon Hall said caring for patients with cardiac disase in the United States alone cost $151 billion a year, including $118 billion on hospital care.\n\"Any process than can reduce this figure must be highly attractive to healthcare providers ...if five percent of cases were detected earlier and prevented, then over $7.5 billion could be saved,\" Hall said.\nFor now Shield is more than content to have its eye not just on the 500 million pound annual cholesterol test market but on a further 380 million pounds spent on other tests related to cardiovascular disease.\nYamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum, a long-standing supporter of Shield, said he calculates that every one percent gain in Shield's share of the cholesterol testing market is worth 60 million pounds on its market capitalization. Even after its price surge this year, the group is worth around 130 million pounds.\nHowever, Shield continued to try to dampen more feverish expectations about the test's prospects on Monday.\n\"All we can say is that if you have high AFT, you are a high risk (of a heart attack),\" said technical director Peter Foster. \"We can't say that if you have low AFT there is no risk -- there may be other reasons (for a heart attack).\"\nShield's caution may also stem from press and market criticism in recent week of the way it has handled news about the product.\nOne industry specialist said many investors had not been getting a straight story on the AFT test, leading to the share's underperformance last year.\nThe company ran into trouble in January when it published a newsletter on AFT which was not initially sent to the stock exchange. The newsletter sparked a sharp rise in the group's share price.\n", "Nextwave Telecommunications Inc., an ambitious newcomer among the giants of the wireless world, is to re-file for its delayed initial public offering in the next two weeks, a source close to the company said Monday.\nAn unknown in the industry until it began bidding in 1996's C-band Personal Communications Services (PCS) auctions, Nextwave has spent a staggering $4.7 billion on wireless licenses for the third largest network in the United States.\nThe company planned to go public last summer, but after a series of delays finally came to a parting with lead manager Merrill Lynch in the fall.

Wednesday reported a $9 million third-quarter profit, compared with a year-ago loss of $69 million.\nThe results, equal to 2 cents a share, slightly exceeded Wall Street analysts' consensus expectation that the Troy, Mich.-based retailer would break even during the August-October period.\nNevertheless, Kmart stock closed down 62.5 cents at $10.50 on the New York Stock Exchange after Chairman Floyd Hall dismissed rumours that Kmart was the target of a possible takeover by leveraged buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.\nThe rumours drove Kmart's stock up $1.625 on Tuesday.\nSpeaking to reporters at the opening of Kmart's second Manhattan store, Hall said he has not heard from KKR.\n\"As far as we know, they are all rumours,\" he said.\nIn a statement accompanying the third-quarter results, Hall said Kmart is \"beginning to see meaningful progress toward a recovery.\"\n\"Our biggest challenge of the year lies just ahead in the fourth quarter, and we remain cautiously optimistic about our near-term outlook,\" he added.\nBut sales growth has been a tough challenge since Hall was hired to rebuild Kmart in June 1995.\nKmart's total revenues for the quarter fell 1.6 percent from last year to $7.85 billion. Company-wide same-store sales rose 0.1 percent from a year ago and same-store sales for U.S. Kmart stores increased 0.8 percent.\nHall said revenues did not meet the company's growth expectations for the period, but savings from store closings, contracting out of certain functions and other costs cuts have resulted in a $370 million reduction in Kmart's year-to-date selling, general and administrative expenses.\nBut Kmart's gross margin rate for the third quarter increased to 22.6 percent of sales from 21.2 percent last year, reflecting fewer markdowns to clear aged inventory and a lower level of overall promotional activity, Kmart said.\nAnalysts said the slow sales growth suggests that Kmart is still losing market share to archrivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. But they were pleased with Kmart's 8 percent reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period.\n\"If you compare it with last year, the company is making considerable progress. The part of the equation that remains is to get the sales up,\" said Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Joseph Ronning.\nKmart executives told analysts in a conference call that they expect better sales results in the near future from their apparel offerings -- particularly children's clothing -- and the \"pantry concept\" stores, which offer several aisles of attractively priced consumable items such as soft drinks and snacks just inside the front entrance.\nKmart now has about 180 pantry concept stores in the United States and will change 450 stores to the new format annually for the next couple of years.\nHall also told reporters that Kmart is aiming for a 3.5 percent to 5 percent increase in same-store sales for the all-important holiday selling period. Kmart could achieve a 6-7 percent increase, Hall said. But he cautioned that he didn't want to sacrifice profit margins to achieve that figure.\nStill, he said analysts' estimates that Kmart will earn a profit of $165.5 million for the fourth quarter ending in January 1997 were \"reasonable.\"\nKmart, the second largest retailer in the United States, operates 2,143 Kmart and 168 Builders Square retail outlets, and operates 129 stores internationally.\n", "Two members of Congress criticised the Federal Reserve Thursday for what they called its \"woefully inadequate\" record of hiring and promoting women and minorities.\nRepresentative Henry Gonzalez and Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., in a letter to Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, said several discrimination lawsuits against the bank \"show a clear need for reform.\"\nThe letter paired persistent Fed critic Gonzalez, a Democrat from Texas serving his 19th term in Congress, with second-term Illinois Democrat Jackson, son of the well-known civil rights leader.\nA Fed spokesman declined comment.\nOne of the lawsuits, filed against the central bank in January by four black secretaries, may be expanded as 15 other current and former employees have asked to join the litigation, the two Democratic lawmakers said.\n\"As one of the nation's primary banking regulators, the Federal Reserve should serve as a model for the banking system it regulates,\" the two wrote to Greenspan.\n\"Despite being at the forefront in carrying out the nation's laws, we are concerned that the Federal Reserve's record of diversity in hiring and promotion is woefully inadequate.\"\nThe four black secretaries filed suit Jan. 21 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of themselves and \"all others similarly situated.\"\nA black Fed researcher won a similiar suit against the bank in 1994, the Congressmen noted.\nGonzalez and Jackson asked Greenspan to assess the validity of the complaints and report if any action has been taken to address the alleged problems.\nThey did commend the central bank for increasing the number of women and minorities among the most highly paid Fed employees over the past three years.\nIn 1993, only one woman and one non-white were among the 35 top paid staff earning more than $125,000. Now, with 72 people making that much, 11 are women and five are minorities.\nThe hiring of additional women \"is an important step in ending what appeared to be gender bias in the selection of top staff, but it is still below comparable government standards which are also too low,\" Gonzalez and Jackson said. Minority representation \"remains poor.\"\n", "Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier Plc said on Wednesday that currency factors were likely to depress this year's earnings after the company recorded an 11 percent profit rise in 1996.\nReed Elsevier co-chairman Nigel Stapleton told Reuters the strength of sterling would, if maintained, \"drag down\" headline earnings by five percent this year. Earnings figures for the combined businesses of Reed Elsevier are expressed in sterling.\nPre-tax profits in 1996 rose to 805 million pounds ($1.3 billion) from 723 million on turnover from continuing operations up to 3.38 billion pounds from 3.21 billion. Share analysts had forecast profits of between 808 and 821 million pounds.\nAnalysts said that the strong pound was likely to restrict earnings growth to single figures this year and they mentioned a likely profit figure of around 870 million pounds.\nReed International Plc, the British arm of the business, proposed a two-for-one share split to take effect in May.\nLondon-listed Reed shares were down 18-1/2 pence to 1,155p at 1520 GMT, while Elsevier NV shares in Amsterdam dipped 1.10 guilders to 31.40.\nAnalysts said the company's performance had fallen slightly short of expectations and that Reed shares had risen more than 10 percent over the last two months on bid speculation.\nFor shareholders in Reed the full-year dividend was raised by 11 percent to 27.2 pence per share. Elsevier shareholders will receive 0.76 guilders per share, a 29 percent increase.\nThe company noted that currency conversions meant that Elsevier results and dividends were helped in guilder terms.\n\"It's good news for Elsevier and bad for Reed,\" said co-chairman Stapleton. \"(But) the two share prices are linked so much that Elsevier should pull Reed up with it in some respects.\"\nStapleton said the 1996 figures reflected a \"solid performance\" right across the group. They followed a four percent earnings dilution resulting from the company's 1995 consumer business divestment programme.\nReed Elsevier sold consumer businesses, such as local newspapers, in order to focus on the provision of information in fields like science, business and the legal profession.\nStapleton said a \"big deal\" such as Reed's $1.5 billion purchase of U.S. on-line information supplier LEXIS-NEXIS in 1994 would be \"nice but not necessary\".\nHis co-chairman Herman Bruggink told analysts in Amsterdam that Lexis-Nexis was stepping up its efforts to expand outside its U.S. base and targeting Europe in particular.\nReed International said its proposed share split would be put to the vote at its annual general meeting in April, to take effect the following month.\nIt gave no reason for the split, but companies often opt to split their stock in the belief that the process makes their shares more liquid or tradeable.

Since March, Eurotunnel had broken even at the operating level before financial charges and after operating expenses and capital expenditure.\nFrench co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said this proved it was economically viable but needed to lighten the debt burden.\nBut the British and French co-chairmen differed over the timing of a deal to refinance 72 billion francs ($14 billion) of debt and unpaid interest owed to its 225-member bank syndicate.\nEurotunnel has been in bank talks since it froze payments on its junior-ranked loans a year ago, after it undershot cash targets in 1995. A mandate for two mediators named by a Paris court to help negotiations expires at the end of September.\nPonsolle told reporters he hoped for an agreement by the end of September, while his British counterpart, Alistair Morton, told Reuters in London he was allowing eight weeks to reach an accord with bankers.\n\"Our aim is still to reach an agreement on September 30,\" Ponsolle told reporters. He said there was a \"near-consensus\" on the instruments and the structure for the debt-restructuring. But the key question of sharing out the rewards remained.\n\"What is still being discussed is the division of pain and the hope of gains between shareholders and lenders,\" he said.\nMorton said: \"I reckon there's about eight hours of serious negotiation left to do, so I've allowed eight weeks for it. The banks have got plenty of time to get their act together and come to the table,\" he said.\nMorton, who has said he would resign when the debt talks were completed, said he will step down at the end of October.\nEurotunnel's talks have been deadlocked over how much the banks should get out of the company's cash flow to repay debts and the amount that should go to shareholders who have seen their shares plummet.\nPonsolle said Eurotunnel had always been sold as a long-term investment -- it was floated in 1987 and the first dividend was planned for 2004 -- and it would be unfair if the banks were get the rewards just as it started making money.\nEurotunnel decided to reward shareholders' patience with discounts on the company's Le Shuttle trains and the Eurostar high-speed rail system, he said.\nEurotunnel was headed for a 50 percent sales increase this year, on its 1995 turnover of 2.3 billion francs ($452 million), despite an expected slowing in sales in the second half of 1996, Ponsolle said.\nThe company has provisioned 3.7 billion francs ($727 million) for interest due on its bank debt but unpaid since it froze payments on Sept. 14, 1995.\n", "Shares in British media group EMAP Plc tumbled about three percent on Monday after the company said it was losing managing director David Arculus to television and newspaper firm United News &amp; Media .\nArculus, 50, who joined EMAP in 1972, will move to United News on April 7 as chief operating officer. His responsibilites there will range from consumer publishing through television to trade magazines and exhibitions.\n\"David Arculus has demonstrated a sure touch as a builder of media businesses. His experience and proven record make him a valuable addition to the team,\" United chief executive Clive Hollick said.\nUnited said the move completed the management team it has built since its three billion pound ($4.9 billion) merger with television and financial services group MAI last year.\nUnited shares rose 17p to 704.5p after the announcement while EMAP fell 25p to 787.5p.\nEMAP has been one of Britain's fastest growing businesses in recent years, selling out of its original regional newspaper base, and expanding its British local radio operations and its consumer magazine interests at home and in France.\nBut it was hit last year by a row over corporate governance which resulted in the ousting of two non-executive directors.\nChairman Sir John Hoskyns at that time played down talk of a boardroom rift between Arculus and chief executive Robin Miller over who would succeed him.\nShare analysts said the departure of Arculus was worrying, coming so soon after last year's upheaval.\n\"The fact that Arculus is leaving is slightly disturbing,\" said Nick Ward of Credit Lyonnais Laing, noting however that it was impossible for a company to predict staff changes.\n\"But the place will not fall apart without him,\" Ward added, saying that EMAP was known for its strong divisional management.\nAnalysts also pointed out that the fall in EMAP shares came after a strong run which has seen them rise from 730p in December when the non-executive directors were removed.\nEMAP's Miller said the company's board had not yet decided on who will succeed chairman Hoskyns when he retires next year.\nMiller, who joined EMAP in 1965 as a reporter on Motor Cycle News, said there had been differences with Arculus but the partnership had worked well overall.\nArculus, EMAP managing director since 1990, said he was delighted to be joining United, a company whose businesses include British commercial television stations, two national newspapers and a trade exhibitions arm.\n\"I got offered a job about three times the size of the one I was doing at EMAP,\" Arculus told Reuters.

He rejected fresh reports about the mysterious death of its chief geologist at Busang.\nWhile Canadian regulators probe Bre-X and its top officials for possible violation of insider trading and disclosure laws, lawyers in Canada and the United States are forging ahead with at least eight class action lawsuits.\n\"The last two weeks have been an unprecedented bout of stress and workload. I don't thing anyone in this company has been under the microscope like this,\" said Walsh, who needed occasional prompting from Bre-X officials during a telephone interview with Reuters.\n\"We have more than sufficient resources to weather the storm,\" Walsh said.\nBre-X has been in the eye of the storm since preliminary tests by its partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc on the Busang gold property indicated the deposit may contain \"insignificant\" amounts of gold.\nThe announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion), or more than 80 percent, from the company's stock market value.\nBre-X firmed C40 cents to close at C$2.67 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday,\nWalsh said an independent audit of the Busang project by Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. would confirm Bre-X's estimate of 71 million ounces of gold, potentially the richest in the world.\n\"We're sticking by our numbers that we have announced so I don't really want to speculate. What happens if they come in at 80 million (ounces of gold)? I'm not really going to speculate on that,\" he said.\nWalsh declined to confirm reports that the Busang partners would receive the test results on April 29. \"We're saying hopefully the first week of May. So we're splitting hairs. I don't think one can be given an exact date because of the procedure Strathcona is going to be utilizing.\"\nThe newly drilled core samples to be used in the audit are under tight security and will transported to Perth, Australia by chartered jet, Walsh said. Three independent labs will conduct tests of the core samples in three countries.\nStrathcona was hired by Bre-X immediately after it received the preliminary findings from Freeport.\nBre-X's chief Busang geologist, Michael de Guzman, was en route to a meeting with Freeport officials on March 19 when he fell out of a helicopter in an apparent suicide.\nThe death of a co-discoverer of Busang, coupled with leaked reports in the Indonesian press about Freeport's findings, sparked a selloff in Bre-X shares the following day.\nThe geologist's death has been the subject of wild rumors and media reports, including an Indonesian newspaper article on Thursday suggesting the corpse buried at de Guzman's funeral last week in the Philippines was not de Guzman.\nWalsh said he still believed de Guzman committed suicide. But he added: \"We have not received official autopsy reports and we have no comment on Mike's tragic death.\"\nBre-X's head of exploration, John Felderhof, has assumed de Guzman's responsibilities at Busang, but the company officials in Calgary have had trouble communicating with him.\n\"We've had very little communication with him. For some reason our satellite communication is not functioning properly and faxes that come out are garbled,\" Walsh said.\nWith billions of dollars in limbo and Strathcona's report weeks away, financial markets have been awash with theories that tampering occurred with the Busang drilling samples.\nBut Walsh said a step-by-step report of Bre-X's sampling and assay methods released on Wednesday would quash speculation that the samples were tampered with at the site.\nBut some analysts said the focus was shifting toward the assay method used.\n\"That is highly unlikely considering the credibility of the lab (PT Indo Assay), which has been in existence for a number of years and used by major mining companies in the country,\" Walsh responded.\nHe declined to comment on increasing attention being paid to personal trades by himself, his wife and other company officials, which netted them about C$77 million ($55 million).\nThe Ontario Securities Commission is probing Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws.\nSome trades by Walsh and others in 1996 were controversial because they occurred shortly after Bre-X learned that its preliminary license had been canceled by Indonesia, something the company did not make public until last October.\nWalsh said he considered the revoked license \"non-material information\" because Bre-X's claim to Busang was in good standing. \"At no time was the ground not legally held and the revocation was a non-material fact,\" he said.\nThe Indonesian military is closely watching the testing at Busang and the government has announced plans to investigate.\nWalsh said the controversy would not threaten Bre-X's 45 percent stake in the project because it has a binding agreement with its partners. \"We see absolutely no reason for any further changes. What's going right now is not of our making and there is no reason there would be any changes to the binding agreement,\" he said.\n", "China has set realistic targets in its 1997 budget but analysts said on Sunday that debt-ridden state-owned enterprises and high unemployment remain thorns in the government's side.\nA 1997 budget deficit target of 57 billion yuan ($6.87 billion), was, at less than one percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a \"very healthy level and good for a developing country,\" said Hoong Yik-Luen, head of China research at ING-Barings.\nFinance Minister Liu Zhongli, in his budget report on Sunday, announced a 7.2 percent cut in the budget deficit from 61.442 billion yuan in 1996, which was itself 10.8 percent below target.\n\"Very few countries in the world today have a budget deficit around one percent of GDP,\" Hoong said.\n\"If you look at the United States, it is probably three to four percent, so they (China) are doing better in terms of budget deficit control than a lot of First World countries,\" he said.\nThe government's use of domestic bond issues was a clever and thoughtful way of soaking up China's surplus cash for domestic investment, he said.\nChina issued a total of 196.742 billion yuan in debt last year, 1.485 billion yuan above the targeted figure and an increase of 27 percent over 1995.\nThe 1997 target for domestic and overseas debt announced by Finance Minister Liu is 248.596 billion yuan ($29.95 billion), up 27.3 percent on the 1996 figure.\nOne analyst in Shanghai said government authorities \"are realising there is a lot of money domestically\" as bank deposits far outstripped bank loans.\nBy issuing domestic bonds -- though minute in value compared to developed countries that issue domestic and international debt -- the government was able to soak liquidity back into the system.\n\"If you look at the fact that all the bond issues were sold to domestic investors, then basically it is not an external debt problem,\" Hoong said.\n\"It is actually recycling domestic savings and moving the money from people's hands, preventing them from spending and thereby accelerating inflation, and bringing that money back to the government,\" he said. \"Then the government relies on domestic savings to invest domestically.\"\nAnother analyst in Shanghai said one reason for the popularity of bonds was the lack of investment alternatives.\n\"One of the reasons that bank savings outstrip loans is because there is a lot of money in the system and people want to get some kind of return on it,\" she said.\n\"The other problem is that the lending rate is too low. The banks could be lending a lot more than they are and they could be doing it very productively if they were allowed to do their own lending,\" she said.\nThis was due in part to China's tight credit policy of the past few years, she said. While credit would probably be eased in 1997, bank deregulation was not on Beijing's agenda, she said.\nStability, however, was a top government priority, especially after the death last month of Deng Xiaoping, whose 18-year leadership steered China from Stalinist backwater to economic powerhouse, analysts said.\nAfter three years of belt-tightening aimed at slowing growth that threatened to spin out of control, China should now be concentrating on such pillars as infrastructure development to create jobs and kick-start the sluggish economy, they said.\nChina's estimated 100,000 state firms reported their first ever combined net loss in the first quarter of last year, but a banking source said the economy's reliance on them has fallen from 100 percent before 1979 to around 40 percent now.\nThe need to retrench up to 150 million people had been factored into the government's long-term economic policies, he said, and for the sake of stability could not be done overnight.\n\"It has to be done slowly,\" another of the bank analysts said. \"And we would prefer it to be slow because if it is too hasty it could result in some very unproductive mergers.\"\nShe and others put real national unemployment at close to 15 percent.\nThe 1997 target for urban unemployment unveiled in Sunday's budget was three percent. China's official urban unemployment rate was 2.9 percent at the end of the third quarter of 1996, with no figure available for all of 1996. Officials have said the figure could be around seven percent.\nAn inflation target of six percent for 1997 was realistic and achievable after 1996's 6.1 percent, Hoong of ING-Barings said.\n\"They have shown they feel comfortable with the inflation rate,\" he said. \"The question now is stability and stability will come if everyone has a job.\"\n", "Intel Corp. stock fell for the third straight day Friday on concerns that a series of upcoming price cuts could slow the company's momentum.\nThe stock tumbled $6.75 to $130.50, off a total of $16.125, or roughly 11 percent, since Tuesday.\nThe fall led the entire market lower, and analysts cited nervousness about Intel's first-quarter results, due after the market close on Monday. The earnings report will serve as a critical barometer of whether strong corporate earnings can keep underpinning stock values.\nIndustry analysts said Intel's quarterly price cuts on Pentium processors are expected to lead to slightly lower prices for personal computers. Some speculated that in expectation of rival chips, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s new K6, Intel will cut Pentium prices more than usual, from 25 percent to 30 percent.\n\"This continues to fuel normal PC demand,\" said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest Inc in San Jose, Calif. \"This is the normal stuff that keeps stimulating the market.\"\nAccording to First Call, which tracks Wall Street estimates, analysts expect Intel to report a first-quarter profit of $2.07 a share, up from $1.02 a year ago, when Intel posted net income of $894 million on revenues of $4.64 billion.\nIf Intel meets those expectations, it will be the second straight quarter in which the world's largest maker of computer chips has more than doubled its year-on-year profits.\nAn Intel spokesman said the company could not comment this close to its earnings report, but the company said in mid-March -- within two weeks of the close of the quarter -- that market fundamentals \"remain very strong.\"\nIntel executives told analysts in January they expect revenues to be around $6.4 billion, about even with what it reported in the fourth quarter. Gross margins -- the difference between revenue and the costs of goods -- are expected to be even with or below the fourth quarter's 63 percent.\nAnalysts said Intel's bellwether role -- it has recently made a habit of re-energising flagging stock markets with particularly upbeat earnings reports -- is especially crucial given Wall Street's current moodiness.\nWall Street is particularly wary of the outlook for corporate earnings following the Federal Reserve's March 25 decision to raise interest rates and fresh speculation about chances of another rate increase based on Friday's report of underlying price pressures at the wholesale level in March.\n\"People are scared. Intel is one of the biggest holdings and they can still sell it at a profit,\" said David Wu, high-tech analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. \"They're scared because tech stocks are going down. If technology stocks can't do corporate earnings, you can forget about the rest.\nAnalysts said the much-heralded \"whisper\" number for Intel is for it to make $2.15 a share, and that even $2.20 a share could be possible given another blow-out quarter.\nBut, one analyst cautioned, \"anything less than $2.15 would not be good\" for the market.\nMarket researcher Dataquest said last week that Intel will continue to dominate the personal computer industry, where its processors currently account for 95 percent of the market, although clone-makers will start to make inroads this year.\nIntel spokesman Howard High said Friday the company will continue with its routine quarterly pricing changes, but that he saw no unusual changes in the upcoming pricing pattern from that to which the PC industry has grown accustomed.\n\"We do our price declines in a pretty predictable, orderly fashion,\" he said.\nAnalysts expect Intel to cut some prices when it unveils its new high-end Pentium II chip next month, and High said Intel's practice is to \"move other products down a notch\" to make room for the new processors.\n\"The movement is always in a relatively consistent direction, which is down. The rate is dependent on market conditions ... They (the pricing reductions) seem to have been pretty constant over the years,\" he added.\nIn February, Intel's pricing changes for its Pentium and Pentium Pro family of microprocessors ranged from no change at all to roughly a 34 percent decline, he noted.\nIntel's processors range in price from around $100 for the lower-end, older models to over $1,000 for the highest-end chips.\n", "International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday introduced its next generation mainframe computer family, with systems twice as fast as currently available models, in a product launch widely anticipated by its customers.\n\"The feedback is phenomenal,\" said Ross Mauri, vice president of System 390 hardware developnment, in a phone interview. \"We have seen quite a bit of demand out there.\"\n\"Customers have been enthusiastic about embracing the new server,\" Mauri said, adding that it is likely that IBM will be \"sold out of what we can produce this year,\" based on the initial customer reaction.\nMainframes are giant computers that store the data of the biggest corporations around the world. They are used by banks for transactions, by airlines for reservations systems, and by insurance companies for claims processing.\nWhile many analysts have predicted the demise of these giant computers as more companies move to PC-based networks, mainframes have staged somewhat of a comeback as huge repositories of data that is accessible via the Internet and internal networks known as intranets.\nThe new mainframe servers use the third generation of IBM's lower-cost processor technology, called CMOS. The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology is a process that uses microprocessor technology that is less costly to build and less expensive for customers to maintain.\nIBM introduced two new lines of System 390 servers, or computers that manage networks.\nOne family, called the IBM S/390 Parallel Entreprise Server, has 13 models designed specifically for heavy data storage and for transaction intensive companies.\nThe second server line, the IBM S/390 Multiprise 2000, is aimed at medium-sized customers who are currently using IBM S/390 mainframes, but wish to increase their computing power. The Multiprise is also aimed at customers who wish to buy an entire package, with software and storage systems.\nSo far, IBM has installed about 14 of the S/390 Parallel Enterprise Servers - Generation 3 in an early customer program. IBM has also installed three of the S/390 Multiprise.\nIBM also said it introduced an upgrade of its mainframe operating system, called OS/390 Release 2, which provides more connectivity for customers to computer networks such as the Internet and UNIX based systems. IBM also introduced other software products for better network computing over the S/390.\nIBM also introduced new mainframe disk storage products for improved data reliabilty.\nIBM declined to give any price details on the new models, saying that it tailors each systems to unique customer needs and that customers are now familiar with the lower prices of CMOS-based mainframes.\n\"As you make the transition from bipolar to CMOS, you see a significant price reduction,\" said Mauri. \"Customers already have an understanding of that.\"\nBipolar refers to the process technology that IBM used in its older mainframe models. Three years ago, IBM began preparing its customers for a big transition to a new, lower-cost machine, designed around microprocessors.\nAnalysts said the new mainframes run at speeds of around 45 million instructions per second (MIPS), twice as fast as the currently available speeds of 22 million instructions per second for the fastest CMOS models, bringing the systems up to the speeds of the older bipolar machines, and at a lower cost.\nEven with the prices of these huge milllion dollar systems falling, mainframes are still IBM's biggest revenue producing hardware. Analysts are hoping for a big uptick in fourth quarter earnings, in part due to mainframes, because the lower-cost models are more profitable to IBM.\n\"These are all necessary announcements for IBM,\" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial Group analyst, adding that the products are important to IBM's future earnings.\nIBM said the new models will be available next month.\n\"The mainframe as we once knew it, where MIPS were expensive, we are never going to see that again,\" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. \"IBM has re-engineered the mainframe, they don't even want to call it a mainframe anymore, they call it a server.\"\n", "Modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp's stock soared Wednesday on talk that it may be close to unveiling a faster analog modem.\nSkokie, Illinois- based U.S. Robotics told an Oppenheimer &amp; Co investors conference Tuesday that it is looking at developing new technologies including higher speed modems.\nThe company has previously said that it did not believe 33.6 kilobits per second was the fastest speed for modems.\nWhile the company did not say whether it had developed a faster modem, an Oppenheimer analyst said the presentation on the subject was more elaborate than discussions on the topic in the past.\n\"This is the first time they've ever discussed this with some slides and everything,\" Oppenheimer analyst Steven Levy said.  \"To the extent there is one, it's probably not too far away.\"\nMeanwhile, Rockwell International Corp's semiconductor systems unit said late Tuesday it expects to demonstrate 56 kilobit transmission capabilities at a trade show in November.\nThat added to sentiment that such a modem, which would speed Internet communication over standard telephone lines, was more than just theory, analysts said.\nAnalysts said U.S. Robotics has about an 80 percent share of the modem market for online services and a 38 percent share for desktop modems that connect users with those services.\nIf U.S. Robotics can quickly market a faster modem, it could help the company hold or improve that share, as there is no standardization at the 56 kilobit level, analysts said. In other words, Rockwell and U.S. Robotics' modems don't \"talk\" to each other.\n\"Clearly we have an issue of standardization process that will take time and during that time, there's an opportunity for the company to be the only supplier,\" said Rakesh Sood, analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist.\nU.S. Robotics would not comment about whether it was close to releasing a faster modem. The stock was up 4-3/8 to 56-7/8 on Nasdaq Wednesday. Rockwell International stock rose 1/4 to 54-1/8 in NYSE trading.\nSood noted that modems are a far bigger part of U.S. Robotics' business than Rockwell International's.\n--Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787\n", "Russia's Norilsk Nickel mining and smelting company said on Thursday a cash crisis could tarnish its plans to become the world's top nickel producer in 1997.\nThe company had to cut costs, and to do that successfully it needed the government's cooperation.\nNorilsk, previewing of one of the puniest payouts yet seen in Russia's emerging market, also said its board would recommend at an annual shareholders meeting on Friday a 1996 privileged share dividend of just two roubles -- an infinitesimal sum in dollar terms and way below 1995's 438 roubles.\nNorilsk is a leading global producer of nickel and metals such as platinum and palladium. It aims to boost nickel output by 20 percent this year to 213,000 tonnes, taking advantage of idled capacity to become the world number one.\nBut Norilsk spokesman Sergei Vetchinin said the firm could be frustrated by cash problems that are reflected in a dividend structure which recommends no payout on ordinary shares for the second year running.\n\"Realisation of the 1997 production plan strongly depends on the decisions of the government with regard to our needs to cut costs,\" he said.\nNorilsk's production north of the Arctic Circle is profitable but vast expenses are pushing it into the red.\n\"We have a plan,\" Vetchinin said. \"We're not just crying...We are working to improve things.\"\nBut he added, \"If our costs do not come down, and that will take place by the state taking responsibility for our social costs, things may change.\"\nThe state holds 51 percent of voting shares in Norilsk, a stake entrusted temporarily to commercial bank Uneximbank, which is trying to revamp everything from Norilsk units' finances and export revenue flows to the cost of supporting pensioners.\nVetchinin said the board would vote on items that could affect the company's charter and Uneximbank would vote according to State Property Fund instructions, but he gave no details.\nAt the end of 1996, RAO Norilsky Nikel was owed 6.9 trillion roubles ($1.2 billion). It owed, through tax and other arrears, 16.9 trillion roubles, Vetchinin said.\nThis has helped make its flagship mining and metallurgical complex one of Russia's top debtors and a source of labour unrest that has in the past sent world metals markets gyrating.\nBut a company statement said workers were satisfied management was making progress in paying off wage and other arrears, which had been halved to six weeks, and that under a deal ending July 1, output would not be disrupted.\n\"The downhill slide has been halted and the proof is thus -- we have a team of managers, a programme and real resources for production,\" Vetchinin said, adding the government could sign a decree restructuring the company's debt as soon as next week.\nNorilsk, which has said it could be near bankruptcy after 1996 consolidated losses of 3.29 trillion roubles according to Russian accounting standards, likes to describe its problems as social and political, not economic and financial.\nBut some of its problems stem from market, not state, relations. Vetchinin said Norilsk wanted its natural gas supplier to cut its rates, not supplies, as it has since early June, forcing Norilsk to run partly on heavy fuel oil.\nRussia also accounts for about 60 percent of the world's palladium supply and around 20 percent of platinum deliveries, with Norilsk accounting for most of Russian production.\n\"If you look at our production as separate from our other costs, it's profitable,\" Vetchinin said. The main complex's profit margins on nickel, used to manufacture stainless steel, were 18 percent, he added.\n\"But we want to tell our own state that if we don't get rid of our expenses, then our metal will cease to be competitive on world markets after 2000.\" ($1 = 5,760 roubles)\n", "Indium, one of the few minor metals to survive the end of the Cold War with demand intact, is now in short supply as Chinese producers have either oversold or are hoarding stocks as prices soar, traders said on Friday.\nTraders in China and Japan, the world's biggest consumer of indium, said Chinese producers seemed unwilling to sell at current prices, instead waiting for further rises.\nIndium, a by-product of zinc, is used in the manufacture of semi-conductors and liquid crystal displays (LCD).\nChina is Asia's biggest producer, according to one trading source.\nJapan uses about two-thirds of annual world supply, with 80 percent of that used to make LCDs, a Tokyo market source said.\nJapanese consumption slumped 38 percent in 1996 to 43.5 tonnes, pressuring on prices, he said.\nBut with an improved economic outlook and a revival in the high-end electronics industry, indium demand is picking up and world supply is tightening.\nFigures for China's annual output are not available. One trader said it is not a major world supplier of indium but in a tight market its output counted.\n\"Chinese producers have sold out, in effect they have oversold, so I don't think we will see anything available before late April/early May,\" a Chinese trader in Beijing said.\n\"Chinese producers are now looking for $290 a kg,\" on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, he said.\nThe price for 99.99 percent indium ingot was quoted in Rotterdam last week at $220/250 a kg.\nChinese indium is arriving in Japan at $280-300 a kg, inclusive of cost, insurance and freight (CIF), the Tokyo trader said.\nFar East traders said they have been waiting for spot prices for indium to hit $300 a kg, as there was no perceptible pickup in Chinese production after the Lunar New Year holiday in February.\nA European source in Hong Kong said he recently bought a few hundred kg of indium in the belief that prices are on their way back up to the levels of two years ago, close to $500 a kg.\n\"The market has seen those levels before and is not afraid of them,\" he said.\nThe Chinese trading source said that Chinese factories were now shipping against old contracts but were asking for a premium over the contracted price.\nOther traders said long-term contracts were being delayed, with some reporting that Chinese suppliers were attempting to re-negotiate prices.\nSome suppliers were also reneging, they said.\n\"We have had that experience,\" a source at a Western company said.\n\"So in this atmosphere people are very wary and we are still pushing for our own deliveries,\" he said.\nAnother Chinese trader said there were sources of indium in China and Hong Kong but these were unlikely to seep into the market until prices firmed more dramatically.\n\"When the price rose to $400-500 a kg in 1995, a lot of Chinese companies were thinking it would go as high as $700 and they bought a lot of material at $400,\" the source said.\n\"Some of them are still holding, waiting for the price to go up again so they can clear their books,\" he said.\n\"So there is material and we will see some come out but there won't be a flood because producers have oversold, they will want to clear their old contracts first.\n\"In the meantime, there are a lot of people knocking on our door looking for indium,\" he said.\n", "First Bank System Inc is seen paying a premium price to expand its geographic footprint to the Pacific Northwest with its planned $9 billion acquisition of Portland, Oregon-based U.S. Bancorp.\n\"This is very rich pricing,\" analyst James Schutz at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp said, noting that the deal -- which would make First Bank the 14th largest bank in the United States based on assets -- values U.S. Bancorp at about $59.08 a share, or 19.2 times 1996 earnings.  \nU.S. Bancorp shares were up 6-3/16 at 54-7/16 Thursday.\nBut at the same time, First Bank chief executive John Grundhofer's reputation for aggressive cost cutting, the complementary fit of U.S. Bancorp with Minneapolis-based First Bank's mostly Midwestern markets, and the rich price of bank stocks in general, make the deal palatable to analysts.\n\"It's a natural fit for them,\" said Frank Barkocy, analyst at Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross. \"It's a natural extension of their marketplace.\"  \nFirst Bank said it would be able to grow revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp's extensive corporate base. Home equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp's customers, while U.S. Bancorp's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers, the banks said.\n\"Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines,\" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group.  \nFirst Bank expects to cut the combined banks' operating expenses by about 14 percent, with a pre-tax cost savings of about $340 million.\n\"We believe that (First Bank's) ability to cut costs could make this deal work,\" Salomon Brothers said in a note on the deal, according to market sources.\nWhile First Bank stock was down 3-1/2 at 74-3/4 Thursday, analysts still saw the deal as a positive for the acquisition minded bank.\n\"They've got the acqusition history behind them,\" Biggar said. \"They've got a management that can make deals work.\"  \nThe deal could also spark more bank consolidation, especially in the Midwest, with buyers swooping in while First Bank is busy consolidating its purchase, analysts said.\n\"We expect this announcement could trigger other activity,\" Salomon Brothers said, according to market sources.\nAmong potential targets frequently mentioned are Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp and Cleveland-based KeyCorp. Schutz even argues that Chicago-based First Chicago NBD Corp could be an attractive target at a reasonable price.\n\"For bang for the buck, First Chicago is probably the most lucrative\" in terms of Midwest markets, he said.\n((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787))\n", "Far East metal traders said on Tuesday they were resigned to seeing China steer clear of major copper purchases before the end of April, when the country's high consumption season begins.\n\"Now is not the right time of year, I think more towards the later part of this month because that's when the season starts,\" said the head of a trading house in Hong Kong with smelting and refining interests in China.\nSmall parcel purchases of 500 to 2,000 tonnes at a time by end-users continued, he and other traders said, as they had run down inventory and had no choice but to pay current high prices.\nThe price of copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) has been hovering around $2,300 a tonne for the past couple of months, as the market waits for China's annual buying programme to begin.\nLME copper finished the afternoon kerb last Thursday, ahead of the Easter holiday, at $2,372 a tonne.\nChina's peak season coincides with the end of winter, as construction projects gear up.\n\"China is producing healthy amounts of cathode from its own sufficient supplies of concentrate,\" a trader in Beijing said. \"For a short period of time, domestic production should be able to support demand.\"\nShanghai Metal Exchange figures show 14,828 tonnes of copper held on warrant in exchange warehouses, which local trading sources have said would be sufficient supply for two months.\nAttention has focused on zinc, as Japan's window of tariff-free import opportunity from designated developing countries under its General System of Preferences (GSP) closed on March 31.\nBrokerage house Brandeis said last week GSP imports of zinc were expected to reach 90,000-100,000 tonnes, compared to 84,000 tonnes last year. About 70,000 tonnes of that zinc would come from China, Brandeis said, up from 49,000 tonnes last year on expectations of higher world zinc prices spurring higher exports.\nZinc prices on the LME have hovered around 4-1/2-year highs of $1,300 a tonne for the past few weeks, with many trading sources in the region confident of seeing prices touch $1,400 in the foreseeable future.\nZinc closed on the LME on Thursday at $1,295 a tonne.\nA trader in Beijing said he expected LME zinc to correct downwards in the short term before bouncing back above $1,300 a tonne.\n\"After that I think there will be a consolidation and we could see the price move above $1,400 even in the first half of the year,\" he said.\nHe and other sources in the region said China has begun to move substantial quantities of zinc to LME warehouses in Singapore, with estimates of 20,000-25,000 tonnes on the way.\nChina's major smelter, Huludao in the northeastern province of Liaoning, was producing 10,000 tonnes of special high grade zinc ingots a month despite annual capacity of 330,000 tonnes, a Chinese industry source said.\nTechnical problems were keeping production of high quality exportable ingots down, he said.\n\"The goal is to do as much special high grade as possible but there are problems with the wet electrolytic process that mean they cannot clean the liquid properly and the impurities are higher than they should be for special high grade,\" he said.\nSources at China's other major smelter, Zhuzhou in Hunan province, and at one of its trading representatives in Hong Kong have said it plans to gear up production to take advantage of the high world prices.\nChinese producers are also known to move zinc to Singapore to use as collateral for bank loans. In this case it does not necessarily appear on LME warrants, traders said.\n", "Philip Morris Cos. Inc. Chief Executive Geoffrey Bible said Thursday that the world's largest cigarette maker was open to \"reasonable measures\" aimed at resolving anti-tobacco lawsuits in the United States.\nBible declined to comment on negotiations between cigarette companies and anti-smoking forces on a possible resolution of hundreds of lawsuits and stricter regulations facing the beleaguered but highly profitable industry.\nBut he told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that \"we will listen and explore all reasonable measures.\"\nHe also said Philip Morris was willing to work with government officials to hammer out new regulations on tobacco sales, even as the industry fights a court battle against tough new restrictions on sales, especially to minors, put in place by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year.\n\"We are willing to work with responsible government representatives and others on a balanced system,\" Bible said.\nHe did not spell out what initiatives he might consider, other than to say Philip Morris favoured restrictions on young people buying cigarettes and two years ago launched a programme to limit people under 21 from obtaining cigarettes.\n\"We do not want kids to smoke,\" Bible said.\nAnti-smoking groups have said the industry targets its advertising to encourage young people to smoke.\nAt the meeting, Philip Morris shareholders rejected a shareholder proposal that the company adopt the same standards on marketing to youths outside the United States that it put in place domestically two years ago.\nBible also said Philip Morris would continue fighting the of hundreds of individual, state and class-action suits it faces \"vigorously.\"\nTobacco executives have met for the first time in recent weeks with state officials and anti-smoking activists on possibly settling the massive litigation against the industry.\nNegotiators said on Wednesday they had met on Sunday and Monday in Chicago but reported that no deal was imminent, a White House official said after negotiators from both sides briefed White House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey.\nPublished reports have said the industry might pay as much as $300 billion over 25 years into a compensation fund for smokers who fall sick with lung cancer and other diseases. In return, cigarette makers would get broad shelter from lawsuits and would likely see higher stock market valuations on their tobacco and non-smoking businesses.\nOutside the Philip Morris meeting, about 20 protesters wearing giant Marlboro cigarette costumes greeted shareholders arriving for the meeting at the company's biggest plant.\n\"Shame on Philip Morris,\" read signs carried by the protestors from INFACT, a Boston-based anti-smoking group that says Philip Morris uses its lobbying to harm public health.\nMarlboro, Philip Morris' best-known brand, helps the company capture about 50 percent of all domestic cigarette sales.\nOther protestors wore big \"Uncle Sam\" hats and took play money from the people dressed as Philip Morris cigarettes.\nA spokeswoman for Philip Morris said the INFACT protestors were welcome to voice their opinions.\nPhilip Morris stock rose 87.5 cents to $41.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "Vencor Inc. has a definitive agreement to acquire Theratx Inc., another health care service provider, for $354 million, or $17.10 per share, in cash, the companies said Monday.\nVencor said it expected to begin a tender offer for all of Theratx's roughly 20.7 million shares on Feb. 14.\nTheratx's stock shot up $3.50 to $16.625 on Nasdaq. Vencor was unchanged at $32.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"This will make Vencor the only company out there that can offer the long-term care hospital, the nursing home and the contract services,\" said D.A.

Rothwell said the improvement would be driven by breast and lung cancer drug Taxotere, which he predicted would achieve peak sales of at least $500 million over the next five years.\nSales this year are forecast to double in 1997 from around $90 million last year. Brain cancer treatment Gliadel, which Rothwell said should be approved in the U.S. in 1998, will also fuel the improvement.\n\"We continue to be interested in a partnership or alliance in the U.S. Others have two or three cancer products in a market dominated by Bristol-Myers Squibb, so it would make sense to ally ourselves,\" he said.\nRothwell cited RPR's link with Novo Nordisk on hormone replacement therapy as a model for other therapeutic alliances.\nHe again brushed aside recent speculation that RPR, which is 68 percent-owned by France's Rhone-Poulenc SA, could be a suitor for Sanofi, saying that the French company would not help achieve his aim of building up RPR's strength in the U.S. and Japan.\n\"The U.S. is still the largest and most profitable market in the world,\" Rothwell said, noting that only 24 percent of RPR's sales are in the United States compared to more than 40 percent for many of its rivals.\nHe said he wanted to raise U.S. sales to around 35 percent of the group's total, adding: \"That will only come about through internal growth and perhaps from opportunistic product deals.\" In Japan RPR's strategy would be to continue with alliances and to build on the \"eight or nine products in Phase II and Phase III trials\".\n\"If the right kind of acquisition came along we would consider it, but the very good Japanese companies are the ones that can't be bought,\" he added.\nIn addition to cancer, RPR's growth strategy will centre on enhancing its position in key therapeutic areas, including thrombosis, asthma/allergy and anti-infectives.\nIt will also seek to swap non-core products with other companies and build up its base of early-stage products through links with universities and biotech companies.\nIn thrombosis, where RPR is number three in the world, the company expects sales of its best-selling drug Lovenox to double by the end of the century to more than $800 million.\nIn asthma and allergy, where RPR's position was enhanced by the acquisition of Britain's Fisons  FISN.L, Rothwell said RPR was likely to remain in fourth place in five years' time, but predicted it would have overtaken Germany's Boehringer and would be challenging Sweden's Astra for third place.\nRothwell also hopes RPR will move up from 15th to be in the top five for anti-infective sales by the year 2005. He said new oral antibiotic Zagam and \"other compounds under consideration\" should boost its standing.\nRPR is currently the 11th largest drug company in the world in terms of total sales.

The businesses are doing well. It does seem to be getting gradually better this year in mainland Europe,\" George said in an interview. Trading profits from its European hotels fell slightly in 1996.\n\"In Germany we have seen a few patchy signs of improvement.

That was partially offset by declines in financial services and consumer long-distance revenues, the company said.\nAT&amp;T said long-distance calling volume in the most recent quarter increased by 6.7 percent over the same period of 1996, but revenue from those services rose only 0.6 percent to $11.51 billion.\nVolume from consumer long-distance was flat and revenue fell 1 percent to $6.06 billion, the company said.

What we are doing is seeking an explanation from the banks,\" Fels said in a radio interview broadcast on Monday.\nNational Australia Bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp all cut their standard variable mortgage rates by 0.35 percent to 7.2 percent on Friday, hours after the Reserve Bank cut official rates by 0.5 percent to 5.5 percent.\nGovernment and opposition politicians and consumer groups have since suggested the banks colluded to ensure they did not pass all of the official rate cut on to their customers.\nFels said the commission would ask for details of any communications between the banks on Friday and whether there had been any previous discussion about their approach to possible official rate cuts.\n\"The reason why we're seeking an explanation from the banks is that it is unusual for them all to have moved so quickly within a few hours of one and other and to have reduced their rates by the same limited amount of 0.35 (points) as against a Reserve Bank reduction of 0.5,\" Fels said.\n\"Occasionally, one player will do something a bit different,\" Fels said.\n\"But in this case the four big players, all of them, moved by exactly the same amount, despite having told so many of us over time that their circumstances, their costs and their strategies all differ.\"\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, the first big bank to cut mortgage rates after Friday's official rate cut, denied on Monday that it had colluded with the other major banks.\n\"I haven't discussed interest rates with the other banks,\" CBA Managing Director David Murray said.\n\"We have a very careful discipline within the bank, because we don't believe in collusion, we believe in competition,\" Murray said, adding he would cooperate fully with the ACCC.\nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard on Friday questioned the level of competition amoung the banks.\n\"It is pretty hard to believe we have a highly competitive banking system at the present time when there can be delays of the kind that we are apparently about to witness in the passing on in the reduction in official interest rates,\" Howard said.\nOpposition politicians also criticised the banks, who have also come under heavy public fire this year for increasing bank fees to offset a squeeze on home lending margins.\nOpposition Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said it was hard to believe the banks were not colluding on rates. \"It's a little like a line of chorus girls, all with impeccable timing raising their leg exactly so high,\" Evans told reporters.\n", "A four-year saga over Hong Kong's Container Terminal Number Nine (CT9) project was finally resolved on Thursday with a berth swapping plan and removal a key consortium, government officials said at a news conference.\nUnder the terms of the deal, which received Beijing's blessing on Thursday, British-controlled Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd no longer leads the consortium, which has been renamed Asia Container Terminals Ltd (ACT).\nACT, formerly the Tsingyi Consortium, would swap the two berths in CT9 originally awarded for two existing berths in the existing Container Terminal Eight (CT8) currently operated by Modern Terminals Ltd (MTL), a unit of Wharf (Holdings) Ltd\nThe Sea-Land Group would take over from Jardine as leader of the consortium, said an ACT spokesman also present at the news conference.\nMTL would build three of the four berths at CT9, while Hong Kong International Terminals Ltd (HIT), a a unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, would build one berth.\nBoth HIT and MTL would also have one smaller feeder berth each at CT9, officials said.\nThe contract to develop CT9, which will have an annual capacity of 2.2 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) upon completion, was awarded by the Hong Kong government in 1992 to the consortium by private treaty grant.\nTsingyi was originally allocated two berths.

They can sell them only to the central bank, which at the moment is not buying, bankers said.\nThey said the lack of liquidity would make it difficult for the market to absorb the state bank funds gradually being withdrawn from the secondary markets.\n\"By promising more activity in the open market operations, the central bank wants to offset part of the impact of the ban,\" said a state debt analyst with a Chinese brokerage. \"But the central bank will have some difficulty keeping its promise.\"\nThe central bank kicked off open market operations on a trial basis in April last year, trading short-term T-bills of one year and less with 14 state banks to give an indication of the bank's policies and to help to control money supply.\nBut accumulated turnover so far has only marginally topped four billion yuan ($482 million), too small to give any clear clues to the state of China's money markets, analysts said.\n\"We expect turnover of the open market operations to be significantly increased this year,\" a central banker said on Friday but declined to give any details.\nLast week, deputy governor Chen Yaoxian was quoted by the official media as saying Beijing intended to make the open market operations one of the major means of controlling China's money supply this year. He did not give any details either.\n\"The central bank is surely feeling the urgent need to expand the open operations now that it has banned state banks from trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets,\" said one banker with the Bank of China.\n\"All major state banks have stopped trading on the markets,\" she added. \"But we have a lot of state debt in hand and the central bank must know we need to quickly find an outlet to prevent losses. We can't leave large sums just sitting there.\"\nThe central bank at a meeting last week told state banks to withdraw from the markets, offsetting existing positions gradually. The aim is to stop bank funds from leaking into the volatile stock markets, traders said.\n\"One key problem is that the central bank has not bought any state debt on the primary market,\" said the state debt analyst with a Chinese brokerage. \"It has little state debt on hand to trade significant amounts of T-bills with the state banks.\"\n\"Trading in the open market operations so far has been unilateral with the central bank only buying state debt,\" said a banker with a major state bank. \"Real open operations require the central bank to have a supply of state debt first.\"\nAnother difficulty is how to ensure the state banks make as much from the operations as they have off the state debt secondary markets, analysts said.\n\"We have made good returns on the state debt secondary markets,\" said the banker from the Bank of China. \"We cannot expect the same returns in the open market operations, which will hurt our enthusiasm in trading with the central bank.\"\nCurrently, the open market operations involve the central bank buying a total of 40 to 50 million yuan in state debt once a week from the 14 designated banks, bankers said.\nThat is a minuscule amount compared to the billions of yuan worth of state debt the state banks are used to trading each week on the state debt secondary markets in a week, they said.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n", "Martinair has begun its \"historic\" freighter service between Guangzhou and Amsterdam, the Dutch airline's Far East general manager, Walter Tseng said.\nTseng told Reuters in an interview, that he expects the new service will be slowly built up after initial flights on December 20 and 29.\n\"The first two flights were a combination of local cargo supported by cargo from Hong Kong and topped up in Bangkok so it was shared by three hubs which we are using to slowly build up the Guangzhou service.\"\n\"You have to remember Guangzhou is nothing compared to Hong Kong which is the traditional entry point.

The move would \"avoid disputes and criticisms\", union boss Cheng Yiu-tong said.\nPro-democracy trade union federation leader Lee Cheuk-yan attacked the bid to widen the net.\n\"(It) is a step backward, because they want to have more organisations defined as political groups,\" Lee told Reuters. \"They want to pressure these organisations to depoliticise.\"\nHuman Rights Watch/Asia said in a report on Tuesday that China's striking of the term \"counterrevolution\" -- the communist code for subversion -- from the law books in March did not mean easing political controls. Quite the opposite.\n\"China has merely replaced the term 'counterrevolution' with the equally elastic notion of 'endangering state security' and has, in the process, actually broadened the capacity of the state to suppress dissent,\" the report said.\nHong Kong people, who China has vowed can keep their legal system and way of life for 50 years, could suffer, it said.\n\"Despite Hong Kong's separate legal system, Beijing may have the power to bring Hong Kong people to face trial in mainland courts,\" it said.\n", "An army of financial market regulators were preparing Sunday to descend on NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank, which said Friday it found a 50 million pound ($81.4 million) hole in its options trading books.\nThe Securities and Futures Authority, which licenses options traders, and the Bank of England, which regulates banks generally, both said they would be working closely together to establish what had gone wrong at NatWest Markets.\n\"Supervisors work closely together and there is no doubt that we will talking about what has happened at NatWest,\" a Bank of England spokesman said.\nThe spokesman could not confirm, however, the existence of a formal joint investigation with the Securities and Futures Authority, as reported in some British newspapers Sunday.\nThe Serious Fraud Office, which investigates large fraud cases in Britain said it was not yet involved in the case.\n\"We are not investigating the case, it has not been referred to us and it's not appropriate to speculate about whether it will be,\" a Fraud Office spokesman said Sunday.\nIt also remained unclear Sunday whether the operations of an interest rate options trader, named by banking sources as Kyriacos Papouis, who now works for U.S. securities house Bear Stearns, included any element of fraudulent behaviour.\n\"At the moment, this looks like a trader trying to trade his way out of a loss,\" a banking source said. \"But it's not clear how or why, or how it took so long to discover.\"\nA spokeswoman for NatWest Markets said the deals had taken place over a period of time in 1996 and had come to light only in the past few days.\nShe confirmed the suspension of a senior options trader at NatWest Markets, named by sources as Neil Dodgson. A spokesman for Dodgson said he could not comment on the case but would be cooperating fully with any investigations.\nThe case is sure to raise again the question of supervision of derivatives trading, especially as all London firms went through an apparently exhaustive review of their risk management control systems following the collapse of the Barings investment bank in 1995.\nBarings collapsed under losses of 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) after rogue trader Nick Leeson embarked on a spree of unauthorised derivatives trading.\nWhile the current case does not compare in terms of scale and does seem to have been nipped in the bud, it will still cause major waves around London's financial circles.\n\"We are making a very thorough review of our control systems -- both internal and external,\" the NatWest Markets spokeswoman said. \"This is a business that requires constant scrutiny, you can never be complacent about the control procedures.\"\nThe question in the NatWest case is whether the \"mis-pricing\" of options was done for personal gain or to hide the real position or was just hopelessly bad trading.\nNatWest is also likely to face criticism in the coming days over the suspicion that it already knew of the loss when it announced its 1996 results last week.\nNatWest has vigorously denied this, saying it brought the matter to light as soon as possible and has kept regulators fully informed.\nNatWest also said no client had been affected.\nSome sources said Natwest should perhaps have said no client had been \"adversely\" affected since the 50 million pounds ($81 million) must be shown as a gain in a trading book somewhere.\n", "The Czech December trade deficit should rise to 16 billion crowns ($575 million) from 14.3 billion in the last month of 1995, ending the worst Czech trading year on another sour note, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Friday.\nCzech 1996 trade figures are to be released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Monday.\nMost economists surveyed said they expected steady growth in the deficit but few surprises. \"I expect that the figures will be in line with the development throughout 1996,\" Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance, told Reuters.\nWhatever the December deficit, the full-year trade gap is guaranteed to be a record given that the January-November figure reached 140.1 billion crowns, already far beyond 1995's record total shortfall of 95.7 billion crowns.\nMost analysts agreed a 15-17 billion crown December gap, after a 16.6 billion crown shortfall in November, would match prevailing trends and the consensus forecast of a 1996 deficit of 155-165 billion crowns.\nThe foreign exchange and money markets are expected to show little reaction to the figures -- the worsening Czech trade balance has been long built into crown rates -- as long as the results do not vary greatly from the estimates.\nAnalysts say the trade balance has been hurt by a downturn in western European economies. Effects of a recovery in demand have yet to help Czech exports.\nCSU figures consistently show the rate of import growth exceeding export growth, although the gap has narrowed in recent months.\nCzech exporters told the CSU in a survey released earlier this month that, among other suggestions, they would want a 20 to 25 percent devalution of the crown against a mark/dollar basket to help boost lagging exports in 1997.\nThe exporters said that if there were no devaluation of the strong Czech currency, then they expected the government to adopt administrative measures such as higher tariffs and surcharges to regulate imports.\nThe government and central bank, however, have repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to boost exports.\nAnalysts point to mid-1997 as a crucial time in which the import wave -- which is aimed at modernising industries -- must show results in productivity growth and competitiveness.\n\"There are concerns of the effect this has on the current account deficit,\" said one London-based economist.\n\"There is a question of the sustainability of the current account deficit. If you have a significantly higher (trade) figure than 15 or 16 billion crowns for December, I think people will get a little bit edgy,\" he added.\nThe current account ran a deficit of $3.1 billion for the first three quarters of the year, in the latest available figures, spurred by the spiralling trade deficit which stood at the time at $4.1 billion.\nEconomists have said the current account deficit for 1996, forecast at roughly seven percent of gross domestic product, could be financed in the short to medium term through the capital account surplus and strong central bank reserves.\nHowever, the deficit might start putting pressure on reserves in the second half of 1997.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=27.84 Czech Crown)\n", "Engineering group Skoda a.s. said on Tuesday it had won an order to supply trolleybuses worth more than $170 million to the city of San Francisco, the largest order of Czech goods ever to the United States.\nSkoda spokesman Jaroslav Hudec said the electrically powered buses would be produced in the Czech Republic and assembled at Skoda's subsidiary, Electric Transit International (ETI) in Baltimore.\n\"We consider victory in this tender to be an extraordinary success not only in view of the expected volumes of supplies...but also because the U.S. market is among the most prestigious and demanding in the world,\" Hudec said.\nPlzen-based Skoda, no longer affiliated with the Czech car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s., has made an aggressive push into new markets, aiming to offer western-quality units with the comparative cost advantage of eastern European production.\nThe San Francisco contract would open the way for Skoda, an engineering conglomerate which makes goods ranging from nuclear power components to drink cans, to win more business in the United States, Hudec said.\n\"Considering the ecologisation of public transport in the U.S., Skoda Plzen has real chances to win further orders... and also bring the brand Skoda to the U.S. market in relation to other production of our factories,\" he said.\nETI's president, Ladislav Tetal, told Reuters the order would virtually replace San Francisco's entire fleet of 300 buses, as the city retains only a few dozen younger units.\nHe said the deal had no connection with San Francisco's landmark cablecar lines which will continue to be a symbol of the \"City by the Bay\".\nThe total for the order with details of the financial and technical conditions would be finalised by mid-year, Hudec said, but declined to give further details.\nThe deal must still be approved by the San Francisco board of supervisors in a vote scheduled for April 22, ETI said.\nSkoda has made over 12,000 trolleybuses since 1936 -- many of which can be seen running in cities throughout the former communist bloc.\nEarlier this decade Skoda won a contract to supply 54 trolley buses to the city of Dayton, Ohio, and founded a U.S. joint venture with private partners in Baltimore, ETI, to assemble the buses. Skoda holds a majority stake in ETI.\nThe Dayton supply is scheduled to be completed in 1998. Skoda said it is also pursuing joint ventures to build trolley buses in Russia and Iran.\nGuy Creasy, equities analyst at IB Austria Securities in Prague, said that while the San Francisco order was indeed a positive signal for Skoda shares, lingering questions over the cost of recent acquisitions remained.\n\"I don't think (the order) is a drop in the bucket, but I don't think it will make the difference between profit and loss,\" he said. \"I don't think it will make us change (Skoda's share recommendation) to a 'buy'.\"\nCreasy said that it was not yet clear how earnings from the order would be divided with Skoda's U.S. partners.\nAnalysts have been wary about Skoda shares, awaiting 1996 results which should show the impact of buying two ailing Czech truck makers, Liaz a.s. and Tatra a.s..\nSkoda shares gained 25 crowns in Tuesday's fixing on the Prague Stock Exchange to 871 crowns, reversing a downtrend in the stock which ended 52 crowns lower on Monday. The shares showed thin activity after the Tuesday fixing.\nSkoda said in a statement on Monday that it planned to raise its basic equity by 2.5 billion crowns through an unspecified share issue still to be decided by shareholders.\nThe Czech state National Property Fund (NPF) in March said it would sell its remaining 8.7 percent stake in Skoda soon through the Prague share markets.\nNews of the San Francisco order comes as the Czech Republic has posted record trade deficits. The country's current account deficit topped eight percent of gross domestic product last year, up from four percent in 1995.\n", "Dean Foods Inc, which staged a turnaround in the fiscal third quarter with earnings more than double a year ago, expects to make an acquisition in the fourth quarter, potentially in the fluid milk business.\n\"We are probably talking to more companies today than ever (before),\" William McManaman, chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview.\nPotential acquisition targets include fluid milk processors and or a small company that would complement Dean Foods' specialty segment, which makes coffee creamer, he said.  \nMcManaman said he expected Dean Foods to close at least one acquisition \"in the not too distant future,\" and likely in the current fiscal fourth quarter.\nAcquisitions in the past have been a growth engine for Franklin Park, Ill.-based Dean Foods. Earlier, it posted better than expected third quarter earnings of $0.51 a share, up from $0.17 a year ago. Earnings reflected improvements in all of its segments, including dairy, vegetables, pickles and specialty foods.\nPrudential Securities analyst John McMillin called the third quarter results a \"positive surprise.\"  \n\"It's a company that's getting its act together,\" McMillin said.\nLast year, Dean Foods undertook a strategic review of all its operations, which included closing or disposing of several plants, streamlining vegetable operations, and cutting costs.\n\"We've pulled back in a number of areas and ridded ourselves of a lot of poor performing pieces,\" McManaman said. \"Now we have to grow our cores a lot faster than in the past.\"\nFor example, Dean Foods' pickle operations earned $7.8 million in the quarter, up from $4.9 million a year ago, although sales declined to $82.6 million from $88.0 million.  \n\"We eliminated a couple of...products where we were not making a lot of money and customers where we were not making a lot of money,\" McManaman said, actions that cut pickle sales but boosted earnings.\nVegetable sales in the quarter dropped to $143.4 million from $146.5 million, reflecting lower inventories and higher prices that trimmed some sales. But the division posted a profit of $8.5 million, benefiting from lower costs, compared with a year-ago loss of $547,000.\nOn the dairy side, earnings were $27.0 million, up from $13.5 million last year, while sales gained to $443.1 million from $409.2 million.\n\"Our volume in the fluid milk business was up over four percent in the quarter, and we didn't make any acquisitions,\" McManaman said. \"That's increased volume or market share in the markets in which we compete.\"\nDean Foods shares were up 5/8 at 33-7/8 after trading as high as 34-3/8 earlier in the day.\n((Reuters Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))\n", "Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) on Tuesday gave investment grade ratings to three of the four largest Czech banks, but said the high marks were partly due to an implied safety net for the banks provided by the state.\nIn its first quality debt ratings for commercial banks in former communist Europe, S&amp;P gave long-term ratings of BBB-minus to Komercni Banka a.s. , Ceska Sporitelna a.s. , and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s..\nIt also issued all three banks short-term ratings of A3 for counterparty risk in trade with other banks.\nThe ratings fell short of the Czech Republic's sovereign rating of A, but were similar to the marks issued to the Slovak, Polish, and Greek central banks, and one grade above Hungarian sovereign debt.\nBut in explaining the ratings, S&amp;P said the three banks' size and position in the market made it \"highly likely that the Czech government would provide support\" if needed.\nThus, the ratings were higher than they would have been if based solely on each bank's financial situation.\nS&amp;P did not give a rating for the third largest Czech bank, IPB a.s. , which is waiting for a roughly one-third stake to be privatised in a tender later this spring.\nS&amp;P said Komercni had 25 percent of Czech deposits, 26 percent of the credit market and conducted 10 percent of total trading on the Prague Stock Exchange last year.\n\"Given the bank's size, its importance to the country's financial system, and position in the market, S&amp;P believes state support would be forthcoming if required in the future, although no formal guarantee exists,\" it said of Komercni, the country's largest commercial bank.\nIt said that Komercni's classified loans totalled 35.4 percent at the end of September and its outlook was stable.\nKomercni's deputy general director Borivoj Prazak told reporters after the announcement that the bank was \"very glad\" to receive the ratings. \"We held our ground,\" despite slower than expected Czech macroeconomic growth, he said.\nAs with the other two banks, the Czech government has a major stake in Komcerni, 48.7 percent.\nThe government has said it plans to privatise all state-held banks, so getting the ratings based on the tacit state safety net adds more intrigue to the debate over the speed and extent of Czech banking privatisation.\nS&amp;P noted that Sporitelna, the former Communist savings bank where virtually all deposits were kept, was still \"the most important player in Czech retail banking\" but said it \"remains vulnerable to further problems within the sector\".\n\"(Sporitelna's) asset quality problems remain a concern with customer loans classified as non-standard amounting to 43.6 billion crowns, representing 31.8 percent of gross customer loans at year-end 1995,\" S&amp;P said.\nIt said that CSOB's ratings reflected the bank's strong position in foreign trade financing and its joint ownership by the Czech and Slovak governments.\nThe S&amp;P report said CSOB's non-standard loan level had dropped to 41 percent of gross customer loans by the end of 1995 from 51 percent at the end of the previous year.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "Rising corruption, declining English standards and an erosion in the overall quality of life cloud Hong Kong's future under China, the British Chamber of Commerce in the territory said on Thursday.\nA survey of 196 British businesses operating in Hong Kong revealed key uncertainties for British business after the July 1 transition to Chinese sovereignty, despite an overall air of confidence in the future.\nHalf of those surveyed expected the rule of law to deteriorate, 72 percent forecast a decline in the quality of English and 85 percent were bracing for a rise in corruption.\n\"The overall message is one of British business confidence in Hong Kong, but that should be tempered by the realisation that business confidence is fragile,\" British chamber president Patrick Paul told reporters.\n\"Hong Kong has competitors within the region, such as Singapore and other locations, and I don't think Hong Kong can afford to be complacent,\" he said.\nThe survey revealed broad satisfaction with Hong Kong's communications network, its taxation and legal systems and its level of education.\nBut dissatisfaction surfaced in the costs of doing business, poor Sino-British relations and standards of English.\nLooking to the future, most British businesses were optimistic about increased access to China, and they anticipated improvement in Sino-British trade as soon as handover-related hurdles were overcome.\nBut business costs, availability of skilled labour, English standards, quality of life and maintenance of the rule of law were all highlighted as sources of concern.\nEchoing other surveys of ordinary Hong Kong people, a possible rise in corruption was by far the greatest source of worry associated with the return to Chinese sovereignty.\n\"The concern is whether or not that independent approach to dealing with corruption will be maintained,\" said chamber of commerce executive director Christopher Hammerbeck.\nPaul said concerns about corruption flowing across the Chinese border into Hong Kong were offset by a highly transparent system that would quickly reveal any tampering, as well as an alert international business community.\n\"The British business community and the international business community will be watching,\" he said. \"If corruption becomes so bad that Hong Kong becomes a bad place for business -- I don't believe it will happen, but if it does -- business will doubtless vote with its feet.\"\nEven with a small rise in corruption, Hong Kong would remain one of the least-corrupt areas in Asia, he said.\nHammerbeck admitted that, as well as pollution, possible post-1997 discrimination against the British played a role in expectations of a deterioration in quality of life.\n\"It is a concern but that's not to say it will happen,\" he said.\n", "Kmart Corp. said Monday it may merge its Builders Square stores with Waban Inc.'s HomeBase business in a deal that would create the nation's third largest home improvement chain.\nThe deal, which reflects consolidation in the highly competitive home improvement retail niche, would also complete Kmart's exit from speciality retailing.\n\"What this will do is complete (Kmart's) strategy of divesting non-core businesses,\" Michael Conn, Gruntal &amp; Co. retail analyst, said.\nKmart said if a deal was completed, the Los Angeles-based investment group Leonard Green &amp; Partners L.P. would hold a majority interest in the new company. Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., and Waban, headquartered in Natick, Mass., would each retain minority interests.\nThe proposed new company would have about 250 stores in 25 states with annual revenues of nearly $4 billion.\n\"We've been looking for the opportunity to combine Builders Square, a regional business, with another party...in a consolidating industry,\" Robert Burton, director of Kmart's investor relations, said.\nBuilders Square's stores are largely in the Midwest and central United States. HomeBase has 84 stores in 10 Western states.\n\"It makes perfect sense,\" First of Michigan analyst Daniel Poole said of the combination.\nBut he added that Home Depot, which operates retail stores for the do-it-yourself customer and home remodeler, still poses stiff competition for the new company that will be formed by combining Builders Square and HomeBase.\nMarvin Rich, Kmart's executive vice president of strategic planning, finance and administration, said the proposed transaction was part of his firm's plan for the disposition of Builders Square.\nHe said Kmart intends to reclassify Builders Square as a \"discontinued operation\" in its year-end financial statements and record a net loss of $350 million to $400 million from discontinued operations.\nBurton said the combination of Builders Square and HomeBase could be completed in Kmart's fiscal first quarter, which ends in April.\n\"While we are in the preliminary stages of this transaction, all parties are interested in the potential opportunity that could come from combining these similar home improvement operations,\" Rich said.\n\"Clearly, there is opportunity here to create a large, financially liquid home improvement business which can be competitive on a national basis,\" Rich said.\nWaban, which operates BJ's Wholesale Clubs as well as the HomeBase chain, said that as a result of its talks with Kmart it was suspending plans to spin off the BJ's unit.\n\"This (Kmart) transaction has the potential to provide Waban and its shareholders greater value than our previously announced plan to separate our BJ's Wholesale Club and HomeBase divisions through a tax-free spin-off of BJ's,\" Waban President Herbert J. Zarkin said in a statement.\nHe said that if a sale of HomeBase was concluded, the company would use the proceeds to retire corporate debt and for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock.\nKmart previously shed its speciality retail concepts, selling off to the public several companies including Borders Group Inc, The Sports Authority Inc. and OfficeMax Inc.\nIn 1994, Leonard Green &amp; Partners acquired PayLess Drug Stores Northwest Inc. from Kmart and merged it with Thrifty Corp. to form Thrifty Payless Inc. That chain was recently acquired by Rite Aid Corp.\nK-Mart stock closed up 12.5 cents at $11.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "Computer, give me $20.\nSuch a demand enters the realm of possibility with the introduction Monday of a device that turns a personal computer into an automated-teller machine capable of dispensing card-based electronic cash, marking a new step in PC-based home banking.\nFischer International Systems Corp. said its $60 device can be inserted into the floppy disk drive of any PC, enabling it to read \"smart cards,\" a new type of plastic credit-card that can perform electronic cash transactions and store bank account balances.\nAlready gaining popularity in Europe to pay for store purchases and streetside telephone calls, the \"smart card\" is beginning to take hold in the United States as a replacement for cash used in ordinary purchases like grocery shopping.\nBy enabling PCs to securely dispense money, the device may provide a major stimulus to home banking by empowering consumers to perform financial transactions that now require a visit to a bank branch or an automated teller machine.\n\"What's been missing is a low-cost, easy-to-use 'bridge' between smart cards and personal computers,\" Fischer President Michael Battaglia said.\nSmarty, as the product is known, is a slim piece of hardware that inserts into a personal computer's 3.5-inch floppy disk reader, allowing the machine to link via the Internet to banks or retail outlets.\nFischer holds key patents for smart card readers inserted into 3.5 inch floppy drives -- making Smarty the most readily adaptable card reader for the 200 million personal computers now in use, company officials said.\nThe device, which can be inserted into home or office personal computers or into a laptop computer when travelling, will enable consumers to make wider use of banking cards for purchases, replacing the need to carry loose bills and coins.\nThe product could be a boon to PC-based home banking, permitting full-scale transactions instead of the more limited functions now available, like electronic balancing of checkbooks, financial investment tracking or tax return filing.\nFischer officials said they were working with several major U.S. and European financial services firms to spur use of the devices in a variety of business and consumer applications, including home banking over the Internet.\nIn addition, Art Burton, Fischer's vice president of sales and marketing said the company was in talks with top providers of home banking software like Intuit Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to link Smarty to their software.\n\"We have had some discussions at various stages with the primary providers of home banking software,\" Burton said. \"We are also working with individual banks.\"\nBurton said the PC-based Smarty product will be offered later this year to consumers participating in a trial of smart card technology in New York City borough by a group led by MasterCard, Cititbank and Chase Manhattan Bank.\nIn addition, Fischer said it has received initial Smarty orders from the Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, for pilot testing by bank employees.\nOrders for demonstration models have also come from the U.S.-based credit card consortium Visa, U.K.-based Mondex International and Sweden's Telia Group.\nSmart cards contain an embedded microchip capable of storing more than 4 million bytes of computer data, or dozens of pages of information -- far more than existing magnetic-strip credit cards that hold just 40 characters or so.\nThe new financial data format can act as a one-stop shopping card storing electronic cash, a collection of credit cards, and other personal information including several forms of identification to prevent fraud.\nWhile slow to catch on in the United States, smart cards have grown popular in Europe and Asia.\nFischer, with annual revenues of about $20 million, is solely owned by Addison Fischer, its chairman and a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nAddison Fischer is considered one of the world's leading experts on computer security. He was one of the founders and principal owners of RSA Data Security Inc., developers of a popular computer security encryption technique.\nFischer faces many larger competitors in the smart card reader market, including France's Gemplus, U.S.-based Schlumberger Ltd. and VeriFone Inc., Germany' Siemens AG and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands. But these rival machines take the form of bulky computer attachments or standalone-terminals priced between $80 and $300.\n", "President Ernesto Samper, moving to reverse Colombia's status as an international drug pariah, urged Congress on Tuesday to quickly approve tougher anti-narcotics laws.\nSamper submitted legislation in mid-July to stiffen sentences for drug trafficking and to permit the confiscation of drug barons' property, but the measures are still tied up in Congress.\n\"I ask Congress to give urgent consideration to this (anti-drug) proposal,\" Samper said in a letter to lawmakers.\nHe said the judicial reforms \"reflect the government's unequivocal commitment to end drug trafficking and organised crime\" and would \"bring national laws into line with international parameters on drug trafficking and money laundering as laid down by the United Nations.\"\nBy speeding up the measures, government officials say Samper has his eye on restoring Washington's faith in Colombia's anti-narcotics efforts.\nWashington decertified Colombia as a partner in the global struggle against drugs in March, branding it a virtual outcast state. The government hopes to regain U.S. certification in March 1997, a government source said.\nPolitical analysts have noted that no country decertified by Washington has ever had the measure lifted, however, and Samper's alleged ties to drug lords weigh strongly against any move by the Clinton administration to let Colombia off the hook.\nFabio Ochoa, the youngest of a drug trafficking family linked to the once-powerful Medellin cartel, was released from prison on Monday after less than six years behind bars.\nU.S. drug experts have criticised the light sentences imposed on Colombian drug barons and say they continue to run their illicit activities from jail.\nSamper initially said the tougher sentencing could mean convicted drug traffickers spending up to 60 years in prison. But in the bill presented to Congress, the maximum sentence envisaged adds up to little more than one-third of that term.\nDespite Samper's push to regain U.S. certification, he has not yet submitted any bill that would reestablish extradition for drug traffickers. An extradition treaty with the United States was suspended with a constitutional reform in 1991, introduced against the background of a campaign of terror waged by major drug barons in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n", "Nike Inc., the world's largest maker of athletic footwear, reported a 24 percent jump in first-quarter profits Monday, reflecting strong demand for its shoes and apparel around the world.\nThe Beaverton, Ore.-based company also announced a two-for-one stock split, its second in two years.\nFor the three months ended Aug. 31, Nike earned $226.1 million, or $1.53 a share, up from $182.1 million or $1.25 a share a year ago. Revenues jumped 34 percent to $2.28 billion from $1.70 billion last year.\nThe earnings were slightly better than the $1.51 a share industry analysts had expected on average.\nBut the company's stock jumped sharply on news that Nike had taken orders for $3.5 billion in footwear and apparel through January, a 66 percent increase over the year-earlier period, analysts said.\n\"The futures were up beyond anybody's expectations,\" said Shelly Hale Young of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, who said few expected Nike to top the 55 percent increase in advance orders reported three months ago.\nAs a result, she and other analysts raised their Nike earnings estimates for the rest of the year, and Nike stock rose $2.375 to a record close of $121.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"Management is very pleased with these results,\" Nike Chairman Phil Knight said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.\nIn a statement, he said Nike's \"brand strength, which many thought was nearing its peak last year, continues to grow unabated in fiscal 1997.\"\nIndeed U.S. sales of Nike footwear surged 27 percent to over $1 billion in the quarter, while the overall market is growing at only about an 8 percent rate.\nYoung of Hambrecht &amp; Quist said she expected Nike to raise its share of the U.S. footwear market to 43 percent by the end of the fiscal year from 37 percent, with most of the increase coming at the expense of rival Reebok International Ltd.\nThe increase is coming even as Nike imposes a 7 percent rise in the price of its shoes, which can top $100 a pair.\nYoung said Nike's aggressive marketing and focus on footwear technology have given it the edge.\n\"They have the better shoes and they have the brand that consumers want to buy, and therefore they can increase prices,\" she said.\nOverseas, where Nike is not as well established in all markets, Nike sales rose 35 percent from last year's first quarter to $781 million, a figure that was hurt by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar.\nThe company also continued its strong performance in ahtletic apparel, where sales surged to $584 million, a 75 percent increase.\nAt the company's annual shareholders meeting in Beaverton, Ore., Knight and others strongly defended the company against rising criticism of its overseas manufacturing practices.\nShareholders overwhelmingly defeated a proposal for independent monitoring of the factories introduced by the United Methodist Church.\nKnight blamed media reports for distorting Nike's record and said the company generally pays twice the minimum wage in countries where it operates.\nHe said the company recently had discovered \"horrible conditions\" among Pakistani workers -- including children -- sewing soccer balls at home under contract for Nike and had worked to establish centralized sewing centers that would eliminate the abuses.\nNike outside directors Jill Conway and John Thompson said they had traveled recently to Indonesia and Vietnam and were generally satisfied by factory conditions.\n", "Global miner RTZ-CRA on Wednesday announced a major relignment of its sprawling minerals empire and removed any doubt that London was its capital.\nThe group, born of a 1995 merger of RTZ Plc and CRA Ltd, said it would now manage its world-wide businesses along six main product lines -- aluminium, copper, energy, industrial minerals, iron ore, and gold and other minerals.\nIt also said it would downsize its Melbourne office, CRA Ltd's headquarters, halving the number of jobs there and reducing its role to a support function.  \nCRA chairman John Uhrig said in outlining the changes that the merger, which maintained the two firm' separate listings, had so far not produced a better outcome for shareholders.\n\"It would have been surprising if it had in its first year of operation,\" Uhrig told a news conference in Melbourne.\nThe restructure leaves Australian-based executives to manage the aluminium, energy and iron ore businesses from Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. London handles the rest and remains the sole group headquarters, RTZ-CRA said.  \nThe Salt Lake City office of its Kennecott copper operation in the United States as well as the group's Johannesburg office would be closed, it added.\nThe new structure shifts the focus of management away from a geographical view of the world, where operations differ by country, toward a single management for each global business.\nIt eliminates problems of overlapping time zones and managements, ensuring the group does not become an unwieldy bureaucracy unable to compete with rivals dealing in just one commodity, the group said.  \nChief executive Leon Davis gave examples where, under the current structure, copper operations and coal mines were under several different leaderships across the globe.\n\"These are barriers that are artificially created and we are intent on removing them,\" Davis told the news conference.\n\"It will eliminate duplication, lower our costs and improve our efficiency,\" he added.\nMining analysts welcomed the move, with one seeing it as confirmation the RTZ-CRA marriage, made without RTZ making a takeover bid, was effectively a cheap buy-out of CRA.  \n\"If anyone thought the DLC (dual-listed structure) was anything other than a buy-out on the cheap they should assess this little move because they are virtually wiping out Melbourne head office,\" a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters.\nThe analyst said he expected the group to go a step further and rationalise its assets and then transform the dual-listed structure into the one company.\nRTZ-CRA has already proposed to ditch its double-barrelled name and become known, subject to shareholder approval this year, as Rio Tinto. RTZ's shares would then trade in London as Rio Tinto Plc and CRA's stock in Australia as Rio Tinto Ltd.  \nA Melbourne-based analyst said the cementing of London as the group's headquarters came as no surprise. \"It doesn't make any sense to have two head offices,\" he said.\nThat would come as cold comfort for the 100 people whose jobs have been scrapped in Melbourne under the reorganisation.\nBut RTZ-CRA said it would carry out the job cuts as painlessly as possible. \"The group will provide both practical and financial assistance to help their transition,\" it said.\n-- Melbourne bureau 61-3 9286-1421\n", "The Prague Stock Exchange, boosted by strong blue chip gains, hit a year-high on Thursday, but analysts said any strong bullish sentiment was tempered by a lack of liquidity and low foreign investor interest.\nAt the heart of the bourse's rise has been a resurgence of the market's two most-capitalised issues -- SPT Telecom and CEZ -- which account for over one-third of the PX50 index.\nBoth hits 52-week highs at the daily price fixing on Thursday to push the index 1.1 percent higher to 586.5, but analysts cautioned that the market was still plagued by a lack of liquidity, which was distorting price movements.\n\"Volumes are very thin, when you come to the market looking for a bigger parcel of shares it doesn't take much interest to move the prices. But the truth is, not a lot of foreign money is flowing in,\" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company.\nSPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, jumped 85 crowns to 3,660, while CEZ, which account for 14 percent, rose 34 crowns to 1,193.\nDealers said they did not see any fundamental reasons for SPT shares to rise much further, but that CEZ could climb another two or three percent.\nThe PSE has recently showed signs of life after a fourth quarter 1996 slump took 25 percent off the index after a lack of commitment on the part of government officials to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency undermined the market.\nThe index has gained a modest 8.7 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and bourse officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors.\nThough it may not be a panacea to the market woes, most analysts agree that the oversight commission could be the most important step the PSE could take in 1997.\n\"Foreign investors have definitely been heartened by official movement on cleaning up the market,\" said one foreign broker.\n\"The market will probably edge up slightly with such low liquidity. Hopefully when 1996 earnings begin to come in the bourse will have a new impetus,\" he added. Company results are expected to begin flowing in at the beginning of March.\nFactors outside the bourse floor are also contributing to the market's rise.\nRadek Vavra of Citicorp Securities in Prague said that given the current strength of the currency, the crown, and several other technical factors, the market should continue firming.\nHe added that he was seeing strong foreign investor interest, giving the rally potential \"to continue over the next week before it levels off in two to three weeks\".\nThe crown has gained some three percent against its dollar/mark basket since the beginning of the year, and analysts have predicted it will hold its value or strengthen further in the coming weeks.\nAt midday on Thursday it was trading at 5.16 percent above its basket mid-point, upslightly from the central bank's daily fixing at +5.12 percent.\n", "The Australian state of Victoria announced on Monday the nation's biggest gas privatisation, unveiling plans to sell its gas monopoly, Gascor.\nVictoria Treasurer Alan Stockdale made the announcement at a gas reform conference, where one industry consultant estimated the sell-off would reap around A$4 billion for the government.\nGascor will be be split into three separate, competing distributors by July 1, ahead of their sale from mid-1998.  \nThe Victoria government has already sold over A$13 billion worth of electricity assets, making it the leader in efforts to set up a national free market for energy.\n\"Gascor is currently ill-equipped to compete in the fast approaching national gas market,\" Stockdale told the conference.\n\"It is the vision of this government to create an integrated energy market that will deliver low-cost energy to industry and householders, providing Australia with an important boost to its competitiveness...,\" he added.  \nGascor has 1.4 million customers throughout Melbourne, 50 towns in rural Victoria and some border towns in New South Wales state. Its balance sheet shows net assets of A$1.14 billion.\nInterest in the Gascor businesses, to be known by individual names, is likely to come from private power utilities already operating in Australia and from new foreign entrants.\n\"I think a lot of the companies currently involved in electricity will also be interested in gas,\" said Walter Dewe, a a consultant who once headed a national taskforce on gas reform.\n\"I think there will be new ones that missed out for electricity and also gas companies,\" he told Reuters.  \nOffshore interest in Australia's emerging national energy market has come chiefly from the Britain and the United States.\nA consortium led by Britain's National Power Plc spent A$2.35 billion last year to buy Victoria's Hazelwood coal-fired power station.\nEarlier, another consortium headed by British-based Powergen Plc bought another Victoria generator, Yallourn Energy, for A$2.43 billion.\nU.S. utility Edison International has a controlling stake in another coal-fired power plant through its Edison Mission Energy unit.  \nU.S.-based Northern States Power Co is also eyeing the Australian market, declaring it was \"hell-bent on acquisitions\" in Australia this year.\nUnder the terms of the Victoria privatisation, gas prices will be capped below the cost of inflation until the year 2001.\nUntil then, only major gas consumers will be able to shop around among gas companies for the best deal, with all other consumers able to do so in 2001, regardless of where they live.\nThe move comes as plans are being drawn up to link the two biggest states, Victoria and New South Wales, with new pipelines to create a seamless gas market in the country's southeast.  \n-- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421\n", "General Motors Corp., stung by years of steady losses in its U.S. market share -- including another 1.3 percentage points in 1996 -- Wednesday vowed to aggressively reverse the trend in 1997.\n\"In 1997, we plan on aggressively increasing our U.S. share,\" Chairman Jack Smith told reporters at the North American International Auto Show here.\nGM remains the world's largest automaker, but it has sunk far since its glory days in the 1960s when it commanded half of the U.S. market. As recently as the mid-1980s it held as much as 45 percent of the U.S. passenger car market.\nIn 1996, GM's U.S. light vehicle sales fell 2.7 percent to 4.74 million units, causing its market share to drop to 31.3 percent from 32.6 percent in 1995 and 33.1 percent in 1994.\nSmith said the company's U.S. market share was hurt in 1996 by costly labor strikes in March and October, as well as by factory down-time to retool for new models.\nThe strikes by the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers cost GM an estimated $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in profits in 1996 as the company lost production of about 300,000 vehicles, said GM North American Operations President G. Richard Wagoner.\nWagoner added, however, that the strikes were \"worth it\" because they resulted in productivity-related gains for the automaker.\nSmith added that there could be other work stoppages, as GM still needed to reach local labor agreements at many of its assembly and parts plants.\nAssuming GM's labor relations are peaceful, the company expects to utilize more than 90 percent of its North American factory capacity in 1997, which will significantly help the company's profitability.\nGM's factory utilization in 1996 fell below the 85 percent it had in 1995, but was still well above the dark days of 1991-92, when it sank to 60-65 percent and led to massive losses.\nWagoner said GM was getting back on track toward reaching its goal of a 5 percent return on sales in North America but would not reach that level until the end of the decade.\nSmith said GM was in a \"strong position\" to regain market share this year with 15 new models being introduced during the 1997 model year. GM will not sacrifice profitability to gain market share, but will stay competitive with other automakers in offering incentives, he said.\n\"What we're looking for is for our products to sell themselves,\" Smith said. \"If we're in a market where somebody else has heavy incentives, we're going to be competitive. We're going to be a player.\"\nGM, however, sees greater opportunities for growth in its international operations, where sales in 1997 are expected to expand to $38 billion from $35 billion in 1996.\nWorldwide, Smith said GM holds about 17 percent of the global car and truck market and is aiming to raise that share by expanding into growing areas of the world, including Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.\nGM will expand its investments in overseas operations faster than in the United States, but it does not plan to cut back on North American product investment.\nSmith also announced that the automaker was developing new technologies that could help improve the fuel efficiency of its cars by 50 percent. Those include:\n-- A new direct-injection diesel engine that is now being introduced in overseas markets. The four-cylinder diesel could raise fuel economy in GM's minivans to 38 miles per gallon from about 20 miles per gallon for current V-6 gasoline engines.\n-- An electric-powered transmission flywheel that gives a boost to a conventional drivetrain and increases fuel economy. It also acts as a starter and alternator for the vehicle.\n-- Lightweight aluminum body structures that save weight.\n-- Hybrid electric vehicle technology that combine internal combustion engines and electric motors to gain dramatic range and efficiency improvements over both electric and conventional cars.\n", "Chinese copper producers could soon start selling their red metal to take advantage of current high prices -- and before a long-awaited correction hits the international market, Chinese traders said on Friday.\nLondon Metal Exchange (LME) copper, currently hovering close to its highest price in almost a year, is ready for a correction and Chinese producers want to get what they can before the price fall begins, a Shanghai copper trader said.\n\"Chinese producers have begun to sell domestically at these prices because they don't believe they will last,\" he said.\nPrices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME), which often move in tandem with the LME, rose on Friday morning, in what one trading source in the city said was a reflection of local fundamentals.\n\"Once the local selling becomes a factor here, the price in Shanghai will correct,\" he said.\nShanghai copper futures opened mostly up on Friday. The most active June 1996 contract opened at 23,650 yuan ($2,851) per tonne, up 300 yuan from Thursday's close. It moved around that level early in the session.\nTraders on the SME said copper was likely to consolidate in a range of 23,000 to 24,000 yuan ($2,771-2,891) in the short term with buyers and sellers having mixed views over its direction.\nLME copper see-sawed in trade on Thursday, breaching the $2,400 resistance level at the afternoon kerb. It closed at $2,403 per tonne, up $28 on the day, after fund buying at the midday dips spurred the price up.\nShanghai traders said they expected the funds to begin selling, bringing the correction with them in the process.\nTraders and analysts here have said the LME copper price is not supported by fundamentals and that the market is waiting for Chinese buying to begin.\nChina's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes, up 5.71 percent on 1995, according to State Statistical Bureau figures. Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.\nChinese media reported in January that China's 1997 copper demand should rise five percent over last year to 1.05 million tonnes. Output is expected to be more than 900,000 tonnes.\nCopper imports are expected to remain high, media reports have said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent to 714,248 tonnes.\nWestern traders and those elsewhere in the region agreed China needed to buy copper, but those polled by Reuters were unanimous that China appeared to be holding off on its buying programme while prices remained high.\nBut Chinese buyers are not known for entering the market at the bottom of a correction, instead, they are likely to wait for prices to rise again before coming in, Shanghai traders said.\n\"I think $2,100 to $2,200 (per tonne on the LME) would be a good price because China will need to buy, they are short of copper every year,\" said an executive in Shanghai with a European metal producer.\nShe said the crackdown on scrap imports, part of China's campaign last year against the import of foreign garbage, would lead to a rise in Chinese need for cathode.\n\"Domestic prices are still moving up, I guess because stocks are getting low,\" she said. \"They will have to buy eventually.\"\nFigures released last Friday by the SME show exchange warehouse copper stocks at 23,407 tonnes.\nBut local traders have said this figure has barely changed in recent months and the big question is the tonnage off-warrant, that is, the amount of copper not registered on the exchange but still available to the market.\n-- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-8544\n", "Australian government-owned Telstra Corp reported a 38.4-percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half as the costs of shedding almost a third of its workforce started to ring up for the telephone carrier.\nTelstra, which is to be partially privatised by the end of the year, also said it was in talks with global telecom carriers about forming possible alliances.\n\"We are dancing with everyone, but we haven't taken anyone home from the dance yet,\" chief executive officer Frank Blount told reporters after the results announcement.\nThe Australian carrier reported a net profit after abnormals of A$742.0 million (US$585.4 million) in the six months to December 31, 1996, compared with A$1.20 billion a year ago.\nRedundancy costs were A$1.03 billion in the half-year period with staff levels down by 7,000 during the half to about 69,500. Under Telstra's plan announced last September about 22,000 jobs are to go by the end of fiscal 1998/99.\nRevenue grew by 4.6 percent to A$7.77 billion in the December half. Blount said first-half revenue was pressured by a slowing economy and increased competition.\nIt was unlikely revenue would grow any faster for the rest of the year to June 30, 1997, Blount said.\n\"I think the economy is picking up, but we are still seeing softness in revenue, but it is still growing about the same level as in the first half,\" Blount told reporters.\nTelstra is to face stiffer competition in 1997/98 due to the deregulation of the local telecommunications markets from July 1, 1997, although few foreign telecom groups so far have openly stated they would enter the Australia market.\nBritish Telecom Plc (BT) and U.S. telecom giant AT&amp;T Corp have, however, been tipped to enter the local market.\nBlount said Telstra had been in talks with BT and its partner MCI Communications Corp, AT&amp;T Corp and the Global One consortium about possible alliances.\n\"We have had talks with Global One...we have had talks with AT&amp;T...and we have continuing talks with BT/MCI,\" Blount said. Excluding the abnormal losses, Telstra reported a 16.1-percent rise in net profit to A$1.40 billion.\nThe result was well received by the Australian government, which said the partial Tesltra float is still on for the end of 1997. The government gets to pocket A$625 million in dividend payments from the carrier.\n\"I think the company is very well placed for privatisation,\" communications minister Richard Alston told reporters in Canberra. \"We're still hopeful that (the sale) will occur before the end of the calendar year,\" Alston said\nThe government last year moved to sell one-third of Telstra for a projected A$8.0 billion, but recent estimates put the sale price much higher.\nTelstra is spending about A$3.5 billion on the rollout of its cable network around Australia, which carries its pay television service Foxtel that it owns jointly with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.\nTelstra's share of losses from Foxtel in the half was A$49 million, finance director Paul Rizzo told reporters.\n\"I am not concerned about the losses of Foxtel, because they are not that far off track, they are very close to plan,\" Blount said. \"Of course we are having losses in pay TV, that is the business,\" he said.\nA$=US$0.7890\n", "Kmart Corp. said Monday it may merge its Builders Square stores with Waban Inc.'s HomeBase business in a deal that would create the nation's third largest home improvement chain.\nThe deal, which reflects consolidation in the highly competitive home improvement retail niche, would also complete Kmart's exit from specialty retailing.\n\"What this will do is complete (Kmart's) strategy of divesting non-core businesses,\" Michael Conn, Gruntal &amp; Co. retail analyst, said.\nKmart said if a deal was completed, the Los Angeles-based investment group Leonard Green &amp; Partners L.P. would hold a majority interest in the new company. Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., and Waban, headquartered in Natick, Mass., would each retain minority interests.\nThe proposed new company would have about 250 stores in 25 states with annual revenues of nearly $4 billion.\n\"We've been looking for the opportunity to combine Builders Square, a regional business, with another party...in a consolidating industry,\" Robert Burton, director of Kmart's investor relations, said.\nBuilders Square's stores are largely in the Midwest and central United States. HomeBase has 84 stores in 10 Western states.\n\"It makes perfect sense,\" First of Michigan analyst Daniel Poole said of the combination.\nBut he added that Home Depot, which operates retail stores for the do-it-yourself customer and home remodeler, still poses stiff competition for the new company that will be formed by combining Builders Square and HomeBase.\nMarvin Rich, Kmart's executive vice president of strategic planning, finance and administration, said the proposed transaction was part of his firm's plan for the disposition of Builders Square.\nHe said Kmart intends to reclassify Builders Square as a \"discontinued operation\" in its year-end financial statements and record a net loss of $350 million to $400 million from discontinued operations.\nBurton said the combination of Builders Square and HomeBase could be completed in Kmart's fiscal first quarter, which ends in April.\n\"While we are in the preliminary stages of this transaction, all parties are interested in the potential opportunity that could come from combining these similar home improvement operations,\" Rich said.\n\"Clearly, there is opportunity here to create a large, financially liquid home improvement business which can be competitive on a national basis,\" Rich said.\nWaban, which operates BJ's Wholesale Clubs as well as the HomeBase chain, said that as a result of its talks with Kmart it was suspending plans to spin off the BJ's unit.\n\"This (Kmart) transaction has the potential to provide Waban and its shareholders greater value than our previously announced plan to separate our BJ's Wholesale Club and HomeBase divisions through a tax-free spin-off of BJ's,\" Waban President Herbert J. Zarkin said in a statement.\nHe said that if a sale of HomeBase was concluded, the company would use the proceeds to retire corporate debt and for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock.\nKmart previously shed its specialty retail concepts, selling off to the public several companies including Borders Group Inc, The Sports Authority Inc. and OfficeMax Inc.\nIn 1994, Leonard Green &amp; Partners acquired PayLess Drug Stores Northwest Inc. from Kmart and merged it with Thrifty Corp. to form Thrifty Payless Inc.

The longer the key, the harder it is to crack an encoded message, and the 56-bit key makes it 65,000 times tougher to decode.\nThe Security and Freedom through Encryption Act, sponsored by Virginia Republican Representative Robert Goodlatte, would allow U.S. companies to export strong encryption programmes if such products were being offered by foreign competitors.\nThe Clinton administration opposes the legislation, which it argues would allow international criminals and terrorists to get easy access to encryption that could thwart law enforcement agencies' efforts.\nUnder the adminstration's current policy, strong encryption can be exported only if it allows the government to crack the codes by recovering the software keys.\nNetscape has promised to abide by that policy, said its chief scientist, Taher Elgamal. Within two years, its products will allow the government to decode encrypted data by gaining access to the keys.\nIf the bill is approved by the Courts and Intellectual Property subcommittee, the full Judiciary Committee will consider it, said David Lehman, legislative counsel for Goodlatte.\nThe legislation will sail through the subcommittee and be voted on by the full committee in a few weeks, according to Shabbir Safdar, executive director of the Voters Telecommunications Watch, one of the groups endorsing the measure Monday.\n\"It looks very promising with 78 co-sponsors,\" Safdar said. \"This is the best hope in the House for real encryption reform this decade.\"\nOthers who endorsed the bill included the Centre for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Americans for Tax Reform.\nA similiar bill is pending in the Senate, where the Commerce Committee is expected to vote on its version in the next few weeks.\nNot all civil libertarians favour the legislation as currently drafted. Another group, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote Goodlatte this week asking him to delete a provision of the bill that would create new criminal penalties for using computer encryption \"in the furtherance of the commission of a criminal offence.\"\nThe group generally backed Goodlatte's efforts but said in its letter the new criminal penalties \"could have a series of unintended consequences that would easily undermine the other desirable features of the bill.\"\nFrom the Internet community, signers included the Internet Society and two private companies, Cybercash Inc. and Digex Inc.\nInstead of criminalizing use of encryption, the group said prosecutors should rely on existing federal and state laws prohibiting obstruction of justice and concealment of evidence.\n", "British super-utility Scottish Power surprised investors on Wednesday by promising a 19 percent jump in its final dividend after strong half year results and savings from its takeover of Southern Water.\nScotish Power's reported first half pretax profits rose 47 percent before 21.2 million pounds in exceptional charges for restructuring Southern Water.\nIts shares jumped to a high of 350 pence before edging back to 345 for a net gain of 3.5 pence after its earnings of 188 million pounds ($310.5 million), up from 127.7 million pounds a year ago, came in above forecast.\n\"Clearly the most impressive feature is the dividend forecast...it is promising more in the future than was expected,\" said Marshall Whiting, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.\nThe company, which serves one in five British households across its three strong regional bases, paid out an interim dividend of 6.17 pence a share compared with 5.17 pence previously and said the final dividend would be 18.5 pence.\n\"That was well above the trend,\" said Andy Stone, utilities analyst at brokers Daiwa.\nScottish Power said it expected to be able to boost pretax profits at Southern Water, the water and sewerage utility it bought for 1.68 billion pounds in August, by 52 million pounds a year. Total job losses are expected to be 2,050.\nIt said some 100 million pounds of cash should be released, with 70 million from disposals of businesses such as vehicle leasing and landfill sites and 30 million from property sales.\n\"We are very pleased with what we have found (at Southern Water)...we are now focusing back on the core business,\" chief executive Ian Robinson said in a telephone interview.\nScottish Power, which became the only British utility to span electricity generation and supply when it bought regional electricity company Manweb last year, also has interests in gas and telecommunications.\nLater bids for similar power utilities from generators National Power and PowerGen were blocked by the government on anti-competitive grounds.\nScottish Power said it aimed to provide customers with quality service at a competitive rate as electricity and gas markets head for liberalisation in 1998.\nRobinson said the purchase of Southern Water after a battle with rivals Southern Electric would benefit both shareholders and customers.\n\"We would expect to improve customer service...Scottish Power shareholders will strongly benefit as well,\" he said.\nScottish Power gained government approval for its takeover of Southern by promising cuts in prices to water customers by one percent next year and then by three percent for two years.\nRobinson said that between 200 and 300 jobs could be created over a couple of years as Scottish Power expands its retail business and positions itself to compete in the gas and electricity markets.\n\"It is our view that successful utility companies of the future will be those able to provide a high level of customer service while, at the same time, enhancing cost efficiency,\" the company said in a statement.

The chief operating officer post that Lutz also held was left vacant.\nLutz, a former Marine fighter pilot who is credited with pumping new life into Chrysler's product development process and making it the most efficient in the industry, is expected to stay on for two more years, a company spokesman said.\nChrysler's board also on Thursday took steps to boost shareholder value by increasing its share buyback programme to $2 billion from $1 billion for 1997, and hiking the annual dividend to $1.60 a share from $1.40.\nThe new quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share is payable Jan. 15 to stockholders of record as of Dec. 15.\nChrysler said it has now raised its dividend seven times in the past three years and has increased the payout by 433 percent since September 1993. Thursday's actions come about 10 months after the company settled a bitter fight with Las Vegas billionaire Kirk Kerkorian.\nKerkorian and his Tracinda Corp., the automaker's largest single shareholder, had mounted a hostile takeover attempt of Chrysler last year, complaining the company was not doing enough to reward shareholders. A Tracinda representative could not be reached for comment Thursday.\nIn its personnel moves, Chrysler switched international and product development duties among two top executives considered to be in line to succeed Eaton some day, Thomas Gale and Francois Castaing.\nGale will trade his duties as head of international operations for Castaing's duties as head of engineering and product development.\nGale, who becomes executive vice president - product development, will retain his control over product design, while Castaing, who becomes executive vice president - international, will retain his control of powertrain operations.\nFour other executive vice presidents did not receive job changes. But Chrysler spoksman Arthur Liebler said Gale and Castaing do not have an edge over them to be chosen as Chrysler's next chairman.\nLutz, who turns 65 in February, will report to Eaton and will focus primarily on the automaker's product development activities, and will serve as a \"coach, mentor and advisor,\" the company said in a statement.\n\"As vice chairman, Bob will focus his considerable talents on the product development process ... specifically on making sure we retain our product edge well into the 21st Century,\" Eaton said in a statement.\n\"He will continue as a member of the Office of the Chairman and as a director of the Company and will continue to be involved in all major decisions,\" Eaton said.\nIndustry analysts said the moves were aimed at allowing Chrysler to continue to take advantage of Lutz' skills while not eliminating any prospective future chairmen.\n\"They've really kept out of a sort of hysterical concern about where people fit in the organisation -- and that might not be too bad,\" said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Centre for the Study of Automotive Transporation.\nCole theorised Chrysler may never hand out the president title to a rising executive, thus allowing its executive vice presidents to concentrate on their current jobs.\n\"What they're really doing is managing the transition from the old Chrysler to the new one,\" he said.\n", "Leading British television companies BSkyB, Carlton Communications and Granada Group teamed up on Friday to apply to run digital terrestrial TV (DTT) services in Britain.\nThe formation of their British Digital Broadcasting venture, appeared to transform the prospects for DTT, previously dismissed as a \"lame duck\" technology.\nBritish Digital Broadcasting has put in an application to run three DTT licences, offering 15 channels, including subscription channels from the BBC.\nIt faces competition from U.S. owned cable company International CableTel Inc, which has also put in an application for three of the four available networks.\nThe company is Britain's third largest cable operator and owns NTL, one of two major British transmission companies.\nThe BSkyB/Carlton/Granada/BBC venture plans three premium subscription channels showing top films and sporting action. Another 12 channels will be offered as part of a basic subscription package.\nShares in the three companies surged on Friday as markets welcomed the news. BSkyB added 21.5p to 602p, Carlton gained 21p to 540.5p and Granada added 12.5p to 890p.\nDTT will broadcast from land-based transmitters to ordinary rooftop aerials. However, viewers will need a set-top decoder costing at least 200 pounds ($324) to receive the service.\nThere will be six digital networks or \"multiplexes\", each capable of broadcasting at least five channels. The first two have been earmarked for the existing, free, terrestrial broadcasters, the BBC and the ITV commercial network.\nThe other four will be awarded by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) watchdog body. The service is expected to be on the air by mid-1998.\nDigital television offers more channels, clearer pictures and the possibility of accessing interactive services such as home shopping and home banking.\nBut DTT, with only 30 channels, had been seen as the poor relation to BSkyB's planned satellite version which will offer 200 channels.\nBSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, is expected to press on with its digital satellite launch in Britain later this year. DTT is seen as a complementary service.\n\"By plugging in one simple set top box, viewers will be able to see all the existing terrestrial channels, new free channels, the latest movies and the best sport,\" said Carlton chairman Michael Green.\nGreen will chair British Digital Broadcasting, and Carlton, Granada and BSkyB will each own one third of the company which unites Britain's leading commercial ITV companies with satellite pay operator BSkyB.\nIf successful in winning the three licences, the shareholders have agreed to meet between them a peak funding requirement of up to 300 million pounds.

Bookings at Carnival Cruise Lines, the main unit of Carnival Corp, are up 37 percent in the three months through last Monday on a 13 percent rise in shipboard berths, Carnival Cruise Lines President Robert Dickinson said.  \nBut the customers are overwhelmingly from the U.S. and Canada and the offerings are unmistakably American -- whether aboard mass-marketer Carnival, which describes its increasingly gigantic vessels as fun ships, or the more genteel lines competing with upmarket amenities.\nThat's not all bad, the executives said, but more offerings tailored to national and regional tastes will likely be required in Asia and Europe.  \"The right ships have to go to the right places with the right food,\" said Celebrity Cruises Inc President Richard Sasso.  Celebrity is an Overseas Shipholding Group Inc affiliate.  \nBoth Carnival, the industry leader with almost 27 percent of all cruise berths, and number two Royal Caribbean are already active overseas and employ different strategies.\nRoyal Caribbean competes in Europe already but does little beyond hiring multilingual crews to change the on-board accomodations, food and entertainment from those it offers on seven-day trips from Miami, company chairman Richard Fain said.\n\"Our ships offer an American experience in Europe, not a European experience,\" Fain said.  \nThe European tours are aimed mostly at Americans, he said. \"We are carrying more Europeans in the Caribbean than in Europe,\" Fain said.\nCarnival, which expects to carry more than one million passengers in 1997, is taking a multi-pronged approach by acquiring the Italian cruise operator Costa and buying into UK tour group Airtours Plc.Carnival also has a joint venture with Hyundai Group to provide cruise holidays in Asia. \"Those three strategies were deployed to offer products in those markets for people in those markets,\" Dickinson said during the panel discussion.  \nIn addition, the company dispatches Carnival-branded ships on itineraries beyond its Caribbean stronghold to lure past Carnival passengers looking for different destinations.\nHarris of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co affiliate P&amp;O/Princess Lines said business arrangements must also be fitted to foreign markets.  He recalled his company, with its long history of ocean-going passenger transport, found it had to cut out its network of company-owned ticket offices and learn to rely on travel agents to sell its leisure-cruise berths.  \nSeveral executives said the early cruise successes in Asia of the Star line, a regional operator, might be an example to the big operators with their current lion's share of the global market who are eyeing that region.\nKirk Lanterman, chairman of Carnival affiliate Holland America Line-Westour, said the overseas cruise markets are very substantial already.  He said some three million people each year take cruises on small lines offering national or \"ethnic\" foods, entertainment and accomodations and about 500,000 non-Americans traveled on the lines operating from south Florida and elsewhere in North America.\nLanterman also warned his peers against diluting the character of their popular lines.\n\"It's very difficult to make these ships different for non-Americans without making it unsatisfactory for Americans,\" Lanterman said.\n((-- Miami newsroom, 305-374-5013))\n", "U.S. Midwestern local telephone company Ameritech Corp. said Friday it was in merger or acquisition talks with several European security monitoring firms worth $200 million to $500 million each.\n\"There are some serious negotiations going on,\" Ameritech's international affairs director Dennis LaComb told Reuters.\nChicago-based Ameritech hopes to double its current $4.0 billion in European investments over the next few years, said LaComb, who said he was in London until Saturday on a \"courtesy visit.\"\n\"The majority of our investment internationally is in Europe. This is a very important area for us,\" he said.\nOver the past six years, the Midwestern \"Baby Bell\" has taken stakes in privatisations abroad in countries such as Hungary and New Zealand.\nLaComb said that security monitoring -- using telephone lines to link customers' home alarm systems to police stations -- was a natural business direction for the $31.3 billion telecommuications company to take.\nAmeritech, which is facing its first taste of competition in its local market, is the second-biggest U.S. security monitoring company and hopes to become the European market leader.\nThe first deals are likely to be struck in Germany and France, although the company said it was also looking at firms in Scandinavia and was considering Britain.\nUnlike some of its sister Baby Bells, Ameritech has no current designs on becoming a global telecommunications player.\nInstead, it wants to focus its international strategy on regional telecommunications, communications such as alarm systems and exporting its knowledge of customer services and of operating in competitive markets to telecommunications firms, such as Portugal Telecom SA, which are on the verge of privatisation.\nAmeritech's foreign ventures so far include stakes in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand, a local, long distance and cellular phone and satellite television service provider, Poland's Polska Telefonia Komorkowa and Norway's NetCom GSM, two cellular telephone operators.\nIt has partnered with Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG to take a stake in Hungary's incumbent Matav Rt telecommunications operator and also holds a stake in Belgacom, the Belgium national operator.\nInternational investments also include a joint venture in China's regional cellular operator ChinaCom.\n", "Softwood lumber prices may stay at their current high levels or even start to climb once Canadian lumber companies are given a fresh quota to sell to the United States on April 1, some analysts say.\n\"My opinion is we'll be seeing higher prices,\" said Gilbert Garant, a commodity broker in Montreal for Whalen, Beliveau and Associates.\nSoftwood lumber was trading on Friday at about US$370 a thousand board feet (tbf), against about US$320 before the quota system began a year ago.\nApril 1 marks the start of the second year of the Canada-U.S. agreement to limit Canada's softwood lumber exports -- and brings with it new uncertainties.\nThe quota system limits fee-free exports from the four top exporting provinces to 14.7 billion board feet of lumber/year. Companies surpassing their quotas must pay a fee ranging from US$50 to US$100 per 1,000 board feet. Statistics from about mid-March showed the country as a whole had already exported about 98 percent of its quota, while many individual companies had surpassed their own quotas and were now paying penalties.\nIn the previous three quarters, the market has been jittery as firms that had already reached the ceiling on their quota withheld stock toward the end of the quarter, waiting until they received a replenished quota in the next quarter to avoid paying fees, Garant said in a phone interview.\nBut as the end of the fourth quarter approaches, \"I don't believe there's much being held back,\" said Garant.\nPrices have fallen slightly in recent weeks as some lumber producers rushed to fill their quotas for the year, since they will lose unused allocated quota that they had not turned back to the government by the end of 1996, analysts said.\nBut demand would likely rise to fulfill spring building needs, and Canadian mills did not have a glut of softwood lumber to satisfy rising demand, Garant said.\nBuyers \"probably think people have more on the ground than there really is,\" he said.\nInventories are low and demand is on the rise for now, agreed Patricia Mohr, vice-president of economics at Scotiabank in Toronto: \"I think actual demand will pick up.\"\nThe first year of the quota system has caused much uncertainty and price volatility in the market, a situation which will likely continue into the second year of the five- year agreement, analysts said.\n\"Things have settled down to a large extent, but it's far from clear what the next year will bring,\" said trader Gerry Yane at Marleau Lemire Securities in Montreal. \"There's not enough clear information coming out of the government.\"\nThe system has made statistics a hot commodity and pitted Eastern Canada against the West as politicians give quotas.\n\"It's been very difficult. This is a very large industry to put under quota,\" said Ronald MacDonald, parliamentary secretary to Canada's trade minister. \"I think the system has worked as well as we expected it to work.\"\nHe said there were bound to be bumps in the flow of lumber over the border at the end of every quarter as the quota system entered its second year, but the bumps would not be as dramatic as in the first year of the system.\n\"It won't be quite as bad, but you will get some problems like this,\" he said by phone from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.\nHe said there would be no major changes to the system in the coming year. He brushed off complaints from the West: \"The system is very fair to East and West.\"\nThe quota agreement gives Canada a bonus fee-free quota if softwood lumber averages more than US$405 in a quarter. Since the bonus was triggered in every quarter in the past year, the government has some leeway to give more quota this coming year to mills that were unfairly treated last year, MacDonald said.\n\"There might be some reallocation done mostly in favor of the East,\" added Garant. \"At this point, most major mills out of the eastern provinces are paying a minimum of US$50 (fee per one thousand board feet), and many are paying the US$100.\" (Corrects to U.S dollars from Canadian dollars).\nSome eastern mills have been out of quota room for almost two months, while in the West, some mills have had extra quota to fill at the end of the quarter, he said.\nThe interim allocation for companies in the first quarter starting April would be 28.75 percent of their full-year quota from last year, a government official said. The full-year allocations would be decided in the middle of May, he said.\n((Reuters Ottawa Bureau 613-235-6745))\n", "Electricity generator Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc turned in lower than expected half year profits on Thursday but hiked its dividend by 11 percent.\n\"We aim to keep on delivering dividend improvement...doing it by expanding the business,\" chief executive Roger Young told Reuters in an interview.\nPretax profits edged down to 61.3 million pounds ($101.6 million) from 61.7 million previously, below expectations of 63 to 70.7 million. The dividend was 5.28 pence per share.\nThe shares were down 1-1/2 pence at 316.5p at 1145 GMT.\nScottish Hydro said low rainfall had hit profits, as hydro-electric generation had been replaced in part by coal at a cost of 6.3 million pounds.\nBut chairman Lord Wilson said in a statement that the second half had started well and he was confident of \"an encouraging result for the full 12 month period.\"\nScottish Hydro said it was preferred bidder for the 50 percent stake in Keadby power station, northeast England, owned by United Utilities, its joint venture partner there, and aimed to complete the deal by the end of the current financial year.\nYoung said the plan would \"increase costs but also increase profits\", adding an extra 340 megaWatt of generation capacity to the company's existing portfolio.\nScottish Hydro said the deal should increase gearing to around 50 percent if it went ahead and added that together with existing expenditure commitments, gearing should peak at 65 percent in 1998-99.\n\"We are confident of the prospects for Keadby and look forward to the opportunity to exploit its capabilities in the market place,\" the company said in a statement.\nYoung said the company aimed to boost market share to seven percent from a current four percent by 1999 with a total investment in combined heat and power (CHP) plant for commercial customers of over 150 million pounds.\nThe company said that action taken to raise output and cut costs would improve performance over the next two to three years and added that raising standards was a key aim.\nScottish Hydro said that changes proposed to capital allowances in the British budget in November were expected to reverse a trend of falling tax rates but added it would not be possible to predict the impact accurately until full details were known.\nThe company will be looking to expand its domestic business, Young said, but a resumption of talks with British Gas on the sale of the latter's supply interests was unlikely, he added.\n\"I would not be optimistic of a resumption,\" he said.\nBritish Gas announced in September that talks on the sale of its domestic gas supply business in England and Scotland to Scottish Hydro had been called off, scotching newspaper reports that the sale would bring in around 250 million pounds.\nYoung said the breakdown was for administrative rather than commerical reasons.\n\"There was no serious commercial difficulty that caused the project to be dropped...British Gas had a lot of competition for its (administrative) resources,\" he said.\nBut he said the moment for the deal might now have passed. \"Deals tend to have their day,\" he said, adding that there . were other discussions around, \"but nothing that we can talk about.\" ($1=.6034 Pound)\n", "Humana Inc. reported lower quarterly profits Tuesday, mainly due to charges for restructuring, but the stock in the big health maintenance organization rose on optimism over its new president's ambitious turnaround plan.\nThe 4.9-million member HMO -- fifth largest in the United States among for-profit HMOs -- posted fourth-quarter net income of $22 million, or 13 cents a share, after charges, down from $49 million, or 30 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter.\nQuarterly premium revenues were $1.81 billion, up from $1.49 billion in the year-ago period.\nFor the full year, Humana said net income plunged 94 percent to $12 million, or 7 cents a share, from $190 million, or $1.17 a share. The company reported revenues of $6.7 billion, up from $4.6 billion in 1995.\nThe stock of the Louisville, Ky.-based Humana rose 37.5 cents to $18.75 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $19.25.\n\"What the stock is responding to is Humana's outlining a pretty aggressive action plan. ... They're making the organization more lean and mean,\" said Gary Frazier, a health care industry analyst with the Bear Sterns brokerage.\nWhen Gregory Wolf became president of Humana in September, he took over a company that once had led the managed health care industry, but had more recently seen its star fade as it expanded into unprofitable areas.\nWolf had previously been president of Emphesys Financial Group Inc., which Humana acquired in October 1995.\nWith the help of a new executive staff, Wolf is pushing through a tough plan to cut costs and withdraw Humana from money-losing markets.\n\"He's made some very intelligent moves,\" said Ed Keaney, health-care industry analyst with the Volpe Welty brokerage.\nIn the fourth quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $10 million after taxes related mainly to severance costs for elimination of 700 to 900 jobs this year from its roughly 18,000-member work force.\nThe company has sold or is selling money-losing operations in Alabama, Washington, D.C., and other markets.\nIn the second quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $130 million after taxes to restructure the Washington health plan, provide for expected insurance losses, close 13 service areas and discontinue unprofitable products in three markets.\nAs a result, the company said total enrollment in its commercial health care plans fell by 69,100 members last year, by 87,500 members in January alone and is expected to decline by 115,000 members this quarter.\n\"Our plans to withdraw from certain markets and price business commensurate with the underlying risk are proceeding on schedule,\" Wolf said.\nThe company's medical-loss ratio -- a key measure of profitability -- improved to 82.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 83.1 percent in the third quarter, but was up from 81.5 percent in the year-ago period.\nAnalysts said they were impressed with Wolf's plan for reversing Humana's fortunes but noted the company unveiled a turnaround plan once before that was never fully achieved.\n\"I want to see a little more of a turn in earnings before I'm sure this action plan is taking hold,\" Frazier said.\n", "U.S. President Bill Clinton's commitment to pursue a deeper dialogue with Beijing in his State of the Union address is likely to reassure China that Washington is ready to take it seriously, analysts said on Wednesday.\nThe weight Clinton gave to boosting prickly cross-Pacific relations and his vow to visit China would be welcome signals from an administration that long appeared to put Beijing far down its list of priorities, said one Western diplomat.\n\"One of the things that has upset China about the Clinton administration is that it hasn't been treated as important enough,\" the diplomat said.\n\"The Clinton administration has now really realised the importance of Sino-U.S. relations,\" echoed a senior Chinese expert on U.S. policy.\n\"This year, it seems the Clinton administration plans to resolve Sino-U.S. problems and implement new policies,\" said the expert, who declined to be identified.\nIn his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Clinton said a deeper dialogue with China was vital for U.S. interests and vowed to exchange visits with Chinese President Jiang Zemin to boost cooperation and deal frankly with Sino-U.S. differences.\n\"An isolated China is not good for America,\" Clinton said. \"A China playing its proper role in the world is.\"\nThe U.S. president's remarks came after months of rapid warming in a Sino-U.S. relationship that for years had been buffeted by diplomatic disputes over such issues as Taiwan, trade, copyright piracy and human rights.\nThe improvement in relations was bolstered by a series of high-level contacts, successful textile trade negotiations and by the charm offensive Beijing had aimed at members of the often-hostile U.S. Congress, the analysts said.\nBut weary diplomats in Beijing and Washington would have plenty of new worries to cope with in coming months, they said.\nU.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright's visit to China this month, while hailed by China as a boost to ties, would bring problems of its own if she followed through on promises to talk straight on Beijing's rights record, the diplomat said.\n\"If she has decided she's going to talk about human rights, the Chinese might not find it a very pleasant time,\" he said.\nWashington's expected decision to back a motion condemning China for its rights policies at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva would also strain the new amity, he said.\n\"Those are the first few bumps that the relationship has to negotiate,\" he said.\nBeijing was coming to believe that the Clinton administration was not the main source of U.S. opposition on such issues as human rights, the Chinese expert said.\n\"The Clinton administration doesn't want to pay more attention to the human rights issue, but it is under strong pressure from the U.S. media and Congress,\" he said.\nThe U.S. Congress was also the main stumbling block slowing China's entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), he said.\nBeijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the preferential terms accorded developing nations, has long accused Washington of sabotaging its accession.\nThe Western diplomat said Beijing leaders were finally realising the importance of courting Congress, which China had for too long seen as no more than an equivalent of their own docile legislature.\nSenior Chinese leaders have in recent weeks given visiting congressmen a warm welcome and the nation's propaganda machine has been relatively restrained in its reaction to a U.S. government report strongly critical of Beijing's rights record.\nChina's initially mild reaction to the report was a positive sign, the Western diplomat said. However he noted that Beijing had taken weeks to respond to a similar 1995 report and then unleashed a 7,000-word tirade blasting Washington.\nSuch a diplomatic broadside could still emerge to rock ties this year, but it was unlikely to be quite as long, he said.\n", "Hong Kong's democracy movement leader Martin Lee made a triumphant return to the territory on Monday after upstaging future leader Tung Chee-hwa by winning support from Washington for political freedoms.\nThe head of the Hong Kong Democratic Party became a media star in the United States where he clinched a White House meeting with President Bill Clinton, who promised U.S. support after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1.\nJubilant and relaxed after a hectic month-long, 12-city tour to the United States, Canada and Switzerland, Lee said he was convinced Hong Kong had friends throughout the world who were anxious to preserve its freedoms after China takes over.\nLee said governments in the West had a moral responsibility to see that China abides by its treaty pledge of allowing Hong Kong's freewheeling lifestyle to endure for another 50 years.\nHong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to Chinese rule at midnight June 30 under a 1984 treaty.\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's handover promises the territory quasi autonomy in all areas except defence and foreign affairs.\nBut many in the bustling territory of 6.4 million fear a loss of fundamental freedoms after the handover, now just 71 days away.\nThe territory is plagued by a host of handover woes ranging from China's plan to replace the elected legislature with one carefully crafted by Beijing, to curbs on protests and a ban on foreign funding for political groups.\nLee, whose return coincided with the arrival of an advance party of China's army to prepare for the coming of the rest of the garrison on July 1, told Hong Kong people to take heart.\n\"We're not fighting alone for human rights and democracy in Hong Kong. We have many friends in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and Europe,\" he said.\n\"People are very concerned about Hong Kong and preservation of its freedoms as guaranteed by the Joint Declaration.\n\"We reminded the U.S. government and all other governments that supported the Joint Declaration...they owe Hong Kong at least a moral responsibility to make sure the rule of law, civil liberties are preserved after the sovereignty changeover.\"\nLast week at the White House, Lee won an assurance that Hong Kong was important to the United States and a warning from Clinton to China to abide by its Joint Declaration commitments.\nLee's return, after scoring his political victory in Washington, provided a counterpoint to the falling popularity of future leader Tung, who will govern Hong Kong from July 1.\nSharply criticised for his plans to ban foreign funding of political groups and curb protests, Tung found himself the subject of a scandal after he admitted having donated 50,000 sterling (US$81,500) to Britain's Conservative Party in 1992.\nLee vowed he and his party members would not give up their fight to preserve Hong Kong's freedoms, but he admitted he was deeply worried that Tung would press ahead with his plans.\n\"If Mr Tung stops us, and (the plans) become law, we will have to decide what to do,\" he said.\nLee's party raised HK$2.5 million (US$323,000) from Chinese communities during its month-long tour.

Skoda holds a majority stake in ETI.\nThe Dayton supply is scheduled to be completed in 1998.

The merger, completed in April, created a company with a market capitalisation of more than three billion pounds.\nThe group owns British national newspapers The Daily and Sunday Express and Daily Star and operates commercial television (ITV) franchises in southern and eastern England.\nShare analysts said that extensive restructuring meant that most of the merger benefits would not feed through until next year and some complained that the results were unnecessarily hard to decipher.\n\"There are huge exceptional items and I think the progress will come next year but the jury is still out,\" said one, reflecting a general sentiment. \"They're spending a 100 million pounds to reshape the business and it will be a long payback.\"\nChief executive Lord Hollick said that a review of the group's businesses would be completed by the end of the year.\n\"This year's accounts will tell the full story,\" he said.\nReviewing the merger, chairman Lord Stevens said in a statement: \"One-off costs will be significant and to date amount to 56.4 million pounds\".\nUnited will take an 82 million pound profit on the sale of specialist legal publisher Tolley in its full year figures.

It also faces costs of up to 30 million pounds from its share in Britain's new Channel 5 television station.\nThe merger spawned an unlikely management team of Stevens and Hollick, dubbed \"The Odd Couple\" by the British press.\nHollick, formerly MAI's managing director, is a staunch supporter of the opposition Labour Party, while Stevens' Express newspapers reflect his backing for the ruling Conservatives.\nUnited last week announced a plan to put the Daily and Sunday Express titles under a seven-day editorial team in an attempt to halt a long-term decline.\nHollick said the newspapers had been \"starved of investment\" and vowed to plough 10 million pounds back into Express annually in each of the next three years.

It will supplement the existing airport at Hongqiao to the west.\nBut airline representatives said there was no indication which airport they will be required to operate from after 1999 or what arrangements will be made for them.\nMany said they understood the Pudong airport, 30 km (18 miles) from the city centre, would handle international flights and Hongqiao domestic ones.\n\"But I think that, from an airline perspective, it would not be wise to limit either airport to solely international or domestic traffic,\" said one airline executive who asked not to be named.\n\"I know they have plans for new infrastructure but I'm not going to hold my breath for some sort of rapid transit route from Pudong to Hongqiao,\" he said.\nTraffic in Shanghai is very congested, although city officials say the problem will be eased by a network of elevated highways being constructed around and through the city.\nLu Jianhua, an official with the Pudong airport planning office, said the current plan was to have both international and domestic flights operating from both airports, but that final arrangements had not been settled.\n\"The specifics of flight assignments to the two airports still need to be decided,\" Lu said.\nThe first phase of Pudong airport will include a 4,000-metre runway and a 150,000 square metre main building, costing a total of 12 billion yuan ($1.46 billion).\nThe airport at that point will be able to accommodate 20 million passengers and 750,000 tonnes of air cargo, more than double the present capacity of Hongqiao.\nThe whole Pudong airport project, to be completed in 15-20 years, calls for four runways and an annual capacity of 70 million passengers and five million tonnes of air cargo.\nLu said a new unified administration would be created to manage both Hongqiao and Pudong airports. They are currently two separate entities and foreign airline executives said they sensed a competitiveness between the two.\nAsked which airport he would prefer to operate from, one airline representative said: \"We're not going to be given a choice, we will go where they tell us to go.\n\"But I don't know anything about Pudong. I haven't seen any drawings. We haven't been asked to participate in the design, although we have offered,\" he added.\nDesign of the airport terminal has been won by a French consortium, Aeroports de Paris, but the representative said the foreign airlines wanted to have input into the design as early as possible.\n\"We are concerned because Hongqiao airport is massively inadequate today, despite the fact that it's as good as any large airport in China. We are concerned that, without some input from us, we may end the same way in Pudong,\" he said.\n", "Microsoft Corp. said its third-quarter profit jumped 85 percent to $1.04 billion, well beyond analysts' expectations, on strength in its core Windows business and the new Office 97 upgrade.\nThe software giant's net income of 79 cents a share compared with earnings of $562 million, or 44 cents a share, in last year's fiscal third quarter. Revenues rose to a record $3.21 billion, a 45 percent increase over the $2.21 billion racked up in the year-ago quarter.\nAnalysts on average had forecast earnings of 64 cents a share and revenues of about $2.9 billion.\nWhile Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated that he expects growth to slow over the next year, analysts said they were impressed by the software giant's continuing ability to rack up huge gains.\n\"I was floored,\" said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie, who predicted the stock would rise sharply Friday as analysts jack up their earnings estimates. \"This was a 16-cylinder engine, and all cylinders were working.\"\nMicrosoft released the results after financial markets closed. In Nasdaq trading Thursday Microsoft fell 12.5 cents to $98.125, but the stock rose as high as $102.75 in after-hours trading, dealers said.\nMicrosoft credited strong revenues from the Office 97 bundle, released in January, which helped drive application and content revenues to $1.53 billion, up 24 percent from the year-earlier period.\nBut revenues from Microsoft's platform products, including the various Windows operating systems, rose 73 percent to $1.68 billion.\nSales of software preloaded on new computers to the so-called OEM (original equipment manufacturer) channel, rose 51 percent, faster than the PC growth rate, reflecting a continued shift to the higher-priced Windows 95 operating system from the older Windows 3.x.\nIn an interview, Brown said he expected growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons with year-earlier quarters and a lack of planned major new upgrades.\nBrown said he was \"very excited\" about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an \"all-time Olympic record.\"\n\"We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS (earnings per share) went up 80 percent,\" he said. \"That's not a quarter-in, quarter-out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter.\"\nIn fact, he said results from the current fourth quarter would be roughly equivalent to the period that just ended, and he predicted a modest sequential decline in revenues and earnings in the seasonally slow September quarter. But after that sequential growth should resume, Brown said.\nBecause Microsoft exceeded third-quarter expectations by 15 cents per share, analysts likely will have to raise fiscal 1997 estimates to about $2.65 per share from the previous $2.35, McAdams said. Fiscal 1998 estimates also are likely to be raised, he said.\nMcAdams also pointed out that the company's \"unearned\" revenues of $1.29 billion included an additional 13 cents per share that was taken in but not recognized as earnings in the quarter. Microsoft defers some revenues to account for costs over the life cycle of products such as Windows and Office.\nWhile Microsoft routinely beats earnings estimates, analysts said they had not even heard a \"whisper\" of the blowout number, and Microsoft's stock has traded in a relatively narrow range over the past two months.\n\"It's just an extraordinarily well-managed company to deliver that kind of earnings upside on this size of a revenue base,\" said analyst David Readerman of Montgomery Securities.\n", "British food manufacturer Dalgety Plc posted an 8.5 percent fall in profits on Monday to 43 million pounds ($70.5 million) in the six months to December 31, 1996 as sales of its beef and animal feeds slid.\nThe company was hit by evidence showing that the brain wasting disease Bovine Spongiform Encepthalopathy (BSE) in cattle, known as mad-cow disease, could spread to humans who ate infected meat.\nThe European Union imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports last March and insisted on the slaughter of thousands of British cattle, a cull which has been delayed.\nBut Dalgety chief executive Richard Clothier said things should improve. \"During the second half the continued improvements in Petfoods, new capacity and new products in Food Ingredients and the declining effects of BSE in Dalgety Agriculture are expected to result in a much improved performance,\" said Clothier.\nAnalysts had forecast pre-tax profits of 41-45.5 million pounds. Dalgety maintained its dividend at 8.5p in anticipation of a better second half performance.\n\"The figures are pretty much as flagged in terms of what it tells us about the shape, size and direction of the company,\" said UBS analyst Charles Mills.\nDalgety shares were up 2p at 341p in early trade, helped by positive remarks from Clothier.\nThe export ban on British beef affected Dalgety's manufacturing organisation and temporarily resulted in higher costs of outsourcing and distribution.\nIn Petfoods, Dalgety improved trading profit by eight percent to 17.9 million pounds in the first half, helped by cat food, with sales of the Felix brand up 16 percent across Europe.\nOperating profit from the company's agri-business fell 23 percent to 15 million pounds as a direct result of the effects of BSE on British cattle feed.\n\"Sales volumes of cattle feed for the six months period fell by 30 percent, as the delay in the culling programme resulted in excess milk production which reduced the demand for feed and created intense price competition in the market,\" said Clothier.\nOperating profit from food ingredients was steady at 15.3 million pounds as fears over BSE reduced the sales of meat seasonings in the first quarter. But demand for alternatives had now offset the decline in beef-based foods, Clothier said.\nIn food distribution, Dalgety's profits fell seven percent to 5.6 million due in part to the strength of sterling against the dollar. Growth in the American fast food market slowed, affecting hamburger chain McDonald's sales, said Clothier.\n\"The outlook remains tough in the U.S. but McDonald's are responding with vigour and developments in new markets such as Brazil and Mexico provide good opportunities for future growth,\" he added.\nThe group's net debt increased to 305 million pounds from 281 million, giving a gearing ratio of 76 percent.

But I can't tell you if it's two weeks or six weeks or eight weeks.\"\nBoeing Chairman Phil Condit, in Brussels for a meeting with European regulators, said a sale to Delta was far from certain.\n\"We are in a very strong competition at Delta,\" Condit told a meeting organised by the European Aviation Club. \"We have not reached any agreement at this point.\"\nBoeing stock rose $2 to $108.125 in New York Stock Exchange trading, and Delta gained $1.125 to $85.75.\nDelta's current fleet of 531 jets is two-thirds Boeing, including some older narrow-body planes that need to be replaced or modified to meet upcoming noise requirements.\nA Boeing spokeswoman said the manufacturer was offering Delta its wide-body, twin-jet 777, although the airline also is considering the slightly smaller 767-400ERX, which is not yet in production, a fact Airbus is emphasising.\n\"If they would want something right away they take one of current airplanes Boeing has or the (Airbus) A330, so that's where the battle is,\" said Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.\nNick Heymann, an analyst at Natwest Securities, said the potential Delta deal could have \"huge ramifications for the future of how airlines get their equipment.\"\n\"Boeing's strategy here is to be able to have such a complete product line that all their derivatives will be able to meet all their customers' needs even as their customers' markets fragment,\" he said.\nThe \"one-stop shopping\" concept is spreading across the aviation industry as manufacturers seek to increase their share of the lucrative market in services, Heymann said.\nJust this week Boeing said it would eliminate its money-losing training organisation and instead offer training for commercial jet pilots and mechanics in a joint venture with Flight Safety International.\nGeneral Electric Co. expanded its aircraft engine servicing business by agreeing to acquire Greenwich Air Services Inc. and UNC Inc. for a total of $875 million plus the assumption of debt.\nA deal with Delta would be similar to the agreement struck with American, a unit of AMR Corp., last year worth at least $6.5 billion over the next five years and up to $25 billion or more over 20 years.\nBut Wolfgang Demisch, analyst at BT Securities, pointed out that while the American deal has been described as a firm long-term commitment for the airline to buy all its jets from the Seattle-based manufacturer, it does not legally bind the carrier to accept prices that are not competitive.\n\"I view it as more of a statement of intent than anything else,\" he said. Given recent strong airline traffic, rising profits and expectations of growth, he said Delta would be tempted to accept Boeing's offer, which presumably guarantees competitive prices.\nAnalyst Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities disagreed, saying Delta management has been historically conservative, particularly compared with American's, and would be less likely to go with a single source.\n\"If you do that you lose the ability to pit each manufacturer off each other every time an order comes up,\" he said.\n", "In another sign of Britain's slow retreat from Hong Kong before its handover to China, the British army on Friday packed up its radio station -- literally into a shipping container.\nBritain departs its colony of more than 150 years at midnight on June 30 and the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) plans to keep broadcasting until the very last moment, but not from its old studio in military headquarters.\nIn an informal ceremony to the tones of a lone bagpiper, Commodore Peter Melson, chief of staff of the British forces in the territory, declared the new BFBS station open in a standard 20-foot container.\nThe air-conditioned container sits alongside an office block at the Prince of Wales Barracks on Hong Kong's harbour front and comes replete with disc-jockey, studio equipment and soundproof styrofoam walls.\n\"It works!\" Melson declared to reporters as he stepped out of the container -- commissioned for use in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War -- after a token inspection.\nA staff of 15 who used to occupy two proper studios at the barracks will keep the station going until the handover although \"the shack\", as it is called by its users, itself will be loaded on the supply and troop ship Sir Percivale on June 29.\nThe extension to the Hong Kong Convention Centre, where the grand handover ceremony will be held, can be seen from container's sole window.\n\"I'm sure there'll be something in the last hours. It's not something we'll let go easily, not after so long,\" Melson said.\nBFBS, with a network of other stations, has operated since 1971 in Hong Kong, where it hit a peak staff strength of 45 in 1990. It broadcasts non-stop news and programmes from Britain.\nThe British army has been packing up since last year, leaving only a skeletal force just before the handover.\nMelson said BFBS has been more than a mere radio station to the garrison in the territory.\n\"It's meant an awful lot over the years, having our own radio station in Hong Kong. It's something we've been able to relate to, to talk to, have requests from loved ones at home.\n", "Hong Kong's future government has hit a new snag, with a shortage of trained staff forcing it to cancel a sitting of a controversial legislature preparing new laws ahead of the territory's handover to China.\nIt is the latest in a series of difficulties facing Tung Chee-hwa, the China-backed shipping magnate who will rule Hong Kong after the British pull out at midnight on June 30.\nTung's office said on Wednesday  thatthis Saturday's session of the provisional legislature, which had been scheduled to deal with a draft law on new flags, had been dropped from the diary. Just a briefing would take place.\n\"The draft bills aren't ready because there aren't enough people,\" Bob Howlett, a spokesman for Tung's office, told Reuters. He said Tung's coordinator, Michael Suen, concluded the office did not have enough draftsmen to prepare planned laws.\n\"He doesn't want to see a rushed job done on anything,\" Howlett said.\nBritish Governor Chris Patten has refused to second more staff to the Tung office from the Hong Kong civil service to help the future government ready itself for the handover.\nThe office has only two law drafters on its staff.\nCommunist-ruled China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong, a British colony for the last 156 years, under a 1984 treaty that allows the territory virtual autonomy for another 50 years.\nChina, angered by democratic reforms introduced by Patten in the twilight years of British rule, set up the provisional legislature in December to replace the democratically elected Legislative Council (Legco).\nMany of China's critics consider the interim body unconstitutional.\n\"I think it's a good thing there's now no legislation going forward this week, and it would be even better if no legislation goes forward at any time, because anything they do handle between now and June 30 is vulnerable to legal challenge after the first of July,\" said Patten's spokesman, Kerry McGlynn.\n\"That can't be in anybody's interests. We've always made it perfectly plain, and will continue to do so up to June 30, that we'll do nothing to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the current Legco by providing any kind of assistance to the provisional legislature,\" McGlynn told Reuters.\nA spokesman for the provisional legislature said the body would now organise a briefing on Saturday on the planned civil rights curbs, instead of a full-fledged legislative session, at its base in the Chinese border town of Shenzhen.\nTung's run-up to his new job as Hong Kong chief executive has been a bumpy one.\nSino-British disputes were stoked this month after Tung launched a plan to curb political liberties such as the right to protest and the right of political groups to receive foreign funds. He provoked a domestic and international outcry.\nLast week he admitted to the media that he had donated 50,000 stg ($81,500) to the ruling British Conservative Party in 1992, sparking cries of hypocrisy.\n\"They seem they can't get their act together,\" a government official said of the latest setback. \"Tung's office is finding it nigh impossible to do the drafting, even though they still seem determined to go head with it.\n\"The Chinese side has painted itself into a corner with the provisional legislature. They've got themselves into a real pickle.\"\n", "Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) on Tuesday gave investment grade ratings to three of the four largest Czech banks, but said the high marks were partly due to an implied safety net for the banks provided by the state.\nIn its first quality debt ratings for commercial banks in former communist Europe, S&amp;P gave long-term ratings of BBB-minus to Komercni Banka a.s., Ceska Sporitelna a.s. , and  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s..\nIt also issued all three banks short-term ratings of A3 for counterparty risk in trade with other banks.\nThe ratings fell short of the Czech Republic's sovereign rating of A, but were similar to the marks issued to the Slovak, Polish, and Greek central banks, and one grade above Hungarian sovereign debt.\nBut in explaining the ratings, S&amp;P said the three banks' size and position in the market made it \"highly likely that the Czech government would provide support\" if needed.\nThus, the ratings were higher than they would have been if based solely on each bank's financial situation.\nS&amp;P did not give a rating for the third largest Czech bank, IPB a.s., which is waiting for a roughly one-third stake to be privatised in a tender later this spring.\nS&amp;P said Komercni had 25 percent of Czech deposits, 26 percent of the credit market and conducted 10 percent of total trading on the Prague Stock Exchange last year.\n\"Given the bank's size, its importance to the country's financial system, and position in the market, S&amp;P believes state support would be forthcoming if required in the future, although no formal guarantee exists,\" it said of Komercni, the country's largest commercial bank.\nIt said that Komercni's classified loans totalled 35.4 percent at the end of September and its outlook was stable.\nKomercni's deputy general director Borivoj Prazak told reporters after the announcement that the bank was \"very glad\" to receive the ratings. \"We held our ground,\" despite slower than expected Czech macroeconomic growth, he said.\nAs with the other two banks, the Czech government has a major stake in Komcerni, 48.7 percent.\nThe government has said it plans to privatise all state-held banks, so getting the ratings based on the tacit state safety net adds more intrigue to the debate over the speed and extent of Czech banking privatisation.\nS&amp;P noted that Sporitelna, the former Communist savings bank where virtually all deposits were kept, was still \"the most important player in Czech retail banking\" but said it \"remains vulnerable to further problems within the sector\".\n\"(Sporitelna's) asset quality problems remain a concern with customer loans classified as non-standard amounting to 43.6 billion crowns ($1.58 billion), representing 31.8 percent of gross customer loans at year-end 1995,\" S&amp;P said.\nIt said that CSOB's ratings reflected the bank's strong position in foreign trade financing and its joint ownership by the Czech and Slovak governments.\nThe S&amp;P report said CSOB's non-standard loan level had dropped to 41 percent of gross customer loans by the end of 1995 from 51 percent at the end of the previous year.\n($1=27.52 Czech Crown)\n", "Britain's opposition Labour Party outlined its blueprint for transport on Tuesday pledging no sell-off of the London Underground system, a partnership with the private sector on investment and a review of rail and bus regulation.\nLabour leader Tony Blair kicked off the proceedings at an Industry Forum conference on transport by backing a public-private partnership to inject more investment into the cash-strapped metro system.\n\"It would offer Londoners a way between the status quo and dogmatic wholesale privatisation,\" he said.\nThe theme of partnership was emphasised by Blair and shadow transport secretary Andrew Smith who has shifted sharply away from the more interventionist policy approach of his predecessor Clare Short, according to transport industry figures.\nLabour's revised transport vision promised tougher regulation, but no longer spoke of reversing the rail sell-off.\nInstead, Smith said he envisaged using the private sector to invest in track maintenance, signalling, new trains and tunnel maintenance through long-term agreements for the underground.\nOn the overland rail network, Labour said it would be pushing policies which resulted in less road building and more traffic management.\nThis would be underscored by initiatives to tempt more passengers out of their cars and onto rail and buses. But Blair said the party did not want to \"demonise\" cars.\n\"I want to see an end to the debate couched in terms of road versus rail'. I am not interested in demonising the motor car. The focus of government policy needs to be offering people attractive alternatives to using their car. The task has to be getting a sustainable balance in car use,\" he told the conference.\nAs part of its effort to beef up the transport system as a viable alternative to cars, Labour promised a review of the regulation of buses and rail.\nOn rail, Smith criticised privatised infrastructure company Railtrack Plc for not meeting its investment obligations.\n\"As a natural monopoly whose performance is critical for the whole system, Railtrack must be held to account for the quality and effectiveness as well as the financial value of its investment programme and its property disposals. The first call on those should be for investment,\" said Smith.\nLabour -- which leads in pinion polls ahead of a general election which must be held by May -- plans a four-point plan to move more freight onto rail and off roads.\nAs part of the that plan, Railtrack would be given more of a responsibility to develop freight business under a proposed code of conduct.\nThis would require Railtrack to provide information and introduce procedures for dealing with new freight business requests as part of a general obligaiton to promote develop freight. This would be enforced by the rail regulator, said Labour.\nThe freight plan also includes safeguarding of sites for depots under planning guidlines and raising safety and emission standards for road haulage. On regulation, Labour said said there was a need for a new framework for buses and the beefing up of the rail regulator's powers.\nOn compeititon law, Labour would launch a review to see whether changes are needed to allow co-operation between bus companies on issues like ticketing and time-tabling where it can benefit customers - an issue the industry has lobbied on.\nLabour said Britain's lack of an integrated transport policy was already costing it 20 billion pounds ($32.07 billion) per annum, according to a survey from the Confederation of British Industry.\n($1=.6237 Pound)\n", "International Business Machines Corp said its $23 billion Global Services business is to become a separate IBM group, acknowledging the significance of the fast-growing business.\nIn a related development, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner reiterated in the company's annual report on Wednesday that the company planned to hire \"thousands more\" employees to fuel growth, most of them in Global Services.\nIBM told analysts earlier this year it would probably add as many new employees in 1997 as it did in 1996, with a big chunk in Global Services.\nIn 1996, the computer giant's worldwide headcount grew to 241,000, up from 225,000 in 1995, mostly due to the expanding services business, an IBM spokesman said. In 1995, employment grew from 220,000 in 1994, the first time employment had grown in 10 years.\n\"I'd like to add here that I am very happy -- and proud -- that our transformation has created job growth,\" Gerstner said in his letter to shareholders, in which he described 1996 overall as \"a solid year.\"\nWhen Gerstner first took over the then-struggling computer giant in April 1993, one of his first actions was to take a big restructuring charge and cut 25,000 jobs from IBM.\nThe Global Services unit -- which designs, installs and services computers, including running entire corporate computer systems -- was formerly part of IBM's Sales and Services group.\nSales and Services will be renamed the Sales and Distribution Group, still headed by IBM Senior Vice President Ned Lautenbach.\nIBM also said Dennie Welsh, who was general manager of Global Services, will be promoted to a senior vice president and report directly to Gerstner.\nWelsh was also named an IBM group executive and will join IBM's executive committee, which makes strategic decisions.\n\"The time is right for this change,\" Gerstner said in an IBM memo announcing the reorganisation. \"He (Welsh) and his colleagues on the services team have done an outstanding job building a great new business for IBM. This change not only reflects a logical adjustment in our organisational structure, but also a recognition of their success.\"\nIBM's services business has been its fastest growing in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter, IBM said services revenues jumped 22 percent to $5 billion. In comparison, IBM's total revenues grew 6 percent in the fourth quarter.\n\"This is a transformation of the IBM company,\" said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant. \"The major revenue stream is not coming from hardware, it will come from software and services ...\".\n\"This has some impact on the way IBM sees its future,\" Albert added. \"Anything this important demands direct oversight by Gerstner.\"\nWednesday's move follows changes in December when IBM consolidated computer services under the IBM Global Services brand. IBM's services organisation had been operating in some countries outside the United States under different names.\nThe addition of Global Services now gives IBM five major corporate divisions. The others are the Software Group, the Server Group, which makes the computers that run networks; the Personal Systems Group; and Sales and Distribution.\nWith Welsh's promotion to IBM senior vice president, the company now has a total of 10 senior vice presidents.\nIBM stock fell $1.50 to $137.857 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "China's war on destitution has been filling the pages of the state-controlled media, but the nation has little chance of meeting its target of wiping out absolute poverty by 2000, analysts said on Wednesday.\nA week of banner headlines and front-page stories trumpeting the anti-poverty resolve of China's communist leadership reflected more the political importance of impoverished regions than real confidence targets could be achieved, they said.\nBringing new wealth to the 65 million Chinese struggling to survive with annual incomes below the 530 yuan ($64) official absolute poverty line was a vital state goal, state media said.\n\"We know that it's not particularly realistic. You can't just wave a wand and suddenly all these people just disappear,\" said a Western diplomat who specialises in poverty issues.\n\"They have had really good progress in the last five years but they haven't reached those targets -- and there doesn't seem to be a great deal of momentum built up to be able to meet those targets,\" the diplomat said.\nState newspapers have packed their pages this week with months-old speeches and state resolutions, mixed with more recent reports of regional successes in easing the scourge of poverty in the nation's villages.\n\"Before the 21st century arrives, China will eliminate absolute poverty... The Chinese Communist Party will lead the people of the whole nation to cast off the stigma of destitution,\" said the Xinhua Daily Telegraph.\nBut in a commentary that accompanied the text of an October resolution on poverty, the official newspaper also appeared to reflect concern that high profile goals could be hard to meet.\nChina had been able to lift only an average of five million people a year from poverty over the last three years, less than half the targeted level, it said.\n\"If the pace of poverty alleviation in poor areas is not accelerated, that will mean the problem of feeding and sheltering around 40 million poor people will be carried into the next century,\" it said.\nEven if all Chinese could be assured an annual income above the official absolute poverty line, the gap between China's urban haves and rural have-nots would linger for many years, said a Chinese agricultural development analyst.\n\"There is a lot of work to be done,\" he said, adding that poverty remained an issue in the areas around some of China's most prosperous eastern and coastal cities.\n\"Even in Beijing suburbs there are mountainous areas where the average income is still low,\" he said. \"They are not poor by national standards but they are still far behind (urban residents).\"\nThe Western diplomat said one reason for the high profile accorded to anti-poverty pledges by senior leaders such as President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng was the need to placate local leaders in more backward regions.\nChina's inland provinces have long complained they are being left behind by booming coastal regions, prompting promises of a westward shift in investment to help them to catch up.\n\"On the political level I think (the publicity) is closely related to the issue of building up the western and central provinces,\" the diplomat said.\nIt was unclear what the political results of failure to reach the targets would be, she said.\n", "Even before Cie de Suez head Gerard Mestrallet has confirmed he is considering a merger with utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux, the market is already betting that will run the new group.\nBrokers, fed by newspaper reports and market rumours, are convinced financial conglomerate Suez and Lyonnaise will merge to create a utilities group with an estimated market capitalisation of 79 billion francs ($13.9 billion) that will give new life to both companies.\nA decision on who would head a merged group could play a key role in determining which company gains the upper hand in running the combined entity.\nTwo elements argue for the merger. Suez, after selling key assets to make good property losses, has a big cash hoard and 50 billion francs in capital -- but little industrial identity.\nAnd at Lyonnaise, chairman Jerome Monod, 66, is preparing his retirement. A merger would not only financially strengthen the company but give fresh leadership.\nOdds are heavily in favour of Mestrallet who took over Suez two years ago after a boardroom battle ousted then chairman Gerard Worms. Mestrallet was brought in from Suez's Belgian unit Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB).\n\"He's the favourite,\" said an analyst, who declined to be named. \"He has done an impressive job.\"\n\"Mestrallet has shown his worth,\" an investment banker said.\nHe sold key assets including investment bank Banque Indosuez and is credited for bringing Suez back to profit.\nThe company made a 1995 net attributable loss of 3.96 billion francs, due to provisions for property losses, but analysts expect it to report a 1996 net profit of about 1.15 billion francs.\nMestrallet has narrowed Suez's focus to utilities, held through its Tractebel subsidiary owned by SGB. But the company has been left with an \"identity problem\".\nSuez had become a \"piggy bank,\" stuffed with cash and equity capital, while Lyonnaise needs funds to finance its expansion.\nMestrallet, 47, son of a shopkeeper, graduated from the elite Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) and worked as chief of staff to Jacques Delors at the French Finance Ministry before his boss became president of the European Commission.\nHis rival for power is Guy de Panafieu, the number two to Monod at Lyonnaise.\nDe Panafieu, 53, is also a graduate of ENA, the fast-track school for senior posts in government and industry. He managed the integration of the troubled Dumez construction firm since its 1990 acquisition by Lyonnaise.\nBut de Panafieu, although seen as having handled Dumez well, is too closely identified with Monod, the analyst said.\n\"I do not really see it. He is in Monod's shadow and it is not in the spirit of the times to continue the same line.\"\nIn buying Dumez, Lyonnaise inherited foreign contracts which cost hundreds of millions in provisions as disputes grew. Lyonnaise, already struggling with property losses, had to sell assets to fund provisions for those contract disputes.\n\"The company has lost time and has sold everything. It does not have a lot of asset support\", said the analyst.\nOne outside contender is Christine Morin-Postel, who heads Suez's Credisuez unit, and who negotiated the sale of four billion francs of property loans to the Whitehall Street \"vulture fund\" led by broker Goldman Sachs.\nThe sale, among the biggest in French real estate disposals, is seen as the key to bringing Suez back into profit.\nMorin-Postel, 50, also knows Lyonnaise well, having held the international development post and a directorship in the GTM Entrepose construction subsidiary. Last July, British leisure group Rank Organisation Plc made Morin-Postel a non-executive director.

Bre-X has said it will issue a press release on the report before North American financial markets open on Monday.\nRumours have swirled around Busang since what has been called the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when Freeport-McMoRan said its preliminary tests found \"insignificant\" amounts of gold.\nBre-X has estimated Busang contains about 71 million ounces of gold, potentially the largest in the world.\nPanic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's stock market value last month, wiping out 80 percent of its market worth.\nFreeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday the request for the extension was made within the past week.\n\"The original agreement with Bre-X signed on February 26 said that FCX's due diligence expired on April 30. This is really just to announce that we had pushed that date to June 30 to allow time for completion of the independent audit by Strathcona,\" Lemkau said in a telephone interview.\nLemkau declined to comment when asked if Freeport planned any further drilling at Busang over the next two months.\nBre-X shares led fell 32 cents Canadian (23 cents) to C$3.48 ($2.52) in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nSome investors on an Internet chat page speculated that Freeport's extension was favourable to Bre-X, but mining analysts cautioned against reading too much into the announcement.\n\"I don't think we should read into the request, although obviously investors are,\" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.\n\"Everybody is reading a lot into the rumours. But really they are just rumours right now,\" another Canadian mining analyst said.\nAn Indonesian newspaper, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier this week that leaked results of Strathcona's drill tests showed \"cheerful\" grades of gold.\nBut in a report in the Calgary Sun newspaper on Wednesday, Strathcona President Graham Farquharson said it was unlikely that his company's findings had been leaked.\n\"I still haven't seen the results myself -- the assays are still under way. So I have to doubt the claim,\" Farquharson was quoted as saying by the Sun. \"To the best of my knowledge there've been no leaks,\" he said.\nStrathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada, Indonesia and Australia.\nOnly one or two persons in management at each laboratory would have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished.\nStrathcona has said its final report to Bre-X would be delivered about six weeks after an interim report.\n", "Czech blue chip shares closed mostly higher on the Prague Stock Exchange on Wednesday, helping spur the bourse to its third consecutive advancing session.\nCEZ, Komercni Banka, Chemopetrol and Ceska Sporitelna all gained ground to boost the PX50 index 3.1 points, or 0.57 percent, to 550.4.

It has been depressed for the past 18 months and now it is about to go manic,\" said Greg Matthew, executive director of equities at fund managers Mercantile Mutual.\nUnder the deal, News Corp, which owns the U.S. Fox television network, would contribute satellites, cash and other assets of US$1 billion from its American Sky Broadcasting (AskyB) unit in return for a 50 percent stake in EchoStar. MCI Communications Corp, a partner in ASkyB and nine percent sharehodler in News Corp, will hold 10 percent of the venture, News will hold 40 percent and EchoStar 50 percent.  \nThe deal is estimated to be worth about A$2.6 billion to Murdoch's media empire or about 65 cents per News Corp share, one Sydney-based broker said.\nOfficials with both companies said the alliance would enable the company to respond to the growing popularity for pay television services, currently dominated by cable TV operators.\n\"Our goal is not to be complimentary to cable, we want to eliminate cable,\" said Charles Ergen, chief executive officer of EchoStar. The service is scheduled to start in early 1998.  \n\"Jointly we will create a dynamic and promising new competitive force in the subscription marketplace,\" Murdoch said in a statement.\nThe alliance will operate under the Sky name and is expected to lose around US$500 million in its first year but it should reach break-even by 1999 and generate more than US$1 billion in operating cash flow by the year 2002, the companies said.\n\"Everyone thought AskyB would break even probably as far out as 2003, they are now saying it would break even by 1999, so the market quite likes that,\" one Sydney-based broker said.  \nThe deal is also likely to step up the challenge to existing U.S. satellite television operators, DirecTV, which is owned by General Motors Corp's Hughes Electronics and AT&amp;T Corp, and Primestar, which is owned by of cable TV operators.\nNews Corp, also controls Britain's leading pay-TV provider BSkyB Plc and has a satellite TV joint venture in Japan, JSkyB, that is expected to begin full service next year.\nMurdoch also confirmed at a news conference after the deal announcement that News Corp has held friendly talks with Japanese electronics and entertainment gaint Sony Corp about Sony acquiring a stake in JSkyB.  \nBrokers said they also liked the News Corp comments that it planned to sell US$800 million of non-core assets and that it had raised its earnings forecast for its U.S. TV interests by US$500 million over the next three years.\nThe new Sky service is expected to include seven satellites, more than 500 channels, retransmission of local TV stations in markets representing more than 75 percent of all U.S. television households and low consumer entry cost.  \n-- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n", "The great Internet gold rush may be over, some high-technology industry executives say, but they see a silver lining: continued growth for leading high-tech companies.\n\"The Internet gold rush is over. We've had this big phenomenon, but there's not a lot of gold there,\" Frank Gill, executive vice president and general manager of Intel Corp.'s Internet and Communications Group, said in an interview on the eve of Wednesday's Spring Internet World 97 conference.\nGill is one of five keynote speakers at the Los Angeles conclave, which is expected to produce a blizzard of new product announcements from Internet start-up companies, many of them based in California's Silicon Valley.\nIn additon to Intel's Gill, top executives from computer makers Apple Computer Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. are expected to speak at the conference.\nThe Internet start-up explosion reached its peak nearly a year ago, when some Internet companies changed the rules of raising money in stock markets, where three years of profitability were considered a prerequisite for going public.\nYahoo! Inc., for example, went public at a valuation that peaked in initial trading at over $1 billion on its first day of trading despite less than a year of full operating history and no assurance of profits in the foreseeable future.\nDespite the brakes applied to the Internet public offering market last summer, venture capital investment continues at a strong pace and major corporations are now going onto the World Wide Web, which continues to grow at a rapid clip.\nStart-ups with innovative products -- including technology that \"pushes\" news and software content to users instead of making them go out and get it and so-called intelligent agents that help sift through the huge mass of data on the Internet -- are expected to flock to the conference floor hoping to flaunt their wares.\n\"I don't think the number of start-ups will slow down (but) their dreams for (stock) valuations will be more realistic,\" said Gill, who is due to address the conference Thursday.\nNow people are \"hunkering down\" to focus on providing value to consumers and value to business, Gill said, adding that Intel itself has invested in smaller companies with pioneering technology and sought to foster new technologies, such as modems that run on cable televison systems and making telephone calls over the Internet.\nGill sees JamTV, a new online music network developed with Digital Entertainment Networks, as an example of new Internet capabilities which also drive demand for higher-performance computers.\nFor Intel, he said, the Internet is a \"wonderful opportunity\" because it could drive demand for more PC sales.\nThe Internet World conference will be the next battleground in the war between Internet pioneer Netscape Communications Corp. and software giant Microsoft Corp. for leadership in the Internet software market.\nIt also will give Apple Computer Chief Executive Gil Amelio another chance Wednesday to spell out his struggling company's Internet strategy, which he has said is core to its turnaround efforts, just two days before he is due to announce further layoffs in a fresh restructuring.\nWhatever the plight of individual companies, industry executives at a conference held near San Francisco Tuesday said they saw no slowdown in Internet demand.\n\"We've seen over 300 percent growth in our backbone in 1996,\" said Robert Hagens, director of MCI Communications Corp.'s Network MCI Service, referring to the company's core Internet service lines.\n", "Toronto's stock market ended weaker in thin dealings on Monday, negatively influenced by New York's sell-off.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index fell 28.62 points to 5797.65.\nThe session was quiet, with 64.8 million shares trading hands worth C$1.02 billion (US$730 million).\n\"They got a little nervous in New York and the investors ran for the sidelines,\" said ScotiaMcLeod's senior vice-president Fred Ketchen. \"That certainly spilled over into the Canadian market as well.\"\nWall Street fell as investors reconsidered previous worries of U.S. interest rate hikes.\nSince the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained about five percent last week and Toronto rose nearly 2.5 percent, investors decided to take Wall Street farther down, Ketchen said.\nEleven of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes dropped, led by consumer products, pipelines, conglomerates and retail.

Options would bring the total to 644 aircraft.\nThe Delta deal, potentially worth more than $15 billion, follows a similar \"exclusive\" deal between Boeing and AMR Corp's American Airlines.\n\"We are not afraid of competition, we can sell our planes on their own merits,\" said an Airbus spokeswoman. She said Boeing was trying to buy out the competition with exclusive deals which lock an airline into a long-term commitment.\n\"It's destroying competition\" in the long term, she said.\nSuch deals could be bad for airlines and passengers if Boeing, which is already in a dominant position globally, forced out Airbus and gave the U.S. manufacturer room to raise prices, she said.\n\"If Airbus is forced out of the market, prices would go up, which is not in the interests of the public.\"\nAsked if Airbus was planning an anti-trust action on the Delta deal, she said: \"If we were asked by any of the official instances (authorities), we will of course be ready to talk to them.\"\nBoeing, which has around 60 percent of the world civil aircraft market, is merging with McDonnell Douglas which has around 10 percent.

The panel extended the deadline on the 782 million pound ($1.3 billion) bid from Dec. 20 until Dec. 24.\nThe panel extended the fiercely fought bid on Friday in what newspaper reports said was a reaction to BZW's initial failure to disclose an extra 250,000 pound ($417,000) fee related to its performance in the bid.\nAs the initial deadline expired, CE had obtained control of only 49.77 percent of Northern. But after the deadline was extended until Christmas Eve, CE notched that total up to 50.13 percent, a majority that would have given it victory.\nBut acceptances after the initial deadline require consent from the Takeover Panel. Northern is now fighting to appeal the extension to try to make the late acceptances null and void and to retain its independence.\n\"If the panel rejects the right to appeal, or the appeal fails, then Northern will be taken over. If the appeal committee says the panel was wrong to extend the bid, then Northern stays independent,\" said one analyst who declined to be identified.\nAt Northern's request, dealing in its shares was temporarily suspended from Monday morning, standing at 638 pence, pending the conclusion of the appeal process.\nCE, which is 70 percent owned by Omaha-based CalEnergy, then complained to the panel last week about share purchases made by BZW and Schroders. The panel said there was nothing wrong with those share purchases but did rule out further buying by BZW and Schroders when it extended the deadline.\nA BZW official told Reuters that the fee from Northern was not in any way linked to BZW buying of Northern shares.\nNorthern had fought hard to fend off CE Electric's 650 pence per share bid, which it claimed undervalued the company, promising a 17 percent rise in its final dividend and lower than expected debt.\nCE Electric, which raised its original 630 pence offer on Dec. 6, maintained that it was offering a fair price and has already bought nearly 30 percent of Northern on the market. It has said it will hang on to that stake even if its bid fails, which analysts said could depress Northern's shares.\nThe bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds ($933 million) fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year.\n", "Citibank NA on Monday started the move by foreign banks across the river to Shanghai's Pudong development zone, hoping to gain an early start in the local Chinese currency business.\nBut a senior Citibank executive at the formal opening of the Citibank branch office in Pudong said he saw only modest profit opportunities in the early stages of local currency operations.\nJohn Beeman, Citibank's Country Corporate Officer for China told a news conference marking the branch opening that he expected the Chinese central bank to issue detailed regulations covering foreign banks doing Chinese yuan business in March.\n\"There will then be a thorough inspection of our branch premises and procedures. Assuming we pass the inspection, we hope to be able to offer (local currency) products and services in April,\" he said.\nCitibank is one of eight foreign banks which have so far been given approval to do Chinese yuan business. Up to now, all foreign banks in China have been restricted to foreign currency transactions only.  \nOne of the main conditions attached to the right to do local business is that the chosen foreign banks must move their main operations to the Pudong district, which the Shanghai city government wants to develop into a financial centre.\nTransport links to Pudong are currently undeveloped and the office vacancy rate in the main business area is estimated by real estate analysts at more than 70 percent.\nBeeman said he did not expect much volume in local currency loans and deposits in the initial stages of Citibank's operations.\n\"On the scale (of the local currency business), our expectation at least for this year is that it will probably be relatively modest,\" Beeman said.\n\"On profitability, it depends how you do the accounting. But I would expect it to be profitable in terms of operating income almost from the beginning,\" he added.\nPreliminary regulations issued by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, require the volume of Chinese yuan business be no more than 35 percent of the volume of a bank's foreign exchange business.  \nThey are also restricted to taking deposits and making loans to foreign-invested enterprises registered in Shanghai, and to Chinese firms that have obtained special approval.\nCitibank is the only U.S.-based bank among the eight foreign banks so far granted permission to do Chinese yuan business.\nForeign bankers estimate that probably seven or eight other foreign banks with branches in Shanghai meet the financial and operational pre-conditions for applying to do local business.\nBut the requirement to move to Pudong presents significant problems for some banks in terms of dealing with their current office space, one European banker said.\n\"They have made it very clear that it is Pudong or nothing,\" the banker said. \"There is no flexibility at all. They have to move, which for some may not be easy.\"\nBut Citibank's Beeman said he saw the Chinese banking authorities gradually relaxing restrictions and expanding the scope for foreign banks to do local currency business once they were satisfied with the way things were working.\n\"In China, it starts with a small group on an experimental basis until the authorities are satisfied things are running smoothly, then they expand it quite rapidly,\" Beeman said.\n", "Apple Computer Inc. stock rose Thursday on renewed speculation that the troubled computer maker was trying to sell itself to a bigger company.\nThe stock of the Cupertino, Calif., company gained 87.5 cents to $18.875 on trading of 4.9 million shares, making it one of the most active issues on the Nasdaq.

Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy also declined to comment about the rumours, \"no matter how accurate or silly they may be.\"\nMulling takeover bids is nothing new at Apple. In addition to Sun, Apple negotiated with International Business Machines Corp. about a merger two years ago. IBM also demurred over price.\nFormer high-level Apple executives who keep close contact with the company said Thursday they have not heard of any recent moves by Apple to approach suitors.\nOne former executive said, however, that increasing pressure from investors -- who hold stock near a 10-year low -- may make Chairman Gilbert Amelio more receptive to any takeover proposal that might come along.\nTrouble is, none might come along, analysts said.\n\"It's always possible, but we're not putting a lot of weight into it,\" said Peter Andrews, analyst at brokerage AG Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.\nEven though Apple still has a huge following of Macintosh users, the company will not be able to stop its sales from falling for at least another year, making it an unattractive buyout, analysts said.\nIn the past five quarters, Apple has reported financial losses of close to $1 billion and has had two rounds of job cuts totalling 5,400. Despite the massive expense reductions, the company does not expect to report a profit until the September quarter.\nCompany executives have told investors they expect revenue for the year to fall about 20 percent to $8 billion.\nThe most likely suitor for now is Ellison, the flamboyant head of Oracle who has publicly criticised Amelio for failing to turn the company around.\nEllison set up a World Wide Web site last week to solicit e-mail from investors to gauge support (http://www.us.oracle.com/corporate/press/html/apple.html). Depending on the response, he would launch a bid.\nA spokesman for Ellison said it was too early for him to comment on the results. Ellison could not be reached immediately for comment.\nSome investors said they were not impressed by Ellison's offer.\nRichard Ash, a private investor who owns 3,000 Apple shares, said he would not sell his stock to Ellison because he was not offering a premium over the current stock price.\n", "New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco said Friday that he planned to sue America Online Inc. if the company's negotiations with prosecutors from 20 states over consumer issues broke down.\nVacco told a news conference he would sue the world's largest online service, with more than 8 million subscribers, to halt allegedly deceptive business practices and to win refunds for the company's frustrated customers.\nBut America Online Chairman Steve Case said in an interview with the CNBC cable television channel that he was not considering subscriber refunds. He said the company was doing all it could to alleviate problems and said he understood customers' frustration.\nVacco and other attorneys general or their aides from 20 states met with America Online Thursday in Chicago, either in person or via conference call, to discuss a barrage of complaints by subscribers who have experienced difficulty accessing the service from their computers.\nVacco said he sent notification Thursday of New York state's proposed litigation to America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va. He said a lawsuit would allege the company engaged in deceptive sales practices, false advertising and fraud in selling online services.\nCompany officials did not immediately comment on a possible New York lawsuit.\nAmerica Online stock dipped $1 to $36.25 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe online service, which enables subscribers to send electronic mail, browse the World Wide Web and view proprietary content, has seen an upsurge in the number of subscribers -- and busy signals -- since it switched to a flat-rate, unlimited use pricing plan Dec. 1.\nPreviously, AOL had billed subscribers according to how long they were online.\nAOL moved to placate angry customers last week, telling them it would spend $350 million to upgrade its network. It also asked them to try to cut their use during peak hours.\nVacco said, \"We want to give the consumers a choice that gives them a refund if they want it. Don't just say 'Hang on;' give them a choice, which includes getting out with their money.\"\nBut Case, asked on CNBC about customer refunds, said, \"It's not something we are considering.\"\nAOL already has been hit with at least four class-action lawsuits by subscribers.\nVacco would not comment on Thursday's meeting.\nCase also was reluctant to talk about the meeting.\n\"I'm not going to discuss what is on the table with the attorneys general,\" he said. He said the meeting was \"constructive\" and that the attorneys general asked AOL not to talk about it.\n\"Our interests are really in paraellel,\" Case told CNBC.\n\"Most customers have seen a tremendous price cut (with the change in pricing), they have doubled their usage,\" he said.\nCase said he understood the frustration users feel when they cannot log onto AOL, saying he, too, experiences the same problem when he tries to log on from home in the evening.\n\"The reason we went to unlimited pricing is because our customers asked for it,\" he said. \"Once they are online, they don't have to worry about the clock ticking.

They have to go slow,\" said a Paris-based food sector analyst.\nThe company's Generale Sucriere unit bought the 15 percent stake from Banco Santander. Spanish newspapers said the deal was for 17.14 billion pesetas ($129.4 million).\nA Saint Louis spokesman declined to comment on the price but said Ebro had a market value of 110 billion pesetas, annual sales of 154 billion pesetas and a market share of 54 percent.\nSaint Louis already has a stake of about 21 percent in Sociedad General de Azucarera de Espana (Azucarera), Spain's second-largest sugar group.\nThe two Spanish groups said in December they were working on a merger which would create the European Union's fifth largest sugar group. Ebro bought a 21.8 percent stake in Azucarera from bank Banco Central Hispano (BCH) in November.\nSaint Louis chairman Daniel Melin has said he wants to have a stake of 20 to 25 percent in the merged group, which would produce 80 percent of Spain's European Union sugar quota.\n\"We would now have a 17 percent stake in a merged group which is in line with our policy. We do not want to rise above 25 percent because we would have to make a bid for the rest. We want to be a shareholder, not an operator,\" Saint Louis spokesman Olivier Labesse said.\nSpain's Ministry of Agriculture has in the past blocked attempts by the French group to increase its stake in Azucarera as part of a general policy of stopping foreign companies taking control of the Spanish sugar market.\n\"I believe Saint Louis will try to get a majority and restructure the new company where there is a lot of scope for cost savings. The Spanish ministry may be against it and they can huff and puff but I do not really see how they can block it,\" a London-based analyst said.\n\"There will be a lot of political opposition to a majority stake,\" said Dominique Bastien of brokerage Pinatton Wargny.\nBCH has sold another 24 percent in Ebro to a savings bank, Caja de Salamanca. The Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) is Ebro's largest shareholder with a 35 percent stake, while state-owned food group Mercase is expected to increase its 4.7 percent holding by buying BCH's remaining 4.1 percent stake.\nDresdner Kleinwort Benson financial analyst Charles Manso welcomed the Ebro deal and said he was reviewing his Saint Louis recommendation and might raise it from \"hold\".\n\"This is the second bit of good news in two days.

The question is whether the private sector will follow,\" Gomez said.\nMinister Dlouhy said the deposits would apply to some 30 percent of imports, including selected foodstuffs, cars, electronics, textile products, furniture, and appliances.\nVladimir Kreidl of investment bank Patria Finance said the wage growth limits were \"very drastic and ambitious\" and said staff were likely to be laid off in order to meet the target.\n\"If well implemented, the measures should benefit the economy...The trade deficit should be reduced by 30-50 billion crowns from the originally expected 200-220 billion (1997 deficit),\" Kreidl said.\nThe trade gap rose to 160.3 billion crowns last year from under 100 billion in 1995, and official estimates before imposition of the import deposits were projecting this year's deficit to range around 210 bilion.\nBut Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka said the import deposits would have virtually no impact on the trade balance.\n\"I am leaving my prediction (of the foreign trade deficit) unchanged at 180 billion,\" he said, addding that a major change could come only through a change of the exchange rate policy.\nAnalysts said the programme would have minimal impact on inflation, which fell to 6.8 percent year on year in March.\n\"The effect in the cost of imported goods would be a year-on-year increase in inflation of about 0.3-0.4 percent,\" said Jack Schrantz, head of research at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment in Prague.\n\"But this will be offset by other factors such as decreased government spending and a slowdown in the economy,\" he added.\nOther measures taken by the cabinet include 25.5 billion in budget cuts, setting up an independent capital market oversight body, promoting exports, and fighting more intensively against economic crime.\nThe package also calls for speeding up privatisation of state-held companies, relaxation of monetary policy, and separation of banks' investment and commercial arms.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003\n", "Long-troubled solid waste company Mid-American Waste Systems Inc filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday and said it signed an agreement to sell most assets to fast-growing rival USA Waste Services Inc.\nThe Ohio-based firm had suffered a string of financial losses stemming from a huge appetite for acquisitions and development projects, said people familiar with the company.\n\"They were highly leveraged and got into a situation where they were losing money,\" said Melville Cody of Williams MacKay Jordan &amp; Co Inc.  \nIn a statement, Mid-American said it would sell nearly all its assets to Houston-based USA Waste Services for $180 million in cash and stock. The transaction is subject to bankruptcy court approval.\nMid-American chief executive Gene Meredith was meeting with staff on Wednesday and was unavailable for comment.\nThe company was been trying desperately to cut costs, but was unable to stem the flow of losses, analysts said. It sold its Atlanta assets nearly a year ago to Republic Industries Inc, the diversified Florida company led by billionaire Wayne Huizenga.  \nThe sale of Mid-American's assets comes amid intense consolidation in the highly-fragmented solid waste industry.\nFor USA Waste, the transaction with Mid-American marks the latest in a string of acquisitions that has taken the company from annual revenue of about $4 million in 1990 to an estimated $2 billion in 1997.\n\"I think USA Waste has clearly shown they can maintain the momentum of consolidation at this juncture,\" said Michael Hoffman of CS First Boston, who rates the stock a buy and raised 1997 earnings estimates to $1.70 per share from $1.65 and increased 1998 estimates to $2.15 per share from $2.05.  \nUSA Waste anticipates the Mid-American acquisition will add $115 million in annualized revenues, according to analysts who participated in a telephone conference call with the firm.\nUSA Waste did not return a phone call and analysts said executives were involved with a sales and marketing pitch for an upcoming offering of 10 million common shares.\nAnalysts also said that USA Waste has targeted $400 million in acquisitions this year, excluding the Mid-American asset purchase and last week's announced $518 million acquisition of the Canadian assets of Allied Waste Industries Inc.  \nAnalysts also anticipate cost savings from some overlap of the Mid-American assets.\n\"They have been so effective in integrating large acquisitions,\" Cody said about USA Waste.\nIn September, USA Waste bought Sanifill Inc in a $1.6 billion stock transaction that solidified its position as the nation's third-largest waste management company.

The company is currently in default and negotiating with its lenders to try to obtain short-term financing to stabilize the company.\nOn Thursday, Dallas-based Jayhawk Acceptance Corp, another sub-prime lender, said it might have to file for reorganization under protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.  \nSub-prime lenders use commercial debt, with maturities of 270 days or less, to fund purchases of loans from auto dealers. They make money on the spread, or difference, between what they pay for funds and the higher rates of the loans.\nReliance's bank debt can cost about 200 basis points more than commercial debt, lowering the amount they make on the spread, the company said\nBut Reliance also stressed that its bank credit exceeds its commercial debt lines, and that the company has full access to its bank financing.\n\"Our bank group is terrific,\" said Jim Kaplan, general counsel for Reliance. \"They have called us and told us they are strongly behind us.\"\nAnalysts said they had also heard that the commercial debt market has been closed to sub-prime lenders this week.\n\"Mercury has been making a lot of people gun-shy,\" said Thomas Kmiotek, analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co.\n((Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787))\n", "The House approved legislation Wednesday to usher in the largest overhaul of the federal public housing programme since its creation in the New Deal era of President Franklin Roosevelt.\nThe bill, approved 293-132, ends many federal rules and is meant to give local housing authorities more power and leeway to run the nation's 13,200 public housing developments.\nOfficials would have more authority to raise and lower rents and select who occupies low-income housing. The legislation would scrap the landmark Housing Act of 1937.\nThe Clinton administration opposes the measure, saying it would throw the very poor out of public housing and replace them with moderate-income residents. Administration officials hope to craft a compromise between the bill and a less-deregulatory version in the Senate closer to their liking.\nSupporters of the House bill say it would help make public-housing residents less reliant on government programmes. And they argue it would encourage tenants to assume a greater role in their community. Unemployed tenants would have to perform community service without pay -- a provision Democrats liken to slavery.\nOpponents also charge the legislation would punish the poor, abandon the government's commitment to the needy, and possibly swell the ranks of the homeless.\n\"The Republicans over the next 10 years will throw 80 percent of the very poor out of public housing,\" said Massachusetts Democrat Representative Joseph Kennedy.\nBut New York Republican Representative Rick Lazio, argued: \"The House has taken a bold and decisive step to reverse the failed federal housing policies of the last 60 years. We are transforming public housing from a way of life into a way to a better life.\"\nThe House and Senate passed separate bills in 1996 but failed to iron out a compromise before Congress adjourned.\nThe new bill covers the nearly seven million people living in public housing or receiving rental aid. Today, the federal government contracts with the nation's 3,400 public housing authorities, which own and operate the housing developments.\nIn exchange for federal dollars, housing authorities run the programmes under close scrutiny from the federal government.\nThe House bill would:\n-- Combine about a dozen spending programmes into two block grants to be administered by local public-housing authorities.\n-- Mandate that 35 percent of public housing residents be among the very poor with incomes of no more than 30 percent of a community's median income. Current law has a 75 percent ceiling on the number of extremely poor residents.\n-- Require able-bodied, unemployed persons who live in public housing or who receive rental assistance to perform eight hours a month of community service or get job training.\n-- Allow tenants to pay either a flat rent or an amount up to 30 percent of their income. Supporters argue the existing system, which links a tenant's rent to income, creates a disincentive to work because rent increases with income.\n-- Make it easier to evict drug dealers and criminals from public housing, and demolish and replace decrepit housing.\n-- Require speedy improvement of troubled public housing authorities or the ouster of their management.\n-- Let local governments enter pacts with HUD to receive public housing money and rental assistance funds directly from the federal government. Local officials would have to adhere to certain standards, but would get more flexibility to spend the money in ways tailored to their individual needs.\nThe legislation would authorise spending of $6.1 billion for the 1998 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, and a total of $29.5 billion through 2002.\n", "London telecoms analysts are split about the prospects of Britain's Cable and Wireless Communications, the telephone and television cable company that made its market debut on Monday.\nCWC started trading, as expected, at around 300 pence per share and rose to 309 pence before edging back to 299.5, valuing the group at around 4.46 billion pounds.\nCWC, which was formed last year when the Mercury subsidiary of Cable and Wireless Plc merged with the three cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada, floated a 14.7 percent stake in London and New York.\nBrokers Lehman Brothers says a 4.5 billion pound implies an enterprise value of about 6.0 billion pounds, assuming pro forma net debt at the end of 1996 at 1.5 billion stg. The valuation assumes a 700-800 million stg premium to the sum of the parts, assuming a valuation of Mercury of 2.0 billion pounds.\n\"The timing required to accomplish the technical integration of the various parts as well as the investments necessary to establish the new brand on a nation-wide basis suggest that at 4.5 billion stg, CWC assets are fairly valued.\"\nWith 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure, CWC plans to complete its sophisticated broadband cable and local telephone networks and offer its services to six million customers by 2001.\nHowever, other analysts, such as Richard Jones at brokers Yamaichi and Andrew Harrington at Salomon Brothers, were more bullish.\nJones is recommending buying the stock up to 350 pence per share. Harrington values the shares at 438p and the company at 6.5 billion pounds.\nHarrington argues that CWC's network cost structure has a competitive advantage against its main telephony and multi-channel television provider -- British Telecommunications Plc and satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc.\n\"It's got 50 percent fewer employees per line than BT,\" he said. \"We think CWC has a unique competitive advantage in the provision of multi-channel TV and telephony. I think it's going to exceed expectations in the next year.\"\nCWC's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury. Initially, 91 percent of revenues will come from telephony and only nine percent from entertainment, but it will be the first company to be able to bundle multi-channel television and telephony.\nNevertheless, some analysts are cautious about the new company's prospects. Cable television companies have yet to make a profit in Britain's stagnant market.\n\"On a longer-term view, any valuation becomes almost entirely dependent on your view of what the longer-term penetration rate is going to be for telephony and cable TV,\" noted one analyst, who declined to be named.\nHe said BT would move into broadcasting by 2001 at the latest, when current regulatory restrictions are lifted, and the group was likely to move into interactive services such as home shopping and home banking sooner.\n\"Put that alongside the impact of BT's on-going marketing muscle in basic telephony, combined with the impact of digital terrestrial TV and digital satellite TV, and I think that will all serve to put a brake on our expectations of long-term cable TV penetration,\" he said.\nOliver Ehrenberg, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, says CWC is not worth more than 3.75 billion pounds -- and says his valuation is already stretched.\nBut Harrington brushed aside these concerns, noting that BT's network will need a lot of investment to upgrade its telephone lines so they can support multi-channel TV and interactive services.\n\"Everything BT can do Cable and Wireless Communications can to better and sooner,\" he said.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542\n", "China named on Thursday four more foreign banks approved to handle local currency business, and bankers said they saw the accelerated timetable reflecting a desire to boost property prices in Shanghai's Pudong zone.\nThe China Daily said the four new banks were U.K.-based Standard Chartered Bank, Japan's Sanwa Bank and Daiichi Kangyo Bank and the Shanghai-Paris International Bank, a joint venture between France's Banque National de Paris and the Industrial and Commerical Bank of China.\nThe newspaper said the banks, and four others named earlier, would be able to take deposits and make loans in yuan, the Chinese currency, only after they had moved operations to the Pudong district of Shanghai.\n\"I see the whole thing as being real-estate driven,\" said a foreign banker. \"To make Pudong a success, they need to get the foreigners over there, so there's no reason limiting the numbers.\"\nThe Chinese authorities want to make the Pudong development zone in eastern Shanghai the country's premier financial district, and have told foreign banks they will only be allowed to do local currency business from offices there.\n\"Before the banks were approved no one would touch Pudong, but now people are charging over there to try and sign something up,\" said a real estate broker.\nForeign bankers had originally assumed the authorities would wait until the first four banks had begun operations before approving any more.\nThe first four are Citicorp's Citibank unit, HSBC Corp's Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp unit, the Industrial Bank of Japan and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd\nChinese banking sources said a number of other banks would also be approved for yuan business during 1997.\nForeign bankers said the faster they were allowed into the yuan business the better, regardless of the limitations placed upon them.\nApproved banks can only accept Chinese yuan deposits from foreign-funded firms or from foreign individuals, or deposits from Chinese enterprises derived from the banks' loans to them.\nThe banks can supply yuan loans only to foreign-funded firms or Chinese enterprises who have previously obtained foreign currency loans from the banks.\n\"We won't be able to increase our customer base, but it's at least a start, another step forward,\" said a foreign banker.\n\"It's a very significant step,\" said a senior banker with one of the chosen banks. \"If a bank can't do business in the local currency then it's only half a bank.\"\n\"We welcome this good news,\" said Lance Browne, Standard Chartered's chief executive for China. \"It's a positive development for our business in China.\"\nAnother banker said specific regulations for the business had not yet been issued by the central bank, and training sessions for foreign bank staff were in progress nearly every weekend.\nOne banker said he did not

fall in annual net profit on Friday, with abnormal losses possibly sinking the bottom line into red ink, stock analysts said on Thursday.\nPacDun, dogged by litigation over problems with its U.S.-made cardiac implants and by weak economic growth at home and abroad, has already softened the blow by warning investors last May that annual profit would be 35 percent lower.  \nThe warning pared forecasts of pre-abnormal net profit down to an average of A$162 million for the year to June 30, said BZW Investment Management's BARCEPS forecasting service.\nThis compares with a 1994/95 pre-abnormal result of A$251 million and a first-half pre-abnormal result of A$118 million.\nBut the group -- a major international producer of rubber consumer goods, car batteries and tyres, industrial cables and clothing -- is likely to book a large net abnormal loss of up to A$300 million, Macquarie Equities analyst Greg Dring said.  \nPacific Dunlop's troubled U.S. medical equipment unit, Telectronics, which accounted for A$60.5 million in abnormal losses in 1994/1995, will again incur big provisions for costs associated with its pacemaker leads, he said.\nDring estimated that these provisions could account in 1995/96 for about A$200 million of a total net abnormal loss estimated at up to A$300 million, he added. He said he assumed the group would not book a tax benefit on these losses.\n", "John Major's Conservatives can no longer rely on the loyal support of much of Britain's press to help deliver the votes needed to secure a fifth successive election victory, editors and political analysts say.\n\"It's the Sun wot won it,\" Rupert Murdoch's top-selling tabloid trumpeted after Major's ruling party defied the opinion polls and secured a slim 21-seat majority in 1992.\nTraditionally pro-Conservative newspapers, some 70 percent of Britain's press, threw their full weight behind Major five years ago, rubbishing opposition leader Neil Kinnock at every turn and warning voters not to trust Labour's promises.\n\"If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights,\" was the Sun's election day message, illustrated with a front-page picture of the Labour leader's head framed in a lightbulb.\nBut media watchers believe that Major is unlikely to enjoy such unequivocal support against Labour's Tony Blair in an election which the prime minister announced on Monday would be held on May 1. Labour has a big lead in opinion polls.\n\"It won't be possible for the Sun to be as enthusiastic about Major and negative about Blair as they were about Major and Kinnock last time around,\" said Ian Hargreaves, former editor of the Independent newspaper.\n\"They have poured so much crap on Major's head that it wouldn't be possible to back him enthusiastically and retain credibility with their readers,\" added Hargreaves, who now edits the left-leaning New Statesman magazine.\nKinnock was portrayed as volatile and untrustworthy by much of the press in the last campaign. Blair is a media-savvy moderate who has taken his party to the centre ground since becoming leader in July 1994 and is a harder target to attack.\nMajor's battle to keep his party together over future relations with the European Union has reduced his standing among the pro-Conservative newspapers, many of which demandi a stronger anti-European line.\n\"It would be inconceivable and a mistake for the Sun not to deliver its vote but it might not be done with the rasping clarity we have come to know and love,\" Hargreaves added.\n\"I would expect the Sun to be pro-Tory but I think the tone may be that of a 'plague on both your houses'. I think that might be something you see in quite a bit of the press.\"\nPOLITICAL BIAS\nBritish newspapers wear their political sympathies on their sleeves, not only writing trenchant editorials but also slanting their news coverage in a way that amazes many foreign readers.\nThe support is important as newspaper circulation remains high in Britain. The combined circulation of the national dailies has been in gradual decline but still tops 14 million each day.\nAmong the mass-market tabloids, the Daily Mirror and its Scottish sister the Daily Record were alone in backing Labour in 1992. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both stuck to their customary pro-Conservative line, as of course did the Sun.\nAmong the broadsheet \"quality\" press, Murdoch's Times and Canadian Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph both backed the government while the Guardian supported Labour and the Independent lived up to its name by remaining broadly neutral.\nMost surprising of all was an election day editorial in favour of Labour from the Financial Times, the daily staple of business people.\nBlair understands the power of the press and provoked controversy in 1995 when he accepted an invitation to address a conference organised by Murdoch's News Corp in Australia, the media magnate's homeland.\nThe Labour leader has dined with several newspaper proprietors and editors who have reacted with warm words to Blair. But Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell still believes he is \"dealing with a press that basically wants to do us in if it can\".\nMURDOCH'S INFLUENCE\nMurdoch's influence over the British press is hard to overstate, his News International arm controlling around 35 percent of the market through its ownership of the Sun, the Times and Sunday titles News of the World and Sunday Times.\n\"Labour are haunted by the Sun 'light-bulb' front page and are determined to avoid a repetition of that,\" said Andrew Jaspan, former editor of Britain's Observer newspaper, commenting on Blair's efforts to build bridges with Murdoch.\nThere has been speculation that some of the News International stable may come out and back Blair.\nCampbell says the Sun and the Daily Mail, often called the voice of Middle England, are the most important papers for his party but he is cautious about the chances of their endorsement. \"I don't think even the most zealous right-wingers in those papers want to get back to where they were with Neil Kinnock,\" he said.\n\"Having said that, I've always said that if we could actually win the endorsement of a paper whose endorsement we didn't have at the last election, that would be a huge bonus.\" The mid-market Express, known as a \"Conservative party cheer leader\", is one possibility. United News &amp; Media, the paper's parent company, is now controlled by Labour supporting peer Lord Hollick, nicknamed \"The Red Baron\".\nABILITY OF MEDIA TO SWING VOTES IN DOUBT\nDespite the anecdotal evidence and the Sun's claims, there is some doubt about the extent to which newspapers are able to affect voting patterns although opinion polls show readers of the Telegraph, Times and Sun are increasingly turning to Labour.\n\"It does look as if the tabloids are able to swing people and the Sun seems better at doing this than the Mirror,\" said Bill Miller, politics professor at Glasgow University.\n\"Mirror readers are more likely to be politically committed whereas the majority of Sun readers are not political animals and more open to influence,\" he said.\nBut Miller, who has studied the effects of newspapers on voting, said the importance of the press can be overstated.\nHe notes that the Sun, for example, sells only four million copies in a nation of 35 million voters.\n\"There is a net influence -- perhaps a swing of one percent which last time would have made the difference between Major's majority and a hung parliament.\"\nBut he said that this was not enough to affect the 15 to 20 percentage point lead which Labour holds in most opinion polls.\n\"If you want to annoy an incoming government you must expect to bear the consequences. It may be that the classic Tory tabloids realise this is not the election for them,\" he said.\n", "The Czech central bank, for the second time in a week, said on Tuesday that it was prepared to intervene to stop the crown from strengthening further, pushing the crown lower and prompting a sell-off by London traders.\n\"Our starting point is that parity is a base, and this is the right level (for the crown),\" Jiri Pospisil, the head of the Czech National Bank's (CNB) monetary department, told an economic conference.\nAfter the comment, the crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket midpoint at 28.750/dollar 16.873/mark, or 3.68 percent over parity with the basket, but down nearly 100 basis points from the CNB's daily fixing at +4.65 percent.\n\"There is a debate going on at the central bank over the nature of the appreciation of the exchange rate, and on the most suitable way to react to it,\" Pospisil, who is also on the CNB board, said.\n\"The debate has not been finished but our possibilities are clear: either we can react through interest rates or through direct intervention on the market,\" he added.\nOne of post-Communist Europe's most stable currencies, the crown consistently reached record highs in late January and early February, fuelled by demand brought about by a wave of more than 30 billion crowns in Eurobond issues since the start of the year.\nThe crown's surge has also been boosted by investors taking advantage of interest rate spreads against major currencies and an inverted yield curve.\nDealers said Pospisil's comments had shaken the market, especially some foreign investors, and could force the crown down further before it finds support.\n\"This has really shaken the market badly,\" said one London analyst. \"I think a sell-off could push it down to as low as three percent above parity before finding some support.\"\nIt was the second time in the past week that central bank comments have pushed the crown sharply lower.\nLast Wednesday the central bank said it had the option of intervening on the market when necessary, prompting London dealers to bail out over the next two days and pushing the crown down some 200 basis points against parity.\nDespite Pospisil's words, dealers said that it did not appear that any intervention was imminent as it could not lower rates due to concerns over controlling the money supply and inflation.\n\"I think the central bank is trying to make the crown more volatile by its comments, but I'm not sure if it is ready to do anything real such as intervene,\" said Breta Tichanek of ING Bank. \"They are just trying to push the crown back to parity by letting the market do it in its own way,\" he added.\nThe CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent.\nThe CNB's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent, while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June.

We only know initially that there were maybe more than 1,500 houses,\" the Jiashi official said. \"Houses that are a bit shoddy might be done for now and are not fit to live in,\" she said.\nAuthorities in Jiashi had started relief activities and aid teams from other parts of Xinjiang were preparing to move in to help, the official in Urumqi said.\n\"Relief activities are just getting under way,\" he said.\nGovernment officials in Jiashi could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe tremor was one of several aftershocks from an earthquake of 6.4 magnitude that caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in Jiashi on January 21, the Jiashi seismological official said.\n\"This one was much smaller than the last earthquake,\" she said, adding that an aftershock of 5.0 that jostled Jiashi last week had barely been felt.\nThat aftershock was from a tremor measuring 5.3 earlier in February, she said. No casualties were reported in either of the smaller quakes.\nThe January earthquake caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in the area and the district has since been rocked by hundreds of aftershocks. More aftershocks were expected, officials said.\n", "The United States wants Asia-Pacific countries to expand free trade in information technology, telecommunications and financial services so that the region can influence the World Trade Organization agenda, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said on Saturday.\n\"APEC has decided that it should play the catalytic role in sector opening,\" Barshefsky told reporters on the final day of a three-day meeting of trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.\n\"This is terribly significant,\" she said. \"APEC ought to be leading the way.\"\nBarshefsky said APEC will take the lead in expanding last year's agreement to liberalize information technologies markets and a recent deal to open up trade in telecommunications. If they succeed, APEC countries should give the impetus for a worldwide agreement to liberalize financial services markets.\n\"APEC countries will give a very strong push,\" she said.\nIf enough APEC members voluntarily agree to liberalize trade in these sectors, the organization can push the World Trade Organization to make the APEC deal binding on the larger trade body, Barshefsky said. Agreement is easier to reach within APEC than the WTO since the group is smaller and the agreements are not binding, she added.\nBut progress on financial services depends largely on Latin American and Asian countries significantly beefing up their offers, Barshefsky said.\n\"The United States will put forward an MFN (most favored nation)-consistent offer, but it will be conditional on achieving a critical mass in the Asian countries and Latin America,\" she said.\nAmong the 18 APEC members, some of them will have progressive offers in time for the WTO deadline of mid-July, Barshefsky said.\n\"There are others who have shown reluctance. The same with Latin America,\" she said.\n\"These offers are going to have to be good, or the United States will seek an MFN exemption,\" she challenged.\nSuch an exemption would likely stall progress on the talks. Last month, the United States said a financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice. It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial service providers, the United States said.\nThe world's major trading powers have agreed to put forward requests on financial services commerce by mid-June and offers by July 14 in the hopes of finalizing a deal by the end of December.\nBarshefsky said APEC, which concentrates on developing voluntary initiatives on free trade, should focus on forming sectoral free-trade pacts for areas that are important enough to force the rest of the world to join in.\nShe said she wants to have more than one sector to announce by the APEC summit in Vancouver in November.\nOther APEC countries have suggested singling out trade in environmental services, medical products, oil seeds, wood, paper, chemicals and autos.\nAPEC includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.\n", "France Telecom said on Monday it had taken full control of Keystone Communications, a major U.S. television uplink company, to strengthen its position in the North American television market.\nMichel Combes, director general of France Telecom's audiovisual transmisson activities, said the acquisition for less than $100 million gave the company a prestigious client list of the U.S. majors as well as an enhanced position in Asia.\n\"The acquisition boosts our position on the North American market where our main rival is VIVX Global Access,\" Combes said by telephone from Cannes where he is attending the MIDEM audiovisual market fair.\nFrance Telecom, through its Telediffusion De France (TDF) unit, is already leader in the European market with a 20 percent stake, ahead of British Telecommunications Plc and has an estimated 15 percent in the world market. Keystone has a 20 percent share of the North American market.\nThe market for audiovisual transmission -- the service of carrying television pictures from an event or studio to the broadcasting centre -- is estimated at eight billion francs ($1.5 billion) and seen growing by eight percent per year.\nThe market of broadcasting pictures to the homes, both direct to home as well as to cable company receivers, is also seen at some eight billion francs.\nTotal sales of the unit are two billion francs.\nThis market stands to grow rapidly with the take-off of digital satellite television companies.\nFrance Telecom is partner and service provider to the Television Par Satellite (TPS) digital satellite television venture with TF1, France Television, Lyonnaise des Eaux and Luxembourg's Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Television (CLT).\nCombes said that while the world market was seen growing by eight percent, this growth was less pronounced in Europe while Asia would increase at a quicker pace.\nTDF has a pact with Japan's KDD as well as NHK and is service provider to Hong Kong's television company.\nHe said France Telecom wanted \"to have a foothold in Asia\" which he called an \"interesting market with good growth potential\" but he declined to comment on whether to company would make an acquisition soon in the area.\n\"It is increasingly important that you can provide services for your television clients from whatever place in the world, be it for news or sport,\" Combes said.\nFrance Telecom already had a 40 percent stake in Keystone and bought the remainder from Simmons Group.

year, taking a break from its sharp rise over recent months, traders said on Wednesday.\nThe yuan will move in a tight range between 8.2800 and 8.3500 to the dollar with Beijing determined to cap its rise despite steady upward pressure, they said.\nThe yuan closed at a 20-month high of 8.2935 to the dollar on Wednesday on the Shanghai-based national foreign exchange interbank market, largely on the back of China's record high foreign exchange reserves of $105 billion at the end of 1996.\n\"We expect little movement in the yuan against the dollar in the first six months of this year,\" said a foreign exchange trader with a major Chinese bank.\n\"The economy is good with foreign exchange reserves hitting record highs, but this is being balanced by the higher cost of exports,\" he added. \"The central bank will not allow the yuan to fluctuate sharply under these conditions.\"\nThe yuan has risen slowly but inexorably over the past year from around 8.3174 at the beginning of 1996 -- a rise of just 0.29 percent, making it one of the most stable currencies in the world against the dollar.\nThe rise reflects the overall improvement of the Chinese economy, but has added a slight extra burden to exporters.\nWith the currency's continued strength, the central People's Bank of China has been intervening on almost a daily basis in the market to check the yuan's upward trend, traders said.\nOne Shanghai foreign trade official said the average export cost of foreign exchange stood at 8.38 yuan for each dollar of exported goods in 1996, making exporters lose money when they turned trade surplus dollars into local currency.\nThe central bank has also bought much local currency on the interbank market in the past few months, partly to prevent over-supply of the yuan from fanning inflation, analysts said.\nOverall, the central bank is buying in both dollars and yuan to dampen the market, they added.\nChina's retail price inflation fell to a year-on-year 6.1 percent in 1995 from 14.8 percent year-on-year in 1995.\nBut fixed-asset investment surged again in the second half of last year after Beijing cut bank interest rates in May and August, threatening to rekindle inflation, traders said.\n\"Despite the fall in inflation last year, the central bank is expected to continue to take a cautious approach,\" said a second foreign exchange trader. \"Its intervention on the market to prevent sharp rises and falls of the yuan will continue.\n\"The central government has made it clear it will continue its tight credit policy to prevent a revival of inflation,\" he added.\n", "The newest challenge for Russia, now that it has lumbered over the hurdles of privatisation and market liberalisation, is reforming its giant natural monopolies to underpin long-term economic growth, analysts said on Tuesday.\nBut reforming prices and boosting competition in the gas, electricity and railway monoliths -- as well as tackling the most resilient leftovers of the Soviet planned economy -- could be the toughest economic task yet in this vast country.\nThe monopolies are the government's newest makeover target, castigated for functioning largely as they did in Soviet days, when production costs were irrelevant, competition non-existent and prices bore no relationship to reality.\nPrices for industrial consumers have risen astronomically as Russia's markets take hold, but the new pricing -- domestic customers pay a fraction of real costs -- does not reflect market principles.\nAnalysts said price distortions were hurting the economy, with far-reaching effects ranging from consumers not paying for supplies to shortfalls in budget revenue and commodities houses unable to import grain because of high domestic rail tariffs.\n\"The theoretical principle is very simple,\" said Jochen Wermuth, an economist and adviser at the Finance Ministry. \"If you abolish cross-subsidies and introduce territorially differentiated price structures, you'll see more competition.\"\nBut Russia's monopolies can see only fine-tuning, rather than the major overhaul the International Monetary Fund wants as a condition of its $10 billion, three-year loan to Moscow.\nEach monopoly faces similar problems, but all drag their feet and need prodding from the Kremlin to change old ways.\nGazprom  GAZP.RTS, the natural gas monopoly and the world's largest gas company, needs to release its stranglehold on production and distribution.\n\"To a certain extent Gazprom is pretending to talk about restructuring,\" said Renaissance Capital oil and gas analyst Alexei Kokin. \"It may help it work more efficiently but it won't introduce competition (in gas distribution).\"\nNational electricity firm UES  EESR.RTS, both a producer and a transmitter, must create a wholesale electricity market and allow regional producers to sell directly to end-users.\nBut the tightly-integrated system was set up so that regional generators could send excess supplies to areas needing more, and some analysts said giving the regional \"energos\" a free rein could wreak havoc in the short-term.\n\"If consumers could chose their own providers, they would go for the cheapest supplies, which would lead to no demand at other producers and shortages in certain areas,\" said Marina Oganesian, energy analyst at Troika-Dialog in Moscow.\nAnalysts said the railways monopoly, still a ministry, must stop subsidising passengers with prices many times lower than commercial rates that have influenced the economics of everything from oil exports to grain imports.\nRussia's newest economic whiz kid, First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, wants UES to lower prices and allow competition among producers, but he and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin have ruled out breaking up either UES or Gazprom.\nThe three monopolies, coupled with the oil pipeline export network, account for 40 percent of budget revenues but are a main source of a nonpayments crisis crippling Russian industry.\nJust 10 percent of electricity consumers pay their bills in cash, while UES, Gazprom's biggest domestic client, owes the gas giant billions. UES collects only half of what it is owed.\n\"Clearly, if you keep having a distorted price structure, it's not good for long-term growth,\" Wermuth said, adding he expected major changes this year but that they would be painful.\nThe biggest beneficiaries of monopoly restructuring would be industrial enterprises, whose output contracted an average six percent in 1996, and the monopolies themselves, which would find it easier to collect for supplies delivered.\nThe scale of monopolies whose gas pipelines, powerlines and railroads cover tens of thousands of km (miles) makes restructuring both urgent and difficult. \"It's a big advantage for Russia to be so big -- the hugeness is in fact the argument for efficiency of the energy system,\" Wermuth said.\n", "British supermarket group Safeway said on Friday that sales growth had slowed since early January and inflation was around zero, prompting fears that consumer belt-tightening could hit the sector, analysts said.\n\"What has spooked the sector is the comment that things have slowed since the start of the new year,\" said one trader as supermarket shares dived after the Safeway comments.\nSafeway said in a statement that same store sales were up 5.2 percent in the five weeks to January 4 but over the first 16 weeks of the second half of the financial year, growth slowed to a 4.5 percent rise.\nDeputy chairman David Webster told Reuters that inflation, excluding petrol, was currently running around zero after a modest 0.3 percent rise over the key Christmas period, and the company said lower inflation and slower sales could hit profits.\nSafeway, seen as the most technologically innovative of the supermarkets with electronic scanners and automated checkouts, said its experience was \"in common with the sector\".\nThe company, which has some 7.8 percent of Britain's grocery market, saw its shares slump 25-1/2 pence by 1052 GMT to 363-1/2 pence, making it the third largest loser on the London exchange.\nMarket leader Tesco, which last month said Christmas sales rose 7.5 percent, fell 16-1/2 pence to 347-1/2.\n\"What Safeway is saying is that there is a lack of food price inflation and it does not look as if any is on the way,\" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.\n\"In the last four weeks the sector and Safeway have come off quite sharply in terms of overall sales performance,\" Webster said. It was hard to judge whether the slowdown in sales would continue but he added that the company was still seeing \"significant deflation in produce, which is 10 percent of sales\".\nProfit forecasts for Safeway had been shaved by 10 million pounds ($16.40 million) to 430 million pounds, the trader said, compared with pretax profits of 401 million pounds (corrects from 429.4 million pounds) a year ago.\nThe analyst suggested year profit forecasts for Safeway, Tesco and the two other majors J. Sainsbury and ASDA could be marked down 2-5 percent.\nShares in Sainsbury, which has its own problems -- last week it admitted its profits would be hit by investment in boosting sales as it promotes its loyalty card, dropped seven pence to 321-1/2 pence while ASDA, keeping silent on trading, fell 5-1/2 pence to 115-1/2 pence.\nBut analysts ruled out a price war among the big four despite the squeeze on profits, as companies are expected to focus on improving margins. \"The last thing you want to do if sales are slowing and inflation is flat is to give away margins,\" the analyst said.\nWebster said a price war was very unlikely, adding that if any of the majors launched such an initiative, there would be swift reactions from competitors.\n\"This is not about price, it is about brand quality,\" the analyst said, adding that Safeway's statement was particularly disappointing after its efforts to restructure and refresh its image over the last two or three years.\nSafeway's warning on sales and prices comes hot on the heels of an upbeat report on retailers from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which said high street sales picked up in January and exceeded expectations.\nBut the CBI added that retailers in its survey expected sales to moderate in February.\nBritain's overall inflation rate has slowed to a 2.5 percent rise year-on-year in December, according to latest official figures, while food prices were up a restrained 0.8 percent.

It (corruption) was number one out of a total of seven various aspects...three times in a row. It's been number one there for over a year.\"\nPolitical analysts said the implications of a rise in corruption associated with Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule were enormous.\nFears abound that the Chinese style of doing business, called \"guanxi\" or being connected to the right people, will erode the rule of law, which is considered essential to confidence in Hong Kong and its longer-term competitiveness.\n\"The prosperity of Hong Kong is very much based on upholding the rule of law, its respect for due process. These are very important factors for Hong Kong to function as an international and regional financial centre,\" said Professor Joseph Cheng of the City University of Hong Kong.\nPolitical analysts said that while there was clear evidence of growing Chinese influence in Hong Kong's business, people were less concerned about \"guanxi\" seeping across the border than they were about individual Hong Kong businessmen exploiting the new style of doing business to their advantage.\n\"The business community sees the establishment of relationships in China as very important business assets, and we all know corruption facilitates the establishment of such relationship networks,\" Cheng said.\n\"Businessmen usually say they support fair competition while they make relationship contacts. So we could see this spread of relationship networks and the willingness to use bribery to seal business deals.\"\nDeGolyer said it was essential that Tung started to promote Hong Kong's continued integrity aggressively, with a strong focus on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC).\nThe anti-graft agency has been widely acknowledged as crucial to Hong Kong's reputation as a respectable place to do business.\n\"He should be incessantly beating the drum about the ICAC,\" DeGolyer said. \"He should be hammering away about its independence, its being above board, that he will support it.\"\nThe powerful ICAC was set up in 1974 when corruption was endemic in Hong Kong.\nCheng added that corruption, while not an immediate risk, could be devastating over the longer term.\n\"The whole process is a very gradual one. Corruption spreads gradually, and you don't just say 'There's corruption and I withdraw my investment.' It takes time,\" he said.\n", "Vita Food Products Inc, which sells kosher seafood and other specialty products, is scouting for acqusitions that could help it boost annual sales four-fold within the next five years.\n\"With the right mix of acquisitions, I think we could do $75 million to $100 million (in sales) annually. We've (also) got some things that could really take off internally,\" Stephen Rubin, president, said in an interview. \"I'd like to see it (the sales target reached) before five years.\"\nVita's sales amounted to $21.4 million in 1995.  \nThe company, with products such as salmon and herring sold under the Vita brand, expects to complete at least one acquisition by the end of the year, Rubin said.\nAcquisition targets include companies that sell kosher food or products that could later be certified as kosher. One of the targets is related to seafood, he added.\nRubin added that Vita could also acquire a regional, non-kosher food company and take it national under the existing brand name through Vita's distribution network.\nOver 95 percent of Vita's sales, however, are kosher products.  \nJay Dembsky, Vita's chief financial officer, estimated that the kosher food market overall is growing by 10 to 11 percent annually, whereas the overall food industry grows only in line with the population.\nKosher food, he added, appeals to consumers beyond those adhering to Jewish dietary laws. Kosher food carries \"a perception of higher quality,\" Dembsky said.\nVita also hopes to reap higher sales in 1997 from two new products that were rolled out in the fourth quarter of 1996 -- a line of hummus, a Middle Eastern dish made from chick peas, and frozen salmon burgers.\n\"We expect to see meaningful impact in 1997 from these products,\" Dembsky said.\nVita, which went public earlier this year at $6.00 a share, said it would make secondary offerings in the future if it needed to raise capital for acquisition programs, Rubin said.\nVita shres were up 1/8 at 5-1/8.\n((Reuters Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))\n", "American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Inc. reached a tentative contract with the United Auto Workers minutes before a strike deadline Monday morning, sparing General Motors Corp. a potentially punishing work stoppage.\nDetails of the agreement were withheld pending ratification by about 7,200 UAW members at five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., Buffalo, N.Y., and Tonawanda, N.Y., later this week.\nUAW President Stephen Yokich and Vice President Richard Shoemaker released a statement describing the pact as \"an excellent new agreement.\" Company officials did not return telephone calls.\nThe tentative contract was reached 15 minutes before the 7 a.m. strike deadline. Union and company bargainers negotiated through a midnight Friday deadline and nearly non-stop over the weekend, while UAW members stayed on the job and refrained from putting up picket lines.\nBut by late Sunday evening no agreement had been reached, and UAW officials set the Monday strike deadline to put more pressure on the company.\nAmerican Axle supplies rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear- drive cars, as well as parts for other passenger cars.\nA strike would have forced the world's largest automaker to suspend production at its 11 North American light truck plants within two days, according to analysts, because of tight axle inventories throughout the auto industry. That could have cost GM $20 million a day in profits, analysts said.\nA work stoppage would also have added to Ford Motor Co.'s supplier headaches. American Axle makes axle shafts for Ford's F-150 pickup trucks, Expedition and Explorer sport utility vehicles, as well as some rear-drive cars. The company also makes a small number of parts for Chrysler Corp.\nGM spokesman Gerald Holmes said Monday the automaker did not alter its contract with American Axle to pave the way for a settlement.\n\"We had no part in it at all,\" he said.\nAmerican Axle was spun off from GM in 1994 to a group of investors led by former Chrysler manufacturing chief Richard Dauch. As part of the deal, the components maker agreed to honour the terms of the 1993-96 UAW-GM contract.\nIn the talks that wrapped up Monday -- the first time a GM spin-off had to negotiate a new contract -- UAW officials had been pressing for American Axle to follow the pattern the Big Three agreed to during their contract talks last fall.\nCompany officials were reluctant to do that, however, claiming that would put them at a competitive disadvantage with their competitors.\n", "The head of General Motors Corp.'s  Chevrolet Division said Monday he wants customers to be able to buy a new car or truck in 90 minutes -- down from the six to eight hours it often takes today.\nChevrolet also plans to expand a pilot program called Custom XPress Delivery, whereby buyers of popularly configured Blazers can receive the sport/utility vehicle one day after they sign the papers.\n\"Customers shouldn't have to wait six to eight weeks to take delivery on a new vehicle with the color and options they want,\" said John Middlebrook, general manager of Chevrolet, GM's largest single division.\nThe changes are part of a series of what Chevrolet calls \"Brand Critical Standards\" the division plans to roll out on a national level this year.\n\"Today, building a quality product is just the price of entry,\" Middlebrook said in a speech at the Automotive News World Congress here. \"Dealership experiences set us apart and help make the difference between winning and losing a loyal customer.\"\nMiddlebrook predicted that changes to the distribution system, dealership culture and retail process will be the industry's dominant focus into the 21st century.\nDriving the changes are customer demands for better service and better treatment from the existing new car sales process, one he said has not changed in more than 80 years.\nHe cited the rapid rise of new companies such as Car Max and AutoNation. Often called \"Big Box\" retailers, the new stores offer a wide selection of certified used cars, as well as new cars, at no-haggle prices.\n\"The bottom line is that customers' expectations are changing and will continue to drive change into the retail sales process for automobiles,\" he said.\nAnother area Chevrolet wants dealers to change is the selling process itself. Many sales representatives now spend 20 percent of their time helping a customer settle on a new vehicle, and 80 percent negotiating over the price. Chevrolet wants those numbers reversed.\n\"Our stores have to convey an image that is consistent with the Chevrolet brand. Customers should feel genuine trust when they walk into a Chevrolet dealership,\" he said.\nChevrolet is continuing its plan to reduce the number of dealerships. Eventually, the division wants 4,000 in the United States instead of the current 4,400, said Middlebrook.\nTalking to reporters later, Middlebrook said dealers should have \"good availabitity\" of Chevrolet's new Venture minivan when advertising begins in February or March. However, he warned that overall inventories will be tight.\n\"We're going to be short because I think demand will exceed supply,\" he said, adding that Chevrolet plans to make and sell 70,000 to 75,000 of the new minivans in 1997.\nDespite flat total U.S. minivan sales during the last several months, Middlebrook predicted the segment will grow 25 percent over the next five years as buyers from more demographic groups need the practicality they offer.\n\"As you look at the minivans and their acceptibility, it's across the total age spectrum. We're seeing more and more retirees in a minivan when they retire,\" he said. \"Minivans are going across the entire market spectrum -- much like station wagons used to.\"\nMiddlebrook said segment leader Chrysler Corp. remains the GM's top competitor in the minivan market. In addition to GM, Toyota Motor Corp. will enter the market with a new front-wheel drive product called the Sienna in the fall.\nLast week, Toyota executives said they expect to sell all of the 50,000 to 60,000 Sienna's they can produce in the first model year it is on the market.\n", "The agriculture ministry said on Tuesday it plans to privatise Budejovicky Budvar n.p., makers of Czech Budweiser beer, via a management buyout, after lengthy talks with Anheuser Busch Cos broke down last year.\nThe head of the ministry's privatisation department, Jiri Stehlik, told Reuters that the plan would be to sell a 10 percent stake in Budvar to management with an option for them eventually to buy a further 41 percent.\nThe plan comes after protracted talks broke down last September with Busch over use of the Budweiser trademark and the U.S. company's interest in a minority stake in Budvar, based in the southern Czech city of Budejovice (Budweis).\nThe new plan fits the government's desire to privatise the makers of one of the country's most famous exports but keep the company primarily in Czech hands.\n\"This is the proposal of the (ministry), but the government decides on it, so it can change,\" Stehlik said.\nHe said the plan did not include a foreign partner in the first stage of the privatisation process, but added that it did not exclude later entry of a foreign investor. Stehlik declined to give further details of the plan.\nBudvar, 100 percent state owned, is the maker of the Czech Budweiser, its flagship label. The beer is sold in many markets as Budvar.\nThe Czech government had delayed privatisation of the company while trying to settle a trademark dispute with Anheuser Busch, maker of the U.S. Budweiser, which has been battling with the small Czech cousin for most of the century.\nThe negotiations over the use of the \"Budweiser\" and \"Bud\" trademarks were aimed at resolving the row which prohibits the rivals from selling their labels in the other's key markets.\nBut talks broke down last September when Anheuser-Busch said it would market its brew in much of Europe under the \"Bud\" name.\nAnheuser-Busch sells its beer under the Budweiser name in 11 European countries and under the \"Bud\" name in nine others.\nBudvar is one of the five largest Czech breweries, and Budweiser is one of the country's best-known exports.\n\"Budweiser\" beer has been brewed for centuries in the city known also by the German name Budweis, but the trademark was not registered by the Czechs until late last century,\nThe trademark conflict with Anheuser-Busch, founded by German immigrants to the United States, began in 1911 when the American brewery first insisted that it had registered the brand name before the Czechs.\nThe Czech government considers Budvar as a part of its \"family silver\" of strategic holdings.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "David Walsh, the maverick Canadian embroiled in world's biggest gold fiasco, always dreamed of striking it rich.\nUnder siege since doubts about Busang deposit surfaced in late March, Walsh had dismissed the conspiracy and tampering theories that have dogged his company Bre-X Minerals Ltd. -- until now.\n\"We share the shock and dismay our of shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there,\" Walsh said after his company released a devastating report on Busang on Sunday.\nIn an interim report to Bre-X, consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. said the company's data on Busang was falsified on a scale \"without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world.\"\nIt is a stunning conclusion to a mystery that has gripped the world mining community in recent months.\nWalsh, 51, has made millions of dollars and appeared on the covers of national magazines since his Calgary, Alberta -based exploration company announced its 1993 Busang gold discovery in Indonesia.\n\"I'm nuts. I'm looking for the bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow,\" the beefy stock promoter, who lives in the Bahamas, told a Canadian magazine earlier this year.\nVeteran Calgary journalist Jim Bentein, who covered Bre-X since its early days on the Alberta Stock Exchange, has described Walsh as \"a sophisticated trucker,\" who is as comfortable having a beer and a smoke in a bar as he is in financial circles.\nAfter the Strathcona report, some Bre-X shareholders who stood by the company during the turmoil now blamed Walsh.\n\"He should be prosecuted to full extent of the law,\" Chris Laughren, a  construction worker, told Reuters on Sunday as he waited anxiously outside Bre-X's headquarters in Calgary.\nLaughren said he has lost C$7,500 ($5,400) on Bre-X stock, or \"three months work down the drain.\"\nWalsh said on Sunday he would do all he could to protect Bre-X's assets \"for the benefit of the shareholders.\"\nRaised in a wealthy suburb of Montreal, Walsh followed his father and grandfather into the stock business.\nHe joined a small trust company shortly after graduating from high school. In 1976 he moved to brokerage Midland Doherty Ltd. (now Midland Walwyn Capital Inc.) and rose to vice president in its institutional equity sales department.\nIn the 1980s Midland moved Walsh to Calgary, but he left the company shortly afterward to set up his own company, Bresea Resources Ltd.\nAfter dabbling unsuccessfully in oil and gas, Walsh created Bre-X Minerals Ltd. in 1989 and ventured into mining.

I had never imagined it would be this big,\" he said.\nWalsh, his wife and other company officials added more than C$37 million ($27 million) to their bank accounts after they sold Bre-X stock at prices ranging from C$24.40 ($17.81) to C$28.40 ($20.73) between August and October 1996.\nBut the sales were controversial because they occurred shortly after Bre-X learned its preliminary license had been canceled by the Indonesian government, a development the company did not reveal publicly until October 1996.\nAs the fallout from Sunday's announcement reverberated through the world mining community, Walsh had little to say to reporters as he sped away from Bre-X's Calgary headquarters.\n\"I think our press release says it all for now,\" he said.\n", "Seven Network Ltd chairman Kerry Stokes said on Wednesday that Seven would probably sell pay-tv firm Optus Vision to an international phone company if it was successful in litigation against Optus Vision shareholders.\nSeven claims in its court action that fellow shareholders in Optus Vision had breached the Optus Vision shareholders' agreement. Seven, a two percent shareholder in Optus Vision, has said successful litigation would mean it would be allowed to acquire Optus Vision at a discount to its full valuation.  \n\"We are talking to some international companies, mainly telecommunications and informational technology companies,\" Stokes told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nStokes, who owns about 20 percent of Seven, said Seven would have 12 months in which it would be required to sell Optus Vision, which is spending A$3 billion on a fibre optic cable network around Australia carrying pay TV and telephone services.\nStokes said there was more interest from companies in using the Optus Vision assets for telephone services than for pay TV.\nHe added that none of the firms he had spoken to have any existing interest in Australia's pay television industry.  \nOn Monday, Seven said it had two offers to buy the rest of Optus Vision, one for A$648.74 million and the other for A$533.80 million. It said it had 10 days to consider and respond to the offers.\nAsked if Seven would pay anymore than the A$648.74 million offer, Stokes replied: \"No, we won't have to.\" He said that under the shareholder agreement, the Optus Vision shareholders would be required to sell at those prices.\nAustralia's telecommunications industry is to be fully deregulated on July 1.  \nStokes said there had been a lot of interest in the Optus Vision assets.\n\"You wouldn't be able to build that kind of infrastructure for the prices we will be able to get it at,\" Stokes said.\nOther Optus Vision shareholders involved in the battle with Seven are Optus Communications Pty Ltd and U.S. West unit Continental CableVision, each of which own 46.5 percent, and Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, which has a five percent stake in the pay TV group.\nLigitation between Seven and the other Optus shareholders is to be heard in the New South Wales Supreme Court on February 24.  \nOptus Communications is 25 percent owned by Mayne Nickless Ltd.

(but) the follow-up has been a closer relationship,\" Nelson said, adding that Microsoft and Chinese officials had taken just six days to resolve the issue.\nThe company had lost more in terms of market momentum than in the financial outlay needed to correct the software and issue free updates to previous buyers, he said.\nWhile copyright piracy continued to be a problem in China, with unlicensed use running at up to 95 percent for some applications, Microsoft had seen some improvment in the domestic market, Nelson said.\nThe company had seen no progress from Beijing's clampdown on pirates who exported counterfeit goods, he said.\n", "National Westminster Bank Plc said on Monday it would complete an internal probe into a 50 million pound ($81 million) trading hole as quickly as possible.\n\"Our internal inquiry is continuing...we are trying to do it as quickly as possible,\" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters.\nBut the bank, which on Friday revealed mispricing errors in the interest rate options book at its investment banking arm NatWest Markets, is also employing an outside firm.\n\"We are using internal resources and also external advisors,\" the NatWest official said, although she declined to say which firm had been appointed to help the bank unravel what went wrong.\nThe investigation, which will include a thorough review of NatWest's control systems, is expected to take several weeks.\nBritish financial regulator the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), which licenses options traders, has been informed of the errors. But NatWest would not say whether it had meetings with the watchdog over the weekend.\n\"We are keeping our regulators informed,\" the NatWest spokeswoman said. SFA officials were not immediately available for comment but the Bank of England, which regulates banks generally, on Sunday said it would be looking at what happened.\nOptions are contracts giving buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security at a set price on a set date in the future.\nBanking sources said mispricing was a general term which did not necessarily imply there had been any fraudulent intention but could have resulted from pricing errors.\nBut they added that if such errors occurred on an on-going basis, it would suggest that the trader involved had been aware of a discrepancy between actual and book price of the derivatives in which he was dealing.\nBanking sources named the interest rate options trader at the centre of the affair as Kyriacos Papouis, who now works for U.S. securities firm Bear Stearns, but NatWest would not confirm this.\nPapouis, who left NatWest Markets last year, could not be reached at Bear Stearns in London and the firm said it was referring all calls to the trader to its press office in New York.\nA spokeswoman there was not immediately available for comment.\nBankers questioned why it had taken NatWest several months to uncover the mispricings, which it said had taken place over a period during 1996 but had only come to light in the last few days.\nThe NatWest spokeswoman said this time lapse was one aspect of the affair it would be addressing in its internal probe. She said the inquiry would also aim to uncover the motivation of whoever was responsible for what had occurred.\nIn addition to reporting one trader to the SFA, NatWest said it had suspended a senior trader, named by banking sources as Neil Dodgson, for \"failure to supervise\", pending the conclusion of its probe.\nA spokesman for Dodgson said he could not comment on the case but would co-operate fully with any investigations.\nWhile the banking community awaited further details of precisely what precipitated the 50 million pound loss, NatWest's shares were marked lower, dropping 41 pence to 717.5 pence by early afternoon.\nAround 24 pence of this fall was attributable to the impact of the shares going ex-dividend while the sector as a whole was weaker following the announcement of HSBC Holdings' results.

There isn't any great underlying revenue growth. Costs are likely to be held down and brokerage to remain flat so it's not very exciting basically.\"\nThe strengthening of sterling against the dollar and other currencies had a disproportionate effect on the results due to the weighting of foreign currency revenues in the company's global speciality businesses in the early part of the year.\nAs previously forecast, changes in the pattern of the business were likely to reduce the proportion of annual profit arising in the first quarter, Reeve said.\n\"Against this background, our underlying performance is satisfactory, with encouraging growth in a number of key business segments,\" he said.\nIndustry consolidation had led to significant shifts in the competitive environment and the resulting large combinations created both challenges and opportunities, said Reeve.\nA series of mergers among rivals has left Willis and British rival Sedgwick Group trailing far behind industry giants Aon Corp and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc of the U.S.\nChicago-based Aon has bought out three of its rivals in the past six months and said only last week that it was still interested in doing more deals.\nMarsh &amp; McLennan's $1.8 billion acquisition of privately-owned Johnson &amp; Higgins in March has further increased the pressure on the two British brokers and raised the prospect of the two being pushed into each others arms as the only solution to their current difficulties.\nHowever, Willis has always brushed off suggestions it may be interested in teaming up with its British rival.\nReeve said the company intended to continue to pursue its change programme, designed to alter fundamentally the way it does business and \"seize new development opportunities within the altered market-place.\"\n($ = 0.611 British Pounds)\n", "Top Citicorp managers have testified before a grand jury probing allegations of possible money laundering involving former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's brother, Citicorp Chief Executive Officer John Reed said Wednesday.\nReed, answering a shareholder at the giant banking company's annual meeting, neither identified the executives nor said how many had given secret testimony but emphasised that Citicorp was cooperating fully with the grand jury.\nRaul Salinas, now jailed in Mexico on murder and illicit enrichment charges, was accused in February by a Swiss prosecutor of receiving huge sums of money from major drug cartels. Some $100 million was found in Raul Salinas' Swiss bank accounts.\nBoth Raul Salinas and his brother, the former Mexican president now in self-imposed exile in Ireland, deny any connections to illegal drug operators.\nReed told reporters immediately after the meeting that he himself had not been summoned by the grand jury, a panel of citizens which reviews police evidence for the possible filing of criminal charges.\nA Citicorp spokesman declined to say how many executives had testified before the grand jury, believed to be meeting in New York.

Its enterprise server software, used on the server computers that run networks, will cost $1,295, up from $995.\nUnder the new pricing, Netscape will charge an average 10 percent to 15 percent more for service, it said.\nBut, by delaying the price increases until April 1, Netscape has made a pre-release version of Communicator a more attractive buy and positioned itself for higher sales this quarter, executives said.\nPeople who pay now for the software, which is available in a preview version, will be able to get the final version for free when it becomes available in the next quarter.\nMichael Homer, Netscape's vice president of marketing, said the new prices still offer a better deal than rival products from Microsoft Corp. and the Lotus Development Corp. unit of International Business Machines Corp..\nLotus President Jeff Papows quickly challenged that and accused Netscape executives of \"childish behavior\" in making pricing comparisons that Papows said were misleading.\n\"There's very little difference in the price points, actually,\" Papows said after making a presentation to a Goldman Sachs conference at which Netscape's vice president of engineering, Eric Hahn, disclosed the price increases.\n\"Our servers are much cheaper to acquire,\" he said, noting that Lotus Domino server software is priced at $2,995 compared with Netscape's SuiteSpot 3.0, which allows customers to chose five of its nine server products for $3,995, or $4,995 after April 1.\nA Microsoft executive also disputed Netscape's pricing claim.\n\"Our browser and our server are still free, so we've got to be less expensive,\" said Mike Nash, a marketing director in the company's personal and business systems group.\nMicrosoft's Internet Explorer browser is free for all platforms, and its Internet Information Service is included as a feature of the Windows NT Server operating systems for large networks.\nThe three companies are competing fiercely in the fast-growing market for electronic mail, scheduling and so-called workgroup software for intranets, the corporate networks that make use of cost-effective Internet technologies.\nNetscape stock rose 87.5 cents to $35.625, and Microsoft climbed $1.375 to $99.875, both on the Nasdaq market.

His 1997 forecast was unchanged at C$1.40 ($1.03) a share since the deals do not close until late June and more Philips shares will be issued, offsetting earnings growth.\nPhilip earned C71 cents (52 cents) a share in 1996.\nShares of Philip were down C50 cents to C$22 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday and by 25 cents to $16.125 in New York.\nAllWaste rose $2.50 to $9.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Serv-Tech rose 81.25 cents to $5.875 on Nasdaq.\n", "Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) managing director David Murray, buoyant after a surprisingly strong profit result, said on Thursday that CBA had decided to expand its presence in Asia and New Zealand.\nMurray also said CBA had submitted a first-round non-binding bid to buy Axiom Funds Mangement, which manages A$17 billion of funds and is being sold by the New South Wales state government.  \n\"We've already expanded our presence in Asia and we're about to start our joint venture bank in Indonesia, but I think there's more up there for us to do and we've decided to seek out some fresh opportunities,\" Murray told reporters after addressing a Securities Institute function.\n\"Our focus has been Indonesia, China, Vietnam and India because they are countries whose financial systems are still evolving because the Australian system, which is one we know very well, is quite mature,\" he said.  \n\"We're looking in each of those countries for joint venture opportunities,\" he said, adding such joint venture arrangements would not require significant capital injections from CBA.\nCBA announced an 11 percent rise in net profit for the six months to December 31 to A$602 million and increased its interim dividend by seven cents to 45 cents per share.\nThe result was well above expectations and fired a four percent rally in CBA's share price to A$13.90. The stock closed up two cents at A$13.93 on Thursday as the overall market rallied another one percent to an all-time high.  \nMurray said CBA was looking to diversify and expand in New Zealand as well as Asia, and was examining acquisition opportunities and the potential for organic growth of its ASB Bank unit there.\nHe said CBA had been successful in New Zealand with ASB Bank, but that it still had only a relatively small presence.\n\"So if we had any opportunities to expand any further, we'd like to take them, because we know the market and we think we could provide a pretty good service there,\" he said.  \nMurray agreed that the only large bank in New Zealand not already owned by CBA or its Australian competitors was the National Bank of New Zealand Ltd, which is owned by Lloyds TSB Group Plc.\nMurray said CBA had enough capital on hand to handle routine expansion and therefore would continue with its current high dividend payout ratio. CBA would go back to shareholders either to adjust its dividend payout ratio or to raise capital through a share issue if it wanted to make a larger than routine acquisition, Murray said.\nHe would not specify how big a war-chest CBA had.  \nMeanwhile, Murray said the squeeze in home loan margins from about 300 basis points early last year to about 150 basis points now may have reached its limit.\nCBA stunned the home lending market on Wednesday when it cut its key variable home mortgage rate to 7.55 percent from 8.25 percent, its second unilateral rate cut in less than a year. A similar sized unilateral cut in May last year was seen as the catalyst to a significant cut in big bank home loan margins.\n\"We're either at or fast approaching a margin which is very competitive in world terms for home mortgages,\" Murray told reporters.  \n\"I therefore believe that the process from here will be incremental.\"\nMurray also took the opportunity to dismiss speculation that CBA was about to securitise its entire home loan portfolio and return the then un-necessary capital to shareholders.\nHe said the global trend  mutual funds would increase the pressure for funding mortgages through securitisation.\n\"This does not mean that we are going to run out tomorrow and securitise our whole home loan book because there is not enough buyers out there and enough funds to take it because of their asset allocations,\" he said.  \n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n", "Struggling computer products retailer Egghead Inc.

The store shutdowns over the next two months will reduce Egghead operations to 24 markets from 54.\nAmong the markets the company is exiting are Atlanta, Las Vegas, Miami, Philadelphia and San Diego. Egghead is closing 12 stores in the Los Angeles area and eight in Chicago.\nBender said more than 300 of the company's 1,800 employees would lose their jobs, including all employees at the Lancaster, Pa., distribution facility, which is being shuttered. The company also will sell its Spokane headquarters facility, which it moved into less than two years ago.\nFor the third quarter ended Dec. 28, Egghead reported net income of $1.5 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a loss of $941,000, or 5 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.

The council lobbied the Hong Kong government's Civil Aviation Department to declare the surcharge illegal and, after warning letters were issued, some airlines quickly agreed to withdraw the fuel surcharge but raise market rates instead.\nThese airlines have increased ex-Hong Kong rates by HK$1.80 per kilo and include Alitalia, Emirates, Cargolux, Virgin Atlantic Martinair, Swissair and Air Hong Kong\nLufthansa Cargo, which had refused to withdraw its surcharge, raised its rate by HK$1 from January 1 and is also maintaining a separate 80 cents surcharge imposed before Christmas, according to an airline source. ....\"We have informed the agents that we will increase our rates by one dollar and the 80 cents fuel fee or surcharge will be maintained but no longer shown on the airway bill which we think should solve the problem,\" the source said.\nOne of the leading advocates of a surcharge, Air France Cargo, raised its market rate by HK$1 from January 1 and is continuing with its 80 HK cents fuel surcharge, the airline's Hong Kong regional manager Philippe Bour told Reuters.\n\"The bottom line is the same with a HK$1.80 rise but we respect our commitment and have to be fair to our customers. As soon as the fuel price drops then we will cancel the fuel surcharge,\" Bour said.\nHong Kong's home carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways Limited which did not impose any fuel surcharge, raised its rate by HK$1.50 from January 1, the airline's general manager cargo, James Barrington said.\nOne airline cargo manager, who asked not to be named, said the fuel surcharge issue was a \"very touchy subject\" but it was not worth provoking more confrontation with the Hong Kong government.\nSam Chung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents, which represents more than 260 of the territory's agents, said all major airlines had raised rates apparently in anticipation of heavy demand before Chinese new year early next month.\n\"The fuel surcharge which we thought was illegal has gone and the airlines have raised their rates instead which we can't argue about.\"\nBritish Airways, a major cargo carrier to Europe with twice daily passenger flights and dedicated freighter flights, said it would \"wait and see\" before deciding on any rate rise.\n-- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017\n", "Hong Kong's future government has hit a new snag, with a shortage of trained staff forcing it to cancel a sitting of a controversial legislature preparing new laws ahead of the territory's handover to China.\nIt is the latest in a series of difficulties facing Tung Chee-hwa, the China-backed shipping magnate who will rule Hong Kong after the British pull out at midnight on June 30.\nTung's office said on Wednesday that this Saturday's session of the provisional legislature, which had been scheduled to deal with a draft law on new flags, had been dropped from the diary. Just a briefing would take place.\n\"The draft bills aren't ready because there aren't enough people,\" Bob Howlett, a spokesman for Tung's office, told Reuters. He said Tung's coordinator, Michael Suen, concluded the office did not have enough draftsmen to prepare planned laws.\n\"He doesn't want to see a rushed job done on anything,\" Howlett said.\nBut Tung's office issued a statement saying the bills would be passed in good time before the July 1 handover.\n\"We are doing the best we can with our limited resources. We are firmly committed to completing the drafting of all essential bills in good time for their passage by the Provisional Legislature Council before July 1.\"\nBritish Governor Chris Patten has refused to second more staff to the Tung office from the Hong Kong civil service to help the future government ready itself for the handover.\nThe office has only two law drafters on its staff.\nCommunist-ruled China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong, a British colony for the last 156 years, under a 1984 treaty that allows the territory virtual autonomy for another 50 years.\nChina, angered by democratic reforms introduced by Patten in the twilight years of British rule, set up the provisional legislature in December to replace the democratically elected Legislative Council (Legco).\nMany of China's critics consider the interim body unconstitutional.\n\"I think it's a good thing there's now no legislation going forward this week, and it would be even better if no legislation goes forward at any time, because anything they do handle between now and June 30 is vulnerable to legal challenge after the first of July,\" said Patten's spokesman, Kerry McGlynn.\n\"That can't be in anybody's interests. We've always made it perfectly plain, and will continue to do so up to June 30, that we'll do nothing to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the current Legco by providing any kind of assistance to the provisional legislature,\" McGlynn told Reuters.\nA spokesman for the provisional legislature said the body would now organise a briefing on Saturday on the planned civil rights curbs, instead of a full-fledged legislative session, at its base in the Chinese border town of Shenzhen.\nTung's run-up to his new job as Hong Kong chief executive has been a bumpy one.\nSino-British disputes were stoked this month after Tung launched a plan to curb political liberties such as the right to protest and the right of political groups to receive foreign funds. He provoked a domestic and international outcry.\nLast week he admitted to the media that he had donated 50,000 stg ($81,500) to the ruling British Conservative Party in 1992, sparking cries of hypocrisy.\n", "JAMtv, a six-month-old online company started by a Chicago music promoter, hopes to turn the personal computer into a personalized jukebox.\nAs a first step, the company will unveil on Monday a music network on the Internet using multimedia technology from Intel Corp..\nJAMtv plans to broadcast live concerts, link with radio stations for other programming, sell CDs and other merchandise and provide daily news and reviews.\nThe company is also working with privately held BackWeb, one of the leading \"push\" technology companies, which broadcasts personalized news and information directly to a person's PC.\n\"The goal is that you will have your own personal jukebox on your computer,\" Howard Tullman, chief executive of JAMtv, said.\nJAMtv spun out from Jam Productions Ltd, a well-known concert producer and promoter in Chicago whose co-founder, Jerry Mickelsen, is chairman.\nThe company hopes its network will become the main source of music on the Internet, featuring contemporary and alternative rock arists and eventually country and jazz.\nBut JAMtv is not trying to be the MTV of the Internet, Tullman stressed.\nHe noted that in recent years MTV has had to change its programming to offer more shows and features, like the \"Real World\" soap opera, because MTV viewers tired of someone else making their programming decisions for them.\n\"It's a network of one,\" Tullman said of the planned JAMtv service.\n\"Anytime you go there, you can listen to what you want. You don't have to wait for someone to make these programming decisions for you,\" he said. \"We will let you design your profile and what you want.\"\nHe said the JAMtv site on the World Wide Web will have daily events, with a calender of more than 1,500 events already planned for this year based on upcoming Jam Productions events, such as a U2 concert in Soldier Field in Chicago as part of the group's tour.\nUsers of the JAMtv site can also buy from a catalog of more than 140,000 music CDs, 70,000 music and entertainment videos and access an archive of images, audio, video and other data on hundreds of artists.\nTullman also said JAMtv was talking to computer makers and to Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Commuications Corp. in an effort in get a spot on the Windows desktop and a part of the Netscape browser, so that users will be able to simply click on an icon and have their JAMtv.\nJAMtv is also embracing Intel's \"hybrid\" method of sending fat audio and video files over the Internet, by providing users with compact disks of some audio and video, which is then supplemented by updated audio and video streams sent over the Internet.\nThe company hopes to make money is several ways, by selling merchandise over the Internet, by selling advertising and licensing fees to radio affiliates for programming and through compiling databases on subscribers which it could sell to record companies.\nUltimately, Tullman said, a big JAMtv revenue stream will come from a \"pay-per-view\" distribution of live concerts on the Internet.\n\"At the end of the day, when you can truly go home at night and click on your PC and watch any concert you want, there will be pay per view revenues in this business,\" Tullman said.\n", "Stowaway deaths in the holds of cargo ships leaving West Africa are prompting calls for concerted international action to combat the problem.\nDockers at one port in Britain found the bodies of seven young Africans amid the cargo in ships carrying variously cocoa, coconut and oilseeds.\nThree Africans died in the hold of another cocoa ship in Ivory Coast's main port Abidjan in February after inhaling toxic pecticides, leading to rejection of the 10,000 tonne consignment by American buyers.\nVeterans in the cocoa trade recall the curious case of an African head that turned up in a sack of cocoa from Nigeria.\n\"The West African problem is fairly intense at the moment,\" says Chris Horrocks, Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Shipping.\n\"Industry has to gear up Western governments to bring the matter up but as their interests are not directly at stake it is often a token gesture,\" he said by telephone from London.\nBritish Prime Minister John Major agrees something needs to be done.\n\"We do need to examine both with the host countries and with the shipping lines better arrangements to ensure that they (stowaways) are not hidden away on their ships,\" he told parliament in response to a question.\nGOVERNMENTS RELUCTANT TO ACT\nBut shipping officials say governments fail to act out of fear of facing the bills for handling stowaways, a cost normally borne by shipping lines and their insurers.\nHorrocks said the U.N. International Maritime Organisation in London had set up a committee to consider recommendations for a convention on stowaways but a rapid conclusion was unlikely.\nMany stowaways, fugitives from war or poverty, are looking for a better life in the West. Others simply want adventure.\n\"One boy was found at Marseille with his toothbrush and identity papers,\" said a shipping agent who investigates such cases. \"He asked us to send him back home so he didn't miss any more classes. He was a real Tom Sawyer type.\"\nMost stowaways carry no proof of identity or nationality, prolonging procedures for repatriation or granting of asylum.\nIvory Coast, a beacon of economic and political stability in West Africa, has become a magnet for stowaways from neighbouring states -- especially Nigeria, Ghana and war-ravaged Liberia.\nPort police say about 200 cases were reported in Ivory Coast in 1996.\n\"Stowaways slip on board from the lagoons at night or climb over port walls,\" said an Ivorian Transport Ministry spokesman. \"How to stop them is purely a police matter.\"\nSOME DEATHS MAY NEVER GET REPORTED\nInvestigators say many cases probably go unreported. \"If bodies are found at sea they are reported at the destination port but some are probably thrown overboard,\" one said.\nShipping agents say port security is very low on the list of priorities in the African countries concerned. Posting extra port guards is costly and of little value when guards can be bribed to turn a blind eye.\n\"All African ports suffer from the same problem,\" said a ship surveyor who has worked in most of Africa's principal ports for over 25 years. \"We always have a number of cases in hand.\"\n\"People talk about complicity of the crew but I find it hard to believe stowaways are paying for their passage. Most are completely destitute when they get on board.\"\nAs immigration laws around the world are tightened, particularly in rich countries targeted by stowaways, captains find it more and more difficult to land illegal passengers.\nThey face the prospect of having to keep stowaways on board for years or heavy fines or jail for letting them ashore.\nSOME STRIKE IT LUCKY, MANY DON'T\nSome stowaways reach their promised land. Some manage to stay there. Many don't.\nThe unlucky ones drown, starve, suffocate.\nEleven Nigerians survived a three-day ordeal off South Africa's Dyer Island in January when they were cast adrift on an oil-drum raft in shark-infested waters.\nSeven Ghanaians who stowed away on a cocoa ship heading for France were not so lucky. Their plight -- and the story of an eighth stowaway who survived -- became the subject of a joint British-American film released in Ghana and worldwide last October.\nThe case highlighted problems of international jurisdiction over murders at sea. Testimony of the survivor, Kingsley Ofusu, before a French court in 1996 led to murder convictions for the Ukrainian captain and crew of the MC Ruby.\nGhana launched a campaign to publicise the deaths and discourage other would-be stowaways.\nIt has also tightened security at the ports but the lure of the bright lights of Europe and the Americas remains a powerful incentive -- as the rising death toll illustrates.\n", "Former NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff was named chairman of the board of America Online Inc.'s original content division, Greenhouse Networks, the online giant announced Monday.\nThe world's No. 1 online service also said it was buying LightSpeed Media, a pioneer producer of Internet soap operas and shows. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nAs part of the deal, Vienna, Va.-based Greenhouse Networks said it would develop an interactive entertainment network, slated for launch this fall.\nThe entertainment network will be based in Los Angeles and will capitalise on Lightspeed's and Tartikoff's relationships in the entertainment industry.\nAmerica Online's deal with Tartikoff expands a previous arrangement announced last fall for the executive to develop original interactive brands to be launched simultaneously online, on television and as books.\nTartikoff, who was president of NBC Entertainment from 1980 to 1991, currently heads his own television and production company, H. Beale Co., in Los Angeles.\nTartikoff will continue to head his own production company and act as a consultant and adviser to America Online as chairman of Greenhouse, America Online said.\nLightSpeed was behind the first so-called \"episodic\" show on the Internet, called \"The Spot,\" which it sold to American Cybercast early last year. \"The Spot,\" an interactive soap opera about five people sharing a house on a California beach, is still on the Web site of American Cybercast, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.\nLightSpeed was founded in May 1996 by the creators of \"The Spot\" after American Cybercast bought the programme. Founder Scott Zakarin will be named president of programming.\nZakarin and his team launched another Internet soap -- -- \"GrapeJam\" -- last August.\nAmerica Online executives said Internet soap operas will be only one small part of its broad entertainment network, which will feature celebrity hosts, live events, news and other information about the entertainment industry.\n\"The focus (of the network) is on the entertainment industry and the entertainment business,\" said Greenhouse President Danny Krifcher. He declined to say how big the venture will be.\nAmerica Online plans to make money from the entertainment network through advertising revenues, licensing and through transactions, such as selling tickets to entertainment events, selling merchandise and offering premium information at a surcharge. But Krifcher declined to make any forecasts.\nThe closest competition America Online said it has on the Internet to the entertainment network are sites such as Mr. Showbiz, E! Online and a People magazine site devoted to entertainment.\n\"This is a very big opportunity,\" Krifcher said. \"This is the beginning of what we think will be a series of exciting announcements and developments for us.\"\nAmerica Online stock rose $3 to $45 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "Horacio Serpa, Colombia's Interior Minister and the strongman of President Ernesto Samper's administration, resigned on Tuesday to prepare his bid for the presidency.\nIn accepting Serpa's public letter of resignation, Samper wished his right-hand man \"every success in your new activities\" in a laudatory reply made available to the media.\n\"Long ago, I took the commitment to serve the country in public office and I wish to continue that task ... I present my resignation from my current post,\" Serpa said in his letter to Samper that revealed the pair's close political and personal friendship.\nThe move comes less than a week before the May 31 deadline by which prospective candidates must step down from public office if they wish to run in the May 1998 elections to choose Samper's successor.\nSerpa, 53, a ruling Liberal Party member, has been at the helm of the Interior Ministry since Samper took office in August 1994. An able politician and fiery public speaker, Serpa earned himself a reputation as the president's staunchest ally, defending him against accusations that he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug money from the infamous Cali cartel.\nSamper was cleared of wrongdoing in a congressional inquiry last year. But Serpa, one of the campaign organisers, is still under investigation on suspicion of knowingly accepting illicit donations.\n\"These years have been a great and difficult experience. There has never been so much controversy or such acute confrontations,\" Serpa said in his letter, in reference to the drug-funding scandal that has dogged most of Samper's rule.\nIn addition to rounding on Samper's opponents at home, Serpa launched outspoken attacks against the president's fiercest international critic -- the United States.\nHe recently dubbed U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette, a \"sick gringo\" for what he claimed was the envoy's constant meddling in Colombia's internal affairs, especially those relating to anti-drug policy.\nIn the letter accepting his minister's resignation, Samper wrote: \"In these times devoid of values and ideals, your brave attitudes against violence, corruption ... or in defence of sovereignty are refreshing examples of a clean career.\"\nRecent opinions polls show Serpa lagging behind the former Chief Prosecutor turned presidential candidate Alfonso Valdivieso, a thorn in the side of Samper's administration for his pursuit of political corruption.\nBut Valdivieso, also a Liberal, shunned his party's backing and announced that he would run as an independent. Serpa, meanwhile, is likely to be able to count on the full political and financial support of the well-greased party machinery, which political analysts believe will greatly strengthen his hand as the presidential campaign gets into full swing.\n", "China's Deng Xiaoping launched the greatest economic boom on earth and justified his reforms to doubting Marxist ideologues with one deceptively simple phrase.\nThe maxim that Deng used as an ideological figleaf to cover his near-heretical treatment of Marxist economics was \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\".\nThe phrase that would justify private enterprise, ownership of property and lifting of price controls in a state run by the Communist Party saw the light of day in Deng's opening speech to the 12th party congress on September 1, 1982.\n\"We must integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of China, blaze a path of our own and build a socialism with Chinese characteristics -- that is the basic conclusion we have reached after summing up long historical experience,\" Deng told the elders of the central committee.\nThe congress was crucial for Deng's nascent economic reforms, already running into resistance from his orthodox Marxist colleagues who feared -- rightly as it turned out -- that his employment of market forces would erode three decades of Stalinist command economics.\n\"Deng's greatest contribution of all was that simple phrase 'Chinese characteristics',\" said one Western diplomat.\n\"It ensured that you could do anything you thought was appropriate. It should be engraved on his tomb.\"\nThat single phrase enabled Deng to dump the revolutionary fervour nurtured by the late chairman Mao Zedong in favour of doing pretty much what he wanted.\n\"This was a huge leap forward compared with the Mao era,\" said a Chinese political scientist. \"This sentence guided China on to the path of modernisation. It marked the shift from Mao's path to Deng's path and enabled Deng to do an enormous number of things.\"\nIt ended the sole system of public ownership. Collective and private enterprises were born. It also ended cradle-to-grave care and control by the party.\nChinese could be sacked, they could resign. They were free to find their own jobs. They could move house. They had to pay for their own education and medical care.\nThe command economy gave way to market forces.\nWhat Deng created was no longer socialism, neither was it capitalism.\nIt was somewhere in between. It was socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n", "British mutual insurer Norwich Union said on Thursday strong demand had led it to increase the members' offer in next week's flotation to 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion).\nThat means some 400 million pounds worth of shares will be clawed back from the public offering, primarily financial institutions, to satisfy members' appetite for extra shares which saw many queuing to beat the June 10 deadline.\nSome 800 million pounds worth of shares had originally been set aside to meet members' applications but this proved insufficient as members' rushed to top up their holdings at a 25 pence per share discount to the public offer price.\nFor Norwich, the flotation will bring to an end more than 200 years as a mutual with policyholders owning the company.\nDemutualisation will allow it to separate the group's life operations and thus policyholders' returns from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business.\nIt will also strengthen Norwich's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom.\nThe flotation is likely to value Norwich, which has more than seven million customers, at around 5.5 billion pounds and create Britain's third-largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance.\nNearly three million Norwich policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares in addition to the extra discounted shares.\nNorwich still expects the offer price to range between 240 pence and 290 pence per share suggesting large profits for those lucky enough to get extra shares.\nBookmakers City Index are taking bets on a first day closing price of between 335 pence and 345 pence, an immediate profit of at least 70 pence per share.\nIt would put the value of the minimum 300 free shares with profits members will receive at over 1,000 pounds.\nMany will receive far more depending on the value and duration of their policies.\nNon-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares.\nInstitutional demand is a big factor in the likely sharp gains over the offer price.\nThe two building societies who floated recently -- Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leceister -- saw their share price squeezed higher by financial institutions keen to buy the shares and maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios.\nLike Halifax, Norwich is almost certain to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies.\nThe public offer, which is made up of the institutional offer, retail offer and employees offer, will be between 1.1 and 1.2 billion pounds following the clawback of the extra shares for members.\nNews of the final public and members' offer price and provisional basis of allocation is expected to be made on June 15.

Its aggressive strategy of creating a nationwide auto dealership network has sparked lawsuits by Japanese motor giants Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.

In its suit filed last week, Honda said AutoNation was cheapening its Honda and Acura brands.\nBoth companies limit the number of dealerships which can be owned by one propietor and have said AutoNation wants to control 20 percent of their U.S. sales.\nHuizenga this week shrugged off the lawsuits, saying that AutoNation never aspired to control one of every five Toyota and Honda sales in the United States.\n\"We never said 20 percent and we never expected to get that much,\" Huizenga told the annual shareholders meeting of Republic on Tuesday. \"We know we will be partners with them.\"\nHuizenga, credited with creating giant video-retailer Blockbuster and Waste Management Corp., said AutoNation can take minority stakes in Toyota and Honda dealerships or use other techniques for tapping into the strong sales flows of highly popular Toyota and Honda vehicles.\n\"There are ways to accomplish what we want,\" Huizenga said.

With profit margins of more than 14 percent, Unilever's businesses \"are at the good end of the range,\" said Williams de Broe analyst Peter Cartwright.\n\"This is a highly saleable and attractive portfolio,\" Kleinwort Benson analyst Jeremy Chantry said. He added that the businesses were likely to be sold \"in big pieces.\"\nAnother analyst, who asked not to be named, said U.S.-based National Starch, which makes industrial adhesives, resins and speciality starches, could fetch 1.3 to 1.5 times its annual sales.\nThe Quest fragrances and flavorings business and the Unichema natural oils businesses, both based in the Netherlands, might be worth 1.5 times their annual turnover.\nWith no obvious buyer for the whole package, speculation centred on possible interest for the different segments.\nWilliams de Broe's Cartwright said industrial adhesives and resins could both be a target for Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries Plc , which wants to buy lighter chemicals operations and move away from industrial products.\nAnalysts said ICI, which has little debt, could also be interested in the petroleum and plastics catalysts business of British-based Crosfield.\nAnother analyst said National Starch could interest other U.S. firms. \"A lot of the big processors in the States, like Cargill, make raw starch and haven't moved on into the value-added chain, which is what National Starch is in. Those big food processors may be interested in that,\" he added.\nSwitzerland's Roche Holding AG spent $1.1 billion last week buying flavors group Tastemaker. Another major player in the sector, International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. of the United States, said last year it was not interested in buying another flavors company, but it could be attracted by Quest's investment in biotechnology.\nUnichema, whose products include lubricants and ingredients for polymers, soap and skincare products, might be of interest to one of the five or six major players in this segment.

He said the company was notified a day or two later and it promptly advised the FDA and St. Jude.\nThe identity of the patient is not being disclosed.\nOn Jan. 16, Ventritex said it had been authorised by the FDA to begin reprogramming 5,605 implantable defibrillators in patients. The company said then that component failures in the devices were believed to be associated with the deaths of two patients.\nAn implantable defibrillator, or ICD, is a device about the size of a pocket pager that is implanted in the chest or abdomen and connected to the heart by internal wires. Like a pacemaker, the ICD regularly sends small electrical shocks to the heart. But where a pacemaker keeps the heart from slowing down, an ICD keeps it from beating too rapidly.\nMeltzer said substantial progress has been made in Ventritex's efforts to find the patients who carry the 5,605 implantable defibrillators that need to be reprogrammed.

On Tuesday, Rooney resigned, just a week after his ouster was demanded by an investment group controlled by financier George Soros, another major shareholder of WMX.\nEarlier this month, under shareholder presssue, WMX named John Sanford as its new chief financial officer. Formerly WMX treasurer, he replaced James Koenig, who became executive vice president. Minow said Lens is dissatisfied with Sanford.\n\"The new one I would like to see reassigned, as well, or gone,\" Minow said. \"They need to bring in an outsider.\"  \nLens and other shareholders are unhappy with the WMX CFO's office, according to Minow. \"It's their inability to meet their projections, their inability to let a year go by without some special charge, that I think speaks very badly for the credibility of that office, to say nothing of (WMX's) muddled, overall structure,\" she said.\nRegarding the search for a new CEO, Minow said, \"We'd like to see someone who's got a proven track record in a turnaround situation.

Schroders' cost/income ratio was 75 percent, compared to 75.4 pct in 1995.\nHe said Schroders' profits, both pre and post tax, were up by over 20 percent but bonuses had risen slightly below this in total.  \nSpiralling bonuses in the industry as a whole were, he said, the result of a battle going on between a number of major investment banking players to become one of the five or six global powerhouses.\n\"Sooner or later the damage that some will suffer (means) they will withdraw and the cycle will change,\" he said, adding that Schroders did not count itself among this group.\nHe said many were desperate to get into asset management, where Schroders posted an improved return in 1996, as they did not have the balanced portfolio Schroders did.\nSedgwick said the firm was an \"advisory-relationship type investment bank\" and was not heavily dependent on proprietory trading, has a strong balance sheet, no borrowing, cash reserves and a good asset management business.\nHe said Schroders was not aiming to be a Merrill Lynch or a Goldman Sachs. \"It is not our strategy to be in that game.\"\nAnd commenting on long-standing speculation that Schroders could be involved in a merger or a takeover by a larger firm, Sedgwick said \"There is absolutely no intention of changing Schroders as is. We are not up for sale, we are not out for merger, we do not want a big brother and we are not in the acquisition stakes.\"\n\"We are not in the business of losing our independence,\" he said, adding that Schroders would grow organically.\n-- London newsroom +44 171 542 7719\n", "Brewer to leisure group Whitbread Plc can expect to raise about 100 million stg from the sale of its underperforming retail sites in 1997/98, said chief executive Peter Jarvis in an interview on Friday.\n\"We now have such a wide range of retail brands and a fast and sizeable programme of new openings, that we are able to dispose of older premises that simply cannot be upgraded,\" said Jarvis.\nRecession in the early 1990's has made consumers more discerning so that they now pick their favoured restaurants and pubs more carefully, he said.\nThe company's 1,700 strong Whitbread Inns, which forms about 40 percent of group profits, added 80 sites this financial year and sold 50, with the modern sites generally much bigger and often designed to include a Travel Inn.\nSome of the company's Beefeater restaurant-pubs are too old in design to be upgraded and other outlets are unlikely to prove economic over the medium term where for instance the local economy has turned down.\n\"We are constantly trying to improve the average within the portfolio,\" said Jarvis.\nThe advent of a more flexible property market -- in terms of lease back sale arrangements and fewer freeholds -- and much improved property prices will also enable Jarvis' sucessor David Thomas to accelerate the disposal and upgrade programme.\n\"He (Thomas) will be able to churn sites faster than I have been able to.\"\n\"He is likely to dispose of more in the next five years than myself.\"\nThomas will take over as chief executive in the summer when Jarvis steps down.\n- Tim Farrand, London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437\n", "Engineering group Skoda a.s. said on Tuesday it had won an order to supply more than $170 million in trolleybuses to the city of San Francisco, the largest supply of Czech goods ever to the United States.\nSkoda spokesman Jaroslav Hudec said the electric-powered buses would be produced in the Czech Republic and assembled at Skoda's subsidiary, Electric Transit International (ETI) in Baltimore.\n\"We consider victory in this tender to be an extraordinary success not only in view of the expected volumes of supplies...but also because the U.S. market is among the most prestigious and demanding in the world,\" Hudec said.\nPlzen-based Skoda, no longer affiliated with the Czech car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s., has made an aggressive push into new markets, aiming to offer western-quality units with the comparative cost advantage of eastern European production.\nThe San Francisco contract would open the way for Skoda, an engineering conglomerate which makes goods ranging from nuclear power components to drink cans, to win more business in the United States, Hudec said.\n\"Considering the ecologisation of public transport in the U.S., Skoda Plzen has real chances to win further orders... and also bring the brand Skoda to the U.S. market in relation to other production of our factories,\" he said.\nSkoda has made over 12,000 trolleybuses since 1936 -- many of which can be seen running in cities throughout the former communist bloc.\nLocal Czech media reports quoted ETI officials as saying the San Francisco order could be for about 250 single-section and higher capacity buses through to the year 2000.\nThe total for the order with details of the financial and technical conditions would be finalised by mid-year, Hudec said, but declined to give further details.\nEarlier this decade Skoda won a contract to supply 54 trolley buses to the city of Dayton, Ohio, and founded a U.S. joint venture with private partners in Baltimore, ETI, to assemble the buses. Skoda holds a majority stake in ETI.\nThe Dayton supply is scheduled to be completed in 1998. Skoda said it is also pursuing joint ventures to build trolley buses in Russian and Iran.\nGuy Creasy, equities analyst at IB Austria Securities in Prague, said that while the San Francisco order was indeed a positive signal for Skoda shares, lingering questions over the cost of recent acquisitions remained.\n\"I don't think (the order) is a drop in the bucket, but I don't think it will make the difference between profit and loss,\" he said. \"I don't think it will make us change (Skoda's share recommendation) to a 'buy'.\"\nCreasy said that it was not yet clear how earnings from the order would be divided with Skoda's U.S. partners.\nAnalysts have been wary about Skoda shares, awaiting 1996 results which should show the impact of buying two ailing Czech truck makers, Liaz a.s. and Tatra a.s..\nSkoda shares gained 25 crowns in Tuesday's fixing on the Prague Stock Exchange to 871 crowns, reversing a downtrend in the stock which ended 52 crowns lower on Monday.

The panel extended the deadline on the 782 million British pound ($1.3 billion) bid from Dec. 20 until Dec. 24.\nThe panel extended the fiercely fought bid on Friday in what newspaper reports said was a reaction to BZW's initial failure to disclose an extra 250,000 pound ($417,000) fee related to its performance in the bid.\n\"Following the investigation, the executive will consider what, if any, further action is appropriate,\" the panel said in a brief statement.\nThe panel noted it may also look into the acquisition by BZW and investment bank Schroders of 2.32 percent of Northern Electric's shares last week.\nAs the initial deadline expired, CE had obtained control of only 49.77 percent of Northern. But after the deadline was extended until Christmas Eve, CE notched that total up to 50.13 percent, a majority that would have given it victory.\nBut acceptances after the initial deadline require consent from the Takeover Panel. Northern is now fighting to appeal the extension to try to make the late acceptances null and void and to retain its independence.\n\"If the panel rejects the right to appeal, or the appeal fails, then Northern will be taken over. If the appeal committee says the panel was wrong to extend the bid, then Northern stays independent,\" said one analyst who declined to be identified.\nAt Northern's request, dealing in its shares was temporarily suspended from Monday morning, standing at 638 pence ($10.68), pending the conclusion of the appeal process.\nCE, which is 70 percent owned by Omaha-based CalEnergy, then complained to the panel last week about share purchases made by BZW and Schroders. The panel said there was nothing wrong with those share purchases but did rule out further buying by BZW and Schroders when it extended the deadline.\nA BZW official told Reuters that the fee from Northern was not in any way linked to BZW buying of Northern shares.\nNorthern had fought hard to fend off CE Electric's 650 pence ($10.88) per share bid, which it claimed undervalued the company, promising a 17 percent rise in its final dividend and lower than expected debt.\nCE Electric, which raised its original 630 pence ($10.55) offer on Dec. 6, maintained that it was offering a fair price and has already bought nearly 30 percent of Northern on the market. It has said it will hang on to that stake even if its bid fails, which analysts said could depress Northern's shares.\nThe bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds ($933 million) fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year.\n", "The Czech government on Wednesday directed three of its ministers to oversee an investigation into the failure of the bank Kreditni Banka a.s., Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said.\nThe move comes after the press and opposition questioned official banking oversight in the case of the Plzen-based bank which was shut by the central bank last month after reportedly losing about 12 billion crowns.\nKlaus told a news conference after a cabinet meeting that Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky would join Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda, and Interior Minister Jan Ruml in overseeing the probe.\n\"Bearing in mind the extraordinary importance of this matter, the govenrnment authorised the group of three ministers to specially inquire into this issue, using all existing standard mechanisms,\" Klaus said.\nHe said authorities have been investigating the Kreditni case since the central bank rescinded its licence in August.\nFindings from the investigation might lead to changes in Czech legislation, Klaus said.\nLocal media reports have placed the blame for the failure of Kreditni Banka, majority owned by the largest Czech insurer Ceska Pojistovna a.s. , on a series of murky loans made to interests connected to shareholders.\nThe leader of the opposition Social Democrats, Milos Zeman, last weekend blamed Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and his ministry for lax supervision of the banks.\nAfter Klaus's announcement, the central bank issued a statement on Wednesday, saying it welcomed the group of ministers looking at whether there was any criminal actions involved in Kreditni's failure.\nIt said combining the investigatory organs with, tax, legal, banking oversight, and capital market authorities, would help in \"uncovering illegal activity\" and determining its punishment.\n\"The CNB believes that through this work it will be possible to solve other cases as well in which the banking supervision has submitted a number of criminal reports on the basis of its knowledge gained in other banks,\" the central bank's statement said.\nEleven banks have fallen under CNB authority since the liberalisation of the sector began in earnest in 1992.\nKlaus attributed the failures of the banks -- all of them small or medium sized -- to growing pains in the still-transforming post-Communist Czech economy.\n\"I am 100 percent persuaded that the dominant cause of these phenomenona... is the difficulity, fragility, complexity of banking in the transformation phase,\" Klaus said.\nKlaus, in numerous previous speeches has declared that the \"transformation phase\" was over and the economy was \"in the fitness centre building muscle\".\nBut Klaus has been under pressure by opposition deputies who have demanded answers on the banking failures.\n\"The government condemns the way of politicising of this important situation by the opposition, which could intendidly or not, lead to the destabilisation of the the whole banking system,\" Klaus said.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "Canada's Barrick Gold Corp on Monday dropped out of the race to control the vast Busang gold find in Indonesia, losing a long battle for the right to mine the deposit to U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc.\nBut analysts warned that the struggle to control Busang, possibly the world's biggest gold deposit, may not have ended. Placer Dome Inc, another big Canadian mining concern, said it has not given up hope of grabbing a piece of Busang.\n\"This thing is far from over,\" said Fred Ketchen, vice-president of Toronto brokerage ScotiaMcLeod.\nCalgary's Bre-X Minerals Ltd, which discovered the 71-million-ounce Busang gold find, announced on Monday it had reached a deal with Freeport, shortly before an Indonesian government deadline was due to expire.\nUnder the deal, Freeport will own 15 percent of Busang find, Bre-X will keep 45 percent and Indonesian interests will take 40 percent.\nThe deal convinced Barrick, which has spent months negotiating for control of Busang, to give up its quest.\n\"We put forward our proposal last week and said to Bre-X that if you can find a better deal, we wish you success,\" spokesman Vince Borg said. \"For us to go beyond the proposal would not be in the best interest of our shareholders.\"\nHe declined to elaborate on Barrick's final offer, citing a confidentiality agreement.\nMany details needed to evaluate the Freeport deal remained a mystery on Monday, causing confusion in the stock market.\nBre-X said Freeport, based in Louisiana, will provide US$400 million or 25 percent of the capital costs of the Busang project. Freeport will borrow US$1.2 billion to fund the rest of the costs. But neither Bre-X nor Freeport would say how much would be paid to Bre-X.\n\"We're not making a comment until the (Indonesian) government announcement tomorrow,\" said a Freeport spokeswoman in New Orleans.\nSince Bre-X did not mention any compensation from Indonesian interests or Freeport, observers have to assume there will be none, analysts said. Most analysts put a C$25 to C$30 target on Bre-X shares. The shares opened at C$25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday and sank quickly to C$23.50 by midafternoon.\n\"This has been very expensive for Bre-X. But Freeport has a pretty good deal here,\" said Rick Cohen, gold analyst at Goepel Shields in Vancouver.\nThe government of Indonesian President Suharto is expected to respond on Tuesday to the proposed deal. Freeport and Bre-X need government approval before going ahead.\n\"It's a tremendous loss for Barrick,\" said Cohen.\nBarrick, the world's second biggest gold producer, had maneuvered aggressively to grab control of Busang, spending months negotiating with Bre-X and Indonesian officials.\nIt formed an alliance with Suharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and used its powerful advisory board -- which includes former U.S. president George Bush and former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney -- to cultivate ties with other influential Indonesians.\nMeanwhile, Placer Dome Chief Executive Officer John Willson, said his company would re-evaluate its US$5 billion offer to merge with Bre-X, but would still be willing to use its financial resources and expertise to help develop Busang.\n\"Given the size, complexity and importance of Busang to Indonesia, we remain prepared to contribute our financial resources and unique mine development capabilities to this very attractive project,\" Willson said. \"Naturally, we are disappointed by the news that we were not selected as the developer and operator.\"\nIf the Indonesian government grants Bre-X and Freeport the right to develop Busang, Bre-X could quickly become a takeover target for a large company that would not mind allowing Freeport operate the mine, analysts said.\nBut Barrick is unlikely to jump back into the race, said gold analyst Chad Williams with Research Capital in Montreal.\n\"I think Barrick would be apprehensive of buying out Bre-X because Bre-X is not the operator.

The company gets about 43 percent of its revenue from ethernet adapter cards: graham cracker-sized devices that plug into PCs to link them with networks.\nLast week, Intel, the world's biggest maker of PC components, cut prices of its line of fast ethernet cards sharply.

Meanwhile, Intel will use its huge manufacturing facilities and its cost benefit to undercut 3Com in ethernet prices, analysts said.\nPyykkonen said Intel could elbow aside networking suppliers, just as it knocked down suppliers of sound and video components by making multimedia functions a built-in feature of its microprocessors.\n\"There's no reason why networking can't go the way of PCs,\" Pyykkonen said.\n3Com's shortfall projection prompted several Wall Street analysts to slash their ratings on 3Com stock to hold or neutral.\n\"The tone of 3Com's business remains weak,\" said William Rabin, analyst at J.P.

There was no great outpouring of grief of the kind that accompanied Mao's death in September, 1976.\nWhen Mao died at age 82, weeping crowds poured out of factories and offices.\n\"It was like a family had lost its mother or the sky had collapsed,\" said a woman who was at high school then.\n\"We cried like we lost our father and mother,\" said a driver parked near Deng's residence in central Beijing. \"Now everyone is indifferent.\"\nBeijing announced six days of mourning for Deng, whose death at 92 on Wednesday closed the book on almost two decades of rule that transformed China into a budding economic powerhouse.\nBut in streets and offices it was business as usual, with no outward displays of grief. Street markets bustled and factories of the new economic powerhouse that Deng created hummed with activity.\n\"I am a little sad over Deng, but not shocked. People knew early on that Deng's health was poor,\" said a clerk bustling off to work.\n\"Deng doesn't measure up to the likes of Mao,\" said a 62-year-old sunflower seed vendor. \"I don't care one bit about Deng's death.\"\nResidents and political analysts said the greater freedom created by Deng's reformist economic policies changed the way Chinese regarded their leaders.\n\"This indicates people's attitudes towards the death of leaders has matured -- their minds are free,\" said a Chinese analyst who declined to be identified.\n", "The Czech crown, boosted recently by demand brought about by a wave of Eurobond issues, is showing no sign of losing strength, prompting market speculation on Wednesday of possible central bank intervention.\nThe Czech National Bank (CNB) has said it is monitoring the development of the crown, but is prepared to allow the market to decide its rate within the fluctuation band.\nSince the start of 1997 the currency has gained some three percentage points against its fixing basket, mainly on foreign buying to finance a wave of some 30 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) in new crown Eurobond issues.\nAnalysts said that while the crown may hold steady over the next day or two, it should again test 5.5 percent above its parity level next week.\n\"I don't expect much of a move higher this week, but next week the crown could again test +5.5 percent,\" said Martin Strauch, a dealer at Citibank.\nJakub Perina of Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka added: \"A lot depends on London traders because they are very interested right now.\"\nThe Czech crown is fixed daily at up to plus or minus 7.5 percent of the mid-point of a basket comprising 35 percent dollars and 65 percent marks.\nOn Wednesday, the Czech National Bank (CNB) fixed the crown at 27.712 to the dollar and 16.846 to the mark, putting the currency 5.05 percent above the mid-point.\n\"If the crown does not exceed its fluctuation band, the central bank will not intervene,\" CNB Spokesman Martin Svehla told the econoimc daily Hospodarske Noviny on Wednesday.\nLast February the CNB widened the corridor within which it fixes the crown each day to plus or minus 7.5 percent of parity, from plus/minus 0.5 percent.\nSince then the foreign exchange market, and not the central bank, has been much more of a force in determining the crown's rate within this controlled float.\nSeveral dealers, however, confirmed to Reuters that the CNB had contacted them on Tuesday when the crown hit 5.3 percent above parity, and said they took the move as a signal that intervention was possible whn the currency hit plus 6.0 percent.\n\"The market was a little spooked by this move, and the crown fell immediately,\" said one London-based analyst. \"But it regained its strength today, and I think many people now expect some intervention if it moves much higher.\"\nCSOB's Strauch said: \"They (the CNB) could be ready to intervene at some point, possibly +6.0 percent, but it depends on whether it appears to have strength to move even higher at that point.\"\nThe main underlying reason for foreign interest in the Czech crown is the large interest rate differential between the Czech Republic and western countries.\nIn the middle of 1996 the CNB raised the discount rate to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent and increased minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent.

The company, which has 725 stores in North America plus joint ventures in England, Mexico and Japan, posted fiscal 1996 sales of $944.6 million.\nHe said the company will open 53 stores this year and close about 25. Remodeling and remerchandising of store layouts is also under way throughout much of the chain, reflecting a change in product lines, he said.  \nAt the end of its fiscal year last month, Pier 1 stopped selling apparel. It is beefing up its home furnishings offerings in response to what it sees as changing consumer attitudes. \"The Martha Stewart syndrome is alive and well in America,\" Johnson said.\n\"There's been a shift in consumer spending away from apparel, and even in this past holiday season away from consumer electronics and toward home furnishings,\" he said.\nPier 1 is also launching a bridal registry program that Johnson said is expected to take further advantage of the trend toward higher sales of furniture, fixtures and other items for the home.\nThe company operates a joint venture in England called \"The Pier.\" Johnson said it is expected to break even this year after losing money last year.\nHe said expansion in Japan continues. \"We think it's possible to eventually have about 200 stores in Japan,\" he said.\n", "Citizens spilled into public places across China on Saturday to mourn the late leader Deng Xiaoping, acting spontaneously in the face of a lack of official memorial activities.\nState television has been running endless official paeans to Deng and showing formal mourning activities organised by Chinese officials in Hong Kong, Washington and other foreign cities.\nBut in China itself, and especially the capital Beijing, the state has done little to encourage public shows of mourning, leaving the citizenry to do things themselves.\nIn Deng's home village of Paifang in southwestern Sichuan province, tens of thousands of mourners have thronged to the courtyard of his birth since the community's favourite son died on Wednesday night.\nIn the Sichuan capital Chengdu, people poured into People's Square on Thursday and by nightfall the crowd swelled past 10,000, many carrying candles, witnesses said by telephone.\nIn the absence of a Deng portrait, people gathered round a statue of China's revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.\n\"For us here it's tumultuous,\" a worker at a hotel on the square told Reuters. \"Not only in Chengdu but all across Sichuan province, it's tumultuous.\"\nThe crowds thinned on Friday and Saturday, but officials were tolerating the square's use as a centre for mourning and many people were weeping openly over Deng's death. Many came on outings organised by their work units.\n\"There are several hundred police, traffic police and People's Armed Police to maintain order and prevent people getting hurt,\" the hotel worker said.\nIn the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, a special economic zone near Hong Kong that was Deng's earliest reform brainchild, hundreds of people filed past a giant Deng billboard which had been turned into a makeshift shrine.\nThe billboard stands in a square beside one of Deng's most stunning innovations, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which Deng said proved that markets were acceptable not only in capitalist societies but also under socialism.\nMourners placed wreaths of white and yellow chrysanthemums below the billboard, some draped with white streamers bearing Deng's reformist slogans or newspaper clippings about a 1992 visit Deng made to Shenzhen to jumpstart his stalling reforms.\n\"We wish you heavenly peace,\" read one streamer. Said another: \"Thank you for the reform and opening up.\"\n\"There's no public organised mourning of Deng, but I think this is better because people who come to mourn for Deng do it from the bottom of their hearts,\" said a policeman named Chen.\nAt Shenzhen's botanical garden, someone had hung a black and white portrait of Deng from a banyan tree that Deng planted in 1992. Scores of people burned incense and bowed three times in the traditional Chinese form of mourning.\n\"Uncle Deng, we miss you!\" wailed a kneeling man surnamed Jin who had brought his year-old child. \"Come child, pay your respect to Uncle Deng.\"\n\"I was shattered by the news of his death,\" Jin said later. \"He has done simply too much for us. I can find no words to express my grief and can only repay him by working harder.\"\nDeng's legacy of markets was quietly thriving at a nearby private floral shop, whose owner was doing brisk business selling a fresh shipment of flowers.\n\"Of course I'm happy.

Kraft is owned by Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the New York-based food and tobacco giant.\n\"Lender's Bagels is a perfect fit for Kellogg Company's fast-growing convenience foods business,\" Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said.\n\"With our heritage based in nutrition and our technical competence in grain-based food products, adding the nation's number one brand in bagels ... offers substantial new opportunities to grow our business,\" he said in a statement.\nAnalysts said the deal would extend Kellogg's reach into America's breakfast pantry by moving it into the fast-growing bagel business, with sales estimated at about $2.8 billion a year.\nIn addition to being the world's largest maker of ready-to-eat breakfast cereal, Kellogg also makes Pop-Tarts toaster pastries, Eggo frozen waffles and Nutri-Grain breakfast bars.\n\"It's a good fit in that it is a breakfast business,\" said Salomon Brothers analyst Nomi Ghez. \"It recognises that the cereal market has matured, and other areas are eating into it. They have to move into those other areas.\"\nThe deal, expected to close by year-end, includes Lender's plants in New Haven, Conn.; Mattoon, Ill., and Buffalo, N.Y., Kellogg said.\nBut the acquisition is not big enough to halt the erosion in Kellogg's mainstay cereal business, analysts said. Price cuts of about 19 percent this year have failed to boost demand, and Kellogg's cereal sales fell as much as 15 percent in the third quarter due to stiff competition, they said.\nStandard &amp; Poor's Corp. Monday cut its ratings outlook for $1.3 billion in Kellogg corporate debt to negative from stable because it believes the company will have difficulty in recapturing lost sales and improving profits.\nKellogg's earlier this month warned that its first quarter 1997 profits will likely fall below the year-earlier results.\nKellogg stock fell 12.5 cents to $68.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAt a price of more than 1.5 times Lender's sales, the acquisition will depress Kellogg's earnings slightly in 1997, Ghez estimated. It should boost profits in 1998, she said.\nJoseph Stewart, Kellogg's senior vice president of corporate affairs, said the company sees long-term growth prospects for Lender's Bagels, which has 45 percent of the nation's prepackaged bagel market.\n\"This is a long-term positive proposition to build shareholder value,\" Stewart said.\nKraft, based in Northfield, Ill., is the nation's largest packaged food company with revenues of $16 billion.\nKellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., has annual sales of about $7 billion.\n", "China's economic tsar has called for tougher controls on financial risk to protect the nation's banking system and set strict guidelines for trimming its huge pile of bad debt.\nVice Premier Zhu Rongji said state banks, struggling with loans they may never recover, needed to cut bad debt by two percent a year or their top managers could be sacked, the official People's Daily said on Thursday.\n\"The financial system must make a major push in 1997 to restore financial order and reduce risk,\" Zhu told delegates to the nation's parliament.\n\"We must seek to reduce the rate of bad loans by two percent annually over the next few years,\" he said. \"We will hold accountable the leaders of those banks that cannot meet the standards.\"\nZhu, former head of the central bank, has been pushing to insulate banks from speculative investments in real estate as well as the nation's volatile stock and futures markets.\nHe has ordered banks to divorce themselves from trust company subsidiaries that can invest in more speculative markets.\nHe has also pushed hard for banks to extend loans based on the creditworthiness of their customers.\nMany local governments pressure state banks to lend money to key enterprises that are major employers -- even when they are unlikely to repay.\nZhu reminded government officials that the commercial bank law bars local governments from interfering in bank operations.\nCentral bank officials have said as much as 13-14 percent of all loans extended by state-run banks were non-performing.\nSome big banks might be insolvent if their bad loans were written off, financial analysts say.\nIn January, China announced it had shut the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC), major trust firm, for unspecified irregularities.\nOn Thursday, official newspapers reported that the state would stand behind the debts of CADTIC, repaying principal though it would not pay interest.\n", "Britain's third-largest drugs company Zeneca Group Plc said on Tuesday that it broke a string of records in 1996, with sales topping five billion pounds ($8 billion) and profits surging above one billion pounds for the first time.\nPre-tax profits before exceptional charges rose 15 percent to 1.01 billion pounds, beating the most optimistic analysts' forecasts.

However the stock, which has risen by around 40 percent in the past 12 months, was trading down 16-1/2 pence at 18.86 pounds later as analysts pondered their meeting with the group's management.\nChief executive David Barnes told Reuters the results showed the company was \"in touch with\" his ambitious target of doubling profits by the end of the century, but warned that spending on new products would restrain profits in the short term.\nLast year Barnes set what he called \"an inspirational target\" of increasing earnings per share (eps) by an average of 15 percent between 1996 and 2000. Before exceptional items, eps rose 14 percent last year to a record 70.6 pence, and after exceptionals jumped by 90 percent to 67.8 pence.\nThe group's 13 percent rise in drug sales to 2.44 billion pounds dwarfed the six percent sales growth announced last week by its bigger rival Glaxo Wellcome Plc.

Profits at the slimmed-down specialty chemicals arm also rose strongly, up 25 percent at 70 million pounds.\nBarnes said Zeneca had a raft of new drugs and agrochemicals which \"should be significant products by the time we come to 2001,\" when Zestril loses its patent protection.\nHe said Zeneca had won its highest ever number of new drug approvals last year, and announced that a new migraine drug, Zomig, won its first approval wordlwide in Britain on Monday.\nBarnes said other promising products included the novel mild asthma tablet Accolate, which Zeneca said had sales of eight million pounds in its first few weeks of launch, schizophrenia treatment Seroquel and the fungicide Amistar.\nThe company expects its capital spending to rise above the 400 million pound level this year as it gears up for new production, while research and development spending is seen rising around 10 percent after topping 600 million pounds in 1996.\n\"In 1996 we essentially, through increased capital expenditure and R&amp;D, invested one billion pounds in the medium and long-term of the business, while making record profits of a billion pounds, generating cash and having an ungeared balance sheet,\" he told Reuters.\nBarnes, whose contract as chief executive expires in 15 months time, would not rule out using the group's debt-free balance sheet to make a major acquisition.\n\"We are very alive to new product opportunities. We are alive to regional infill opportunities if they were to strengthen our business.

The overall 1995 deficit was 95.7 billion crowns.\nThe CSU said in a statement that imports for 1996, spurred by constant growth of machinery imports, totalled 755.3 billion crowns, a year-on-year rise of 12.7 percent.\nMeanwhile, the CSU said exports faltered, hampered in part by a downturn in western European economies and a strengthening crown, rising only 3.5 percent year-on-year to total 594.95 billion crowns in 1996.\nThe CSU added that machinery imports alone for the year hit 288.5 billion crowns, an increase of 16.1 percent over 1995.\nRaw materials, unprocessed goods and chemical products imports also showed strong growth, totalling 327.9 billion crowns, a 10.2 percent year-on-year increase.\nThe same sector also dominated exports, reaching 280.6 billion crowns. But the CSU said exports in this area contracted by some 4.2 percent year-on-year.\nDespite the poorer than expected result for December, analysts said the overall figure should have little impact on the crown after some nervous moments in early Monday trading.\n\"It's quite nervous, spreads are wide...(but) bad figures were expected and the figures are not seasonally adjusted,\" said Petr Tomek of Zivnostenska Banka.\nThe crown dipped to around 27.888 against the dollar and 17.057 against the mark implying +4.07 percent against its mark/dollar basket mid-point immediately after the figures were released, but it subsequently recovered to around +4.2 percent.\nThe crown was fixed on Friday by the central bank at 4.4 percent above the basket mid-point.

It's time to pay the shareholders for their patience,\" said CS First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas. \"They want to hand some cash back to shareholders who have been long waiting on the suffering side.\"\nGM spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said GM was scheduled to consider its dividend at the board meeting, but would not comment on a possible increase or stock buyback programme.\nThe automaker could have afforded such a move last fall, but analysts said it did not want a big payoff to shareholders throwing a wrench into tense contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union.\nAnalysts estimated that the board, which holds its regularly scheduled board meeting for February on Monday, will increase the quarterly dividend by 10 cents to 20 cents a share and announce $2 billion to $3 billion in stock repurchases this year. GM now pays a quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share.\nColas said his estimate that GM will buyback $3 billion worth of stock this year was based on expectations that GM ended 1996 with $15 billion in cash, $3 billion above its target of $12 billion.\nHe noted that Chrysler, less than a third of GM's size, plans to repurchase $2 billion worth of shares in 1997. Chrysler's buyback programme has put a floor under the automaker's stock, allowing it to outperform its rivals.\nSmith Barney analyst David Garrity said the board could authorise as much as $5 billion in repurchases over a longer period of time.\nGM's dividend hike will be aimed at improving the automakers dividend yield to competitive levels, analysts said. It now is at 2.59 percent, compared with 4.56 percent for Ford and 4.57 percent for Chrysler.\nA regular share repurchase programme also would lend stability to GM's share price and help it sustain its recent gains, analysts say.\nIn the past month alone, GM shares have risen about 15 percent, from about $55 a share, largely on anticipation of the Hughes deal, news that it settled its industrial espionage dispute with Volkswagen AG and expectations of strong cash flow.\n\"They've packed an awful lot of good news into a short period of time,\" Bear Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Nicholas Lobaccaro said. \"They've accomplished the goal of getting the stock price up, and now the challenge is to sustain it. That can only get done through consistent earnings for several quarters.\"\nThe euphoria over the Hughes deal has overshadowed GM's fourth quarter earnings, which are expected to show the ravages of lower production due to strikes and model launches.\nGM has said U.S. and Canadian strikes in October and November reduced its fourth quarter results by $700 million. The automaker also is taking a $170 million charge for lump-sum payments associated with its new United Auto Workers contract.\nAccording to consensus Wall Street estimates, GM on Tuesday is expected to post fourth quarter earnings of about $385 million, or 51 cents a share, which excludes the $170 million charge.\nIn the fourth quarter of 1995, GM earned a record $1.9 billion, or $1.98 a share, a figure helped by about $577 million worth of tax benefits.\n", "Business demands for cheaper telephone services will propel liberalisation in the telecommunications markets of the APEC region, a U.S. telecommunications official said on Friday.\nLarry Irving, a telecommunications adviser to U.S. President Bill Clinton, said the biggest advocates of change of telecommunications law were business leaders looking for better service and lower prices.\n\"The biggest proponent is not the telecom companies it is the industrialists, who are demanding better services and cheaper prices,\" said Irving, who is head administrator of the National Telecommunication Informational Agency (NTIA).\n\"It is becoming a competitive edge, countries cannot afford not to liberalise their telecom markets,\" Irving told Reuters at a meeting of APEC telecommunications ministers in Australia.\nCountries that liberalise telecommunications markets would create more telecom-related jobs than those retaining state-owned monopolies, he said, citing Chile, Mexico and New Zealand as APEC countries with open telecommunications markets.\nIrving said 400,000 jobs were created in the United States last year in telecommunications and information technology industry or about one-fifth of all new jobs in the U.S. economy.\nChile's Undersecretary of Communications Gregorio San Martin Ricci said more jobs have been created in his country's telecommunications industry since the South American nation deregulated the market in the late 1980s.\n\"There are now nine companies providing local telephone services and six firms provide long distance calls, compared with two companies in the late 1980s, which has meant more jobs,\" San Martin told Reuters in an interview.\nA deregulated telecommunications market has also made Chile more internationally competitive, the Chilean minister said on the last day of the three-day meeting of ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).\n\"Before our markets used to be so far away, because we are right down the bottom of South America, but with good telecommunications our customers are now very close and distance is no longer a problem,\" San Martin said.\nFellow Latin American delegate, Carlos Mier Y Tieran, director general of Mexico's telecommunications department, said his nation also took steps in the 1980s to deregulate its telecommunications market in order to become more competitive.\n\"There is no question that it has made us more competitive, but we realised we had to open it to private investment because we could not afford to do it ourselves,\" Mier Y Tieran said in an interview.\nMier Y Tieran said about US$11 billion had been invested in Mexico's telecommunications market over the past six years.\n\"In many ways Mexico has a geographical advantage, we are a neighbour to the biggest market in the world, the United States, we are part of APEC on the Pacific coast and Europe on the

jail.\nThe SFA started proceedings against nine former senior executives of Barings but did not proceed against Peter Baring and Andrew Tuckey, chairman and deputy chairman respectively of Barings group.\nThe nine were former chief executive Peter Norris, Ron Baker, Bax, Geoff Broadhust, Tony Gamby, Tony Hawes, Ian Hopkins, George Maclean and Mary Walz.\nOf these nine, only Hopkins and Baker have any outstanding business with the SFA.\nAfter its spectacular collapse, Barings was taken over by Dutch financial services group Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV and now operates as ING

British company for up to 15 years.\nThe DTI said it would hold preliminary hearings and then would set a timetable for a final hearing of the cases.\nAnd as if that wasn't enough, Norris, Tuckey, Baker, Walz, Hopkins, Gamby, Broadhurst and Bax also face writs from accountancy firm Cooper's &amp; Lybrand in third party proceedings after it was sued by Barings administrator Ernst &amp; Young for

Sales were up 2.2 percent at 36.27 billion.\nThe return to the black was mainly due to the sale of Thomson-CSF's 19 percent stake in the troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.\n\"Thomson-CSF has been able to return to a profitable footing, as the bank no longer weighs on the accounts of the company, which is now completely centred on defence electronics,\" chairman Marcel Roulet told an analysts' meeting.\nThe state, after a bungled first attempt, is trying to privatise Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring which may have an impact on the entire European sector.\nRoulet said he expected the terms and conditions drawn up by the government on the privatisation would be published soon. \"It is a question of a few days or a week.\" The Privatisation Commission has to vet the terms to allow the sale to go ahead.\nFrench engineering and telecommunications giant Alcatel Alsthom has teamed up with fighter-aircraft maker Dassault Aviation and state-owned Aerospatiale to bid for Thomson-CSF.\nMissiles-to-publishing group Lagardere is also bidding, supported by British Aerospace Plc (BAe) .\nThomson-CSF said in a statement that operating profit rose 5.6 percent to 2.07 billion francs despite a reduction in military budgets and tougher markets. The improvement was due to better competitiveness following restructuring efforts pursued over a number of years.\nThe net result was dented by an exceptional charge of 824 million francs, compared with 753 million in the prior year, to cover restructuring costs tied to the shrinking of markets and cost-cutting measures, it said.\nPre-tax pre-exceptional profit rose 12 percent to 2.04 billion francs, reflecting the productivity gains and lower financial charges. Financial costs fell to 27 million francs from 135 million, due to lower interest rates and favourable currency movements.\nConsolidated pretax profit was 1.30 billion francs, versus a loss of 437 million, which included a 101 million franc hit from its the sale of its holding in Credit Lyonnais.\nThe previous three years' losses at Thomson-CSF were essentially due to falls in the value of Credit Lyonnais shares, which were taken on Thomson-CSF's accounts to reflect its equity stake.\n", "Tomkins Plc, the UK conglomerate with businesses spanning baking to engineering, is expected to sees a rise in half year pretax profits on Monday amid some market speculation that it could announce a share buyback.\nAnalysts were mostly predicting six month profits of around 160 million stg from 126.1 million in the previous year. The average forecast for the half year payout was 3.0 pence per share from 2.70 pence last time.  \nThe shares have recently seen brisk gains following a \"buy\" recommendation from Kleinwort Benson analysts. Tomkins was also listed as one of the nine stocks to buy in 1997 by Credit Lyonnais Laing. Shares are currently at 278 pence, down two pence.\nAnother reason for Tomkins' recent gains has been some market speculation about a possible share buyback. The group board obtained permission for a buyback of up to 10 percent of its shares in 1995 and currently has around 400 million stg in cash.  \nBut Ian Rennardson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said the group had given no indications since that it may launch a buyback at the interim stage. Other analysts are also sceptical.\nRennardson sees interim profits at 160 million stg and expects a solid trading performance. \"This is a stock within a sector which has seen real underperformance. Tomkins has the best earnings, dividends and cashflow and after the Gates (Corp) deal, the shares are still looking reasonably cheap.\"\nAnother analyst, predicting the same profit levels, said investors would be looking for an update on Gates since its acquisition last summer for $1 bln.  \nGates is an automotive and components company.\nSterling is not expected to deal a blow to the Tomkins results this time round, said one analyst.  \"Sterling will in fact benefit the year ending April 1997 as Tomkins has locked in (foreign exchange cover) at $1.52 to the pound,\" he said.\nHe anticipates a solid U.S. performance, with a slightly subdued UK market and continued good cash generation.\n--London newsroom +44 171 5427717\n", "U.S. investigators began the grim task on Friday of digging through a snow-covered field to recover the bodies of 29 people killed on Thursday when a commuter plane crashed during a snowstorm near Detroit.\nOfficials said National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators would focus on retrieving bodies before looking at the wreckage of the Delta Comair plane.\n\"We're going to be doing the body recovery first, and the NTSB investigation secondly,\" Monroe County Sheriff Tilman Crutchfield told a news conference in Monroe, a town about six miles (10 km) from the crash site.\nHe added that NTSB officials briefly examined the site on Thursday night but had not located the plane's cockpit voice and data recorders.\nThe Comair plane, an Embraer Brasilia 120 en route to Detroit from Cincinnati, crashed in a snowy field just west of Monroe in Raisinville Township, Mich., about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Detroit.\nThose killed included a teacher from Englewood, Colorado, who was en route to Detroit to attend a memorial service for her brother who died on December 22 in another air crash,\nA temporary morgue has been set up at the Custer Airport near Monroe and NTSB officials were expected to be at the crash site by mid-morning.\nWreckage from the crash was strewn over a tight area of about 200 yards (190 metres) by 100 yards (94 metres), Tilman said.

Earlier, the shares traded as low as $8.75.\nThe company blamed weak sales on an \"over-emphasis\" of marketing on a new, jazzy version of its flagship database software product, at the expense of neglecting its proven line of existing products.\n\"We were literally enamoured with our technology lead and we took our eyes off the core business,\" said Phil White, Informix chief executive, in a conference call with investors.\nInformix writes computer programmes, called databases, that let big companies store and retrieve huge amounts of vital information, such as customer names and inventory lists.\nIn December, Informix introduced Universal Server, a database that can not only store text and numbers like a traditional database, but also video, sound, photographs, maps and other non-traditional types of data.\nInformix executives last year bet that there would be huge demand for a database that could store media, as companies rushed to set up elaborate sites on the World Wide Web. They also expected existing customers to upgrade quickly to the new database.\nThings will take much longer than Informix planned, analysts said.\n\"Universal Server is cool technology, but people don't go out to buy technology,\" said David Rothschild, managing director of brokerage Piper Jaffrey in Minneapolis. They buy proven products to help them manage vital records, he said.\n\"It's a classic product transition,\" said Charles Phillips, software analyst at investment bank Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. \"They're trying to sell a new product before it's ready to be sold and they're not concentrating on the old product.\"\nAlso, Informix seems to be losing ground to Oracle Corp., the biggest vendor of database software.\nOracle, too, is pitching a new generation of database software.

Soccer should only profit from it,\" Vacek said.\nBut patience is running short after the German firm UFA, which holds the rights to televise Czech World Cup qualifying games, put a $1 million price tag on the team's away games, a move which meant that Czech viewers missed the first live broadcast of a key national team game in 21 years.\nIt ended in a 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia but, even so, the complaints from disappointed fans were heard up and down the country.\n\"This would never have happened under communism.

(ESM), said Leslie Vadasz, Intel senior vice president and director of corporate business development.\n\"Europe has a lot of satellite use, so it was an obvious place,\" to begin such a service, Vadasz told Reuters. \"There is a need to provide a new kind of service for PC users.\"\nIndustry sources valued the Intel investment at $15 million, with Luxenbourg's Societe Europeenne des Satellite (SES) holding a majority stake in the new company, which will also be based in Luxenbourg.\nIntel executives declined to comment on the cash value of the deal, but said the company would also be contributing technology to the endeavor, and hopes to bring in partners capable of supplying multimedia content to the venture.\n\"Part of our contribution will be technology. Part of it will be our relationship with many of our customers, content and media companies,\" Vadasz said in an interview.\nOther investors are expected to be announced in the near future, he said.

The first business-to-business communications links will be operational in the second half of this year.\nESM is expected to eventually bring PC services to European homes much as increasingly popular satellite television services, like BSkyB, have done for TV.\nIntel noted that more than 16 million personal computers bought in Europe last year, according to the research firm Dataquest, and 23 million European households have direct access to ASTRA satellite transmissions.\nASTRA-NET reception throughout Europe will require 50-60 centimeter satellite dish, less than two feet in diameter, connected to a PC equipped with a high-performance Intel Pentium microprocessor and a PC card which is compatible with Europe's Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) transmissions.\nIntel said business data can be sent to servers at speeds up to 38 megabits per second, well above the 56 kilobit speeds of leading-edge telephone modems or the 128 kilobits per second rates of Integrated Digital Services Network (ISDN).\nSpeeds of six megabits per second to the home will be possible, with technology likely to be available by the year 2000 which could enable two-way satellite traffic.\nAt first, traffic will be broadcast-only, however, with the capcity to send data and multimedia programming at speeds hundreds of times faster than over conventional phones.\n\"As satellite technology moves along, there's be more and more opportunity to do an on-demand type of service,\" such as higher-speed Internet browsing. \"Initially, this will be a push technology only.\"\nVadasz said Intel's work on developing technology for cable modems and on Ethernet local area network (LAN) adapters can be brought to bear in the project. Intel also has been working on a wireless data standard dubbed Intercast.\nVadasz has argued that PC communications have lagged wellbehind other technologies, stating in a recent editorial letter to the San Jose Mercury News that such services could result in more than $10 billion in annual U.S. sales alone.\nTo foster such a market, he wrote, higher bandwidth connections with instant access, multimedia integration, security and affordable pricing were necessary features.\n((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))\n", "China's role as an important world trading partner is a legacy of reformist leader Deng Xiaoping, but the hard task of fully opening the country's food markets remains, diplomats and analysts said on Monday.\nAs U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in Beijing declaring it her mission to draw China into the international fold, the sources said that on agricultural trade, China still had a long row to hoe.\nRestrictions on trade in grain and other agricultural products have often been seen by trading partners, especially Washington, as political barriers to a more open Chinese market.\nQuarantine issues loom large in Sino-U.S. trade, with U.S. grain officials saying, for instance, that Chinese restrictions aimed at keeping out a fungus called TCK smut deny the United States of annual wheat sales worth up to $500 million.\nA high-ranking U.S. diplomatic source in Beijing said talks on this and similar issues appeared to be making progress.\nThe hard part, he said, would be prying open the state-controlled grain trade.\n\"The hard work is going to be state trading monopolies,\" he said.\n\"Allowing access to the market, getting away from restrictive licensing and quotas, allowing others to participate in trade, allowing the Cargills and the Continentals to import and distribute on their own account -- all this remains to be done.\"\nThe senior representative in Asia of a major U.S. grain trading house agreed, but said progress was a long way off.\n\"It is something we have been campaigning for for a long time...that China's import markets and domestic distribution of grains and grain-related products should be open to foreign participation,\" he told Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\"I don't know that we have any great hope that there will be changes in the short term,\" he said.\nHe and other sources in Asia said Chinese authorities were beginning to face the fact that grain imports would always be necessary and that it would be acceptable if China could supply 85 to 90 percent of its own grain needs.\nTotal grain output in 1996 was a record 480 million tonnes, with a state-set target of 500 million tonnes by 2000. Total grain imports for 1996 were 12 million tonnes, down 42 percent on the previous year.\nThe diplomat said China's cotton industry has slowly been eased into the world at large as authorities realised it is cheaper to import than pay Chinese farmers prices that are higher than those on world markets.\n\"One of the arguments we keep making is that when you continue to force people to produce at high prices, it fuels inflation,\" the diplomat in Beijing said.\nDeng Xiaoping's forward-looking reform policies recognised that \"no nation is an island\", another trading source said.\nHigh tariffs as well as licencing and quota systems had been relaxed on intermediate commodities such as vegetable oil and high-value products such as apples from the U.S. state of Washington.\nWhile movements on China's entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) did signal some hope that Beijing will open its markets, trading and diplomatic sources were not sure any changes would take place in the near term.\n\"It is our big hope that somehow WTO will provide the leverage for this to happen, but it is not the universal panacea,\" the trading house representative said.\n\"It is an evolutionary process, not a revolutionary one.\"\n", "Promising trial results published on Wednesday on a new drug for treating Hepatitis B have raised hopes that Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc may have another big seller on its hands.\nThe pharmaceuticals giant, whose best-selling ulcer drug Zantac is expected to be eaten up by generic competition later this year, said advanced studies showed that Lamivudine may reduce and even reverse damage to the liver caused by the Hepatitis B virus.\nShares in Glaxo Wellcome, which licensed Lamivudine from Canada's BioChem Pharma Inc in 1990, climbed 23 1/2 pence to 11.13 pounds ($18.04) in early afternoon trading.\nLamivudine is also the base for Glaxo Wellcome's increasingly successful AIDS drug Epivir. But analysts said questions remained about how effective Lamivudine would be with Hepatitis B, with detailed results from several other studies not expected until the end of the year.\nHowever, any advance would be a breakthrough against a virus which doctors say is 100 times more infectious than AIDS and kills two million people every year.\nThe World Health Organisation estimates that 350 million people carry the virus worldwide. Passed on in a variety of ways including unprotected sex, drug use, contact sports and from mother to baby, it can lead to severe liver scarring and is responsible for 80 percent of cases of liver cancer.\nIn a ground-breaking move Glaxo Wellcome plans to file its first regulatory approval for the drug in Asia later this year rather than in Europe or the United States, reflecting the prevalence of Hepatitis B in the region.\nGlaxo Wellcome told the European Association for the Study of the Liver on Wednesday that phase III tests of Lamivudine on 358 people with chronic Hepatitis B in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong were \"extremely encouraging\".\nIt said 67 percent of patients who took a 100 milligram Lamivudine tablet every day for a year saw the condition of their liver improve compared with 30 percent who took a placebo. The number of people whose liver deteriorated was greatly reduced.\nIt also found that 16 percent of people taking the drug managed to stop the Hepatitis B virus from replicating in the blood compared with four percent who took a placebo.\nMore than 95 percent of Hepatitis B cases are estimated to be in the developing world. Authorities in China said last year that 120 million Chinese were affected by the condition and about 40 percent of these were pregnant women. Glaxo Wellcome said it had already held talks with the Chinese government on making the drug available there.\nA spokesman said Lamivudine would also fit in with the group's strategy of becoming more focused on different regions, partly in recognition of the huge growth potential for pharmaceuticals and health care in regions such as Asia and South America.\nBut analysts said Lamivudine's focus on poorer countries made the issue of pricing the drug difficult to predict. It also raised the question of creating different pricing policies for rich and poor countries, a controversial move which Glaxo Wellcome is known to want to explore.\nOne analyst said sales estimates ranged from a couple of hundred million pounds a year to a billion pounds, reflecting uncertainty about how the drug will be marketed.\n\"From a scientific point of view this is a very exciting prospect (but) in commercial terms there remain questions on its sales prospects,\" he said.\nSocGen analyst Alyson Coates said she had cautiously estimated sales of 150 million pounds for the drug by the year 2000 and peak sales of 350 million pounds a year.\nBut she said questions remained about whether Lamivudine would be more effective when taken together with other drugs, just as Epivir works better in combination, and on how resistant the virus might be to the drug in some people.\nGlaxo Wellcome is one of a number of companies working on products for Hepatitis B.\nSmithKline Beecham Plc is developing a version of its herpes treatment Famvir, and Germany's Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Vion Pharmaceuticals Inc and Gilead Sciences Inc of the United States and Britain's Medeva Plc also have products in clinical trials.

By 1999, First Bank sees about an 8 percent addition to earnings per share.\nFirst Bank said it would be able to increase revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp's extensive corporate base.\nHome equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp's customers, while U.S. Bancorp's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers, the banks said.\n\"Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines,\" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group.\nGrundhofer will be president and chief executive of the new company, which will take the U.S. Bancorp name but remain based in Minneapolis.\nU.S. Bancorp Chairman Gerry Cameron will serve as chairman of the merged bank until his retirement in 1998.\nSince 1991, First Bank has made 23 acquisitions, including the $717 million acquisition of Nebraska-based FirsTier Financial Inc. in 1996.\n", "Government officials flew to northern Colombia on Friday in a bid to persuade prisoners to lay down their weapons and release hostages seized in a bloody jail riot, which left four guards confirmed dead.\nA crack anti-kidnap force, meanwhile, took up positions around the jail and a local police chief raised the possibility of launching a lightning operation to rescue the hostages.\nA group of 10 hardened convicts heading the revolt refused to budge on earlier demands for two helicopters to airlift them out of the jail in Valledupar, in Cesar province, and take them to an undisclosed location, the city mayor said.\nAt least one of the men, a former leader of the now-defunct M-19 leftist rebel movement, called for political asylum in Cuba.\n\"I would urge the prisoners to be patient and avoid any further bloodshed. We are on our way to the jail (from Bogota) and want to look for a peaceful solution to this grave problem,\" said government human rights ombudsman Jose Fernando Castro, who is heading the mediation team.\nAbout 550 inmates went on a rampage on Thursday evening and seized control of the jail after overpowering 18 guards and confiscating their pistols and nightsticks. Police said leftist guerrillas and four former policemen jailed for kidnapping and extortion are heading the disturbance.\nA spokeswoman for the National Prisons Institute originally said five guards were reported killed in the shoot-out and a handful of convicts had been injured. By Friday morning, Valledupar mayor Tito Pumarejo confirmed that four bodies, all prison guards, had been ferried out of the jail compound by Red Cross workers.\nThe INPEC spokeswoman said the final death toll may be higher, adding that security forces were still unable to enter the jail.\nA Valledupar police commander, Col. Alvaro Becerra, said about 100 police and troops had formed three security cordons around the jail and said there was a \"tense but calm stand-off.\"\n\"It would be difficult to mount an operation to rescue the hostages. It would require a great deal of planning. But an elite GAULA (anti-kidnap) squad is in place and a combined police and army strike is a possibility,\" he told Reuters by phone.\n\"But the inmates' demands are absolutely absurd and I don't think they will be granted,\" he added.\nThe inmates are holding at least 15 hostages, including a 14-year-old girl who was visiting the jail when the riot erupted, and the prison's deputy director. The majority of the prisoners restricted their demands to an end to overcrowding and better conditions.\nThe riot in Valledupar jail, built for 200 inmates and not the current 550 it houses, is the latest in a series of disturbances in Colombian jails.\nThree provincial prisons were rocked by riots earlier this year. In the last 10 days, 2,000 inmates, led by convicted guerrillas, smashed part of Bogota's La Modelo jail while an inmate died in Bogota's top-security La Picota facility when a bomb he was making in his cell accidentally exploded.\nChronic overcrowding is broadly considered to be the main cause of the riots. More than 40,000 prisoners are crammed into facilities designed for 30,000 people, the INPEC spokeswoman said.\n", "Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) watchdog said on Wednesday it had every confidence in its decision to award three key licences to run digital terrestrial television despite a possible legal challenge.\nDigital Television Network (DTN), which is owned by American cable and broadcasting group NTL Inc, says it might seek legal redress and challenge the ITC's decision on Tuesday to award the licences to its rival British Digital Broadcasting (BDB) consortium.\nBut an ITC spokeswoman said: \"We are always ready to defend our decisions in a judicial review. But this is really a matter for DTN to decide.\"\nBDB is jointly owned by Britain's biggest commercial television groups, Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc. Pay-TV giant British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc will be the main programme supplier.\nThe ITC conceded that DTN's programme plans for the digital era were more innovative than those of BDB. But they tended to appeal more to a niche audience than BDB's suggested diet of mainly popular Sky movies and sport.\nThe ITC emphasised that there were other criteria in choosing a winner, such as ensuring the success and promotion of digital terrestrial TV.\n\"Taking all the criteria as a whole, BDB had the stronger package,\" a spokeswoman said.\nDigital terrestrial television, which is likely to be launched in Britain next year, will allow customers to receive up to 30 channels broadcast from conventional transmitters to domestic aerials.\nBSkyB, which has enjoyed a near-monopoly position in the British subscription television market, supplies popular sports and movies to both cable and satellite services. It also plans to launch 200-channel digital satellite services next year.\nAnalysts and lawyers contacted on Wednesday thought  any attempt to seek legal redress would have at best a slim chance of success.\n\"I think on balance I wouldn't expect this to succeed,\" said one corporate lawyer. \"But any litigation is pretty unpredictable. The weakness in any case is that the ITC has clearly appreciated the difficulty and taken steps as they have seen it to meet that.\"\nThe ITC has asked BSkyB to drop its plans to take a 33 percent BDB stake -- which Carlton and Granada are now buying for 75 million pounds ($125.1 million) -- on competition grounds.\nDTN, meanwhile, is still seeking legal advice.\n\"We're still considering our options ranging from doing nothing at all to...either a judicial review or discussions with other bodies. We haven't come down in any way on any decision,\" a spokesman said.\nBut he welcomed the advice given to the ITC by the telecommunications watchdog, Oftel, that awarding the licences to BDB might be anti-competitive.\nOftel director general Don Cruickshank had warned the ITC that allowing BSkyB to be either an equity partner or a long-term supplier of pay-TV programmes raised \"substantial competition concerns\".\nIn the meantime, Oftel is inviting views from all interest parties on its general competition analysis so it can use the comments in other cases.\n\"The way we are analysing the effects of one adjacent market on another is of extreme relevance to the markets we regulate,\" a spokeswoman said.\nShe added that the decision to award the licences to BDB despite Oftel's advice was a matter for the ITC.\n\"We're bound to look at competition issues but they look at much wider issues,\" she said. \"We can give our advice -- but that's as far as we go.\" ($ = 0.599 British Pounds)\n", "Canada's Philip Environmental Inc. said on Thursday it planned to acquire Houston-based Allwaste Inc. and Serv-Tech Inc. in two deals worth $612 million that would create North America's biggest recycling firm.\n\"We are naturally very, very excited about this opportunity,\" Philip Chief Executive Allen Fracassi told a media conference call. \"It makes great economic sense and the synergies are just spectacular.\"\nHamilton, Ontario-based Philip said that the deals when completed in June would create North America's largest metals recycling and industrial services company, with annual revenues topping $1.6 billion, 8,000 employees and 215 operating locations in North America, Europe and South America.\nPhilip, which has recently made a spate of acquisitions to expand beyond the metals recycling business, said it would swap 0.611 of a Philip share for each Allwaste share for total consideration of $540 million.\nThe deal included the assumption of about $133 million in debt from Allwaste, which provides industrial services.\nIn a separate transaction, Philip agreed to exchange 0.403 of a Philip share for each Serv-Tech share in a deal valued at $72 million, including the assumption of $21 million of debt.\nIndustrial and environmental services firm Serv-Tech generated more than $140 million in revenues in 1996 and Philip said that its earnings would be boosted by the Serv-Tech deal.\nFracassi told reporters that Philip was not done with acquisitions.\n\"Our acquisition program will continue. We are in an very very quickly consolidating, fairly new industrial sector, so we'll continue to seek and react to opportunities,\" he said.\nAnalyst Peter von Ond at Canadian brokerage Midland Walwyn called the deals a good fit.\nVon Ond said he revised his 1998 earnings estimate for Philip to C$1.70 ($1.25) a share from C$1.60 ($1.17) after the news.\nHis 1997 forecast was unchanged at C$1.40 ($1.03) a share since the deals do not close until late June and more Philips shares will be issued, offsetting earnings growth.\nPhilip earned C71 cents (52 cents) a share in 1996.\nShares of Philip were down C50 cents to C$22 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday and by 25 cents to $16.125 in New York.\nAllWaste rose $2.50 to $9.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Serv-Tech rose 81.25 cents to $5.875 on Nasdaq.\n", "The stock of International Business Machines Corp fell in heavy trading on Thursday, hit by renewed fears about its first-quarter earnings after a published report focused on recent analysts' estimate cuts.\nThe sell-off fueled the overall stock market's fourth sharp sell-off in five days as investors were already scared that Friday's March employment report, if robust, could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again soon.\nIBM fell as low as $128.875 before ending down $2.375 at $131.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the third most-active issue on volume of 4.6 million shares.\nIBM shares began their tumble in London, where investors first read a Wall Street Journal article that said analysts may not be through cutting IBM's earnings estimates.\nThe report talked about a recent spate of analysts' estimate cuts, citing fears that a stronger dollar and a mainframe product transition will hurt IBM's first-quarter earnings, due April 23, and depress the stock even further. A strong dollar makes sales overseas worth less in dollar terms.\nAs previously reported, two weeks ago three Wall Street firms made negative comments and two lowered their estimates on IBM, fueling a drop in IBM's shares in late March.\nThe report, which appeared as a \"Heard on the Street\" column in Thursday's Journal, also dredged up an almost two-week old rumor that IBM was going to pre-announce that its earnings would come in below analysts' estimates.\n\"The Wall Street Journal article today is a summation of old news,\" said John Jones of Salomon Brothers. \"We talked to IBM today and they have no plans for a pre-announcement.\"\nOne trader said of the newspaper article: \"They are a bit late to the party here.\"\n\"I heard the rumor but I wouldn't put any credence to it,\" said another trader.\nAn IBM spokesman declined to comment on the quarter.\nAs previously reported, on March 21, Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich cut IBM's 1997 earnings estimate to $12.30 a share from $12.50. For all of 1996, IBM earned $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share.\nOn March 20, Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Jay Stevens lowered his first-half earnings estimates for IBM, saying customers might hold off purchases of mainframes until an anticipated upgrade. Some analysts are expecting initial shipments in June.\nStevens added to his estimates for the second half of the year, however, saying the year would be more back-end loaded, as customers make purchases in the second half of the year.\nAlso in March, Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh said it would be tough for IBM's first-quarter earnings, which it estimated at $2.32 a share, to compare to the year-ago period's. The analysts' consensus estimate is $2.31 a share for the first quarter, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.\nFor the first quarter of 1996, IBM posted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $2.48 a share, excluding charges associated with software acquisitions and other special items.\nGary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst, said he is maintaining his first-quarter earnings estimate of $2.32 a share, which he has had since February.\n\"It's going to be tough to make that number and I doubt that they can overachieve it,\" Helmig said. But he added that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed drastically since February, so he sees nothing new to affect his estimates.\nThe IBM drop caused the Dow Jones industrial average to lose 39.66 points to end at 6,477.35 after an initial plunge of more than 80 points.\n", "For many in China, a fabled El Dorado lies at the southern tip of their vast country -- Hong Kong, rich and elusive.\nThe dream is likely to stay that way after the British-ruled territory reverts to Chinese rule on June 30.\nYang He, a Hong Kong resident for the past 40 years, has waited more than 11 years for his son to get a permit to come from China to join him, his wife and two daughters.\n\"We applied in 1986 for my son to come to Hong Kong.

They said they wanted at least HK$130,000 (US$16,800),\" Yang said.\n\"They told me it wasn't them who would take all the money, they have to ask favours from other people, buy cigarettes, drinks, fruit, and there wasn't such a thing as digging from their own pockets to pay my son's passage to Hong Kong.\"\nYang paid HK$40,000 (US$5,175) and a few gold rings when he applied in 1985 to get his wife and eldest daughter to join him.\nThey arrived in 1986.

But the transaction was called off after Pan Am examined the carrier's books and sought to rework the terms.\n\"We have said we will look at opportunities,\" Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kriendler said.\nHe declined to discuss any pending transactions, including one reported by the Miami Herald that Pan Am was once again in talks with Carnival Air about a merger.\nGabriel Gabor, a spokesman for privately held Carnival Air, also declined to comment on any contacts between the two companies but said Carnival Air had considered several possible deals.\n\"Over the course of 18 months, we have various talks about mergers, acquisitions and other business deals,\" Gabor said. \"But nothing is in ink.\"\nA combination of Pan Am and Carnival Air, owned by Micky Arison, chief executive of leading cruise-ship operator Carnival Corp., would create a much larger regional airline with a total of 31 jets and more than 2,200 employees. Annual revenues would be an estimated $400 million, with operations centred in south Florida.\n\"All these small airlines are trying to fill the void left by Eastern, but no one has done it yet,\" said airline industry analyst John Pincavage at Dillon Read. Eastern Airlines was long the dominant carrier in Florida until it went out of business in the early 1990s.\nPincavage said all small airlines had been hurt by the ValuJet crash in the Florida Everglades last May 11, in which 110 people died, and had a disappointing third quarter last year. Bigger rivals posted very high profits in that period, one of the strongest for airlines of the year.\nShares of Pan Am, whose namesake once had as many as 160 jets but floundered in 1991, were down $1.375 to $10 on the American Stock Exchange.\n", "Tony the Tiger is going global -- and he's adding chocolate-flavored Frosted Flakes in the United States.\nKellogg Co., the leading U.S. cereal maker, said Tuesday it will launch Frosted Flakes in the world's two most populous countries -- China and India -- and also in Thailand, starting this month.\nThis will expand international marketing for Frosted Flakes, the top-selling U.S. cereal backed by Kellogg's Tony the Tiger emblem. Frosted Flakes are already sold in markets such as Europe, Latin America, Australia and South Africa.\nBattle Creek, Mich.-based Kellogg, which accounts for about one-third of the $9 billion U.S. cereal market, also said it will begin selling a chocolate-flavored version of Frosted Flakes -- Cocoa Frosted Flakes -- in the United States next month.\nCocoa Frosted Flakes are fat-free and cholestrol-free, the company said.\nFrosted Flakes is the industry's top-selling cereal in the United States and ranks second worldwide behind Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Kellogg spokesman Anthony Hebron said.\nThe new markets for Frosted Flakes reflect Kellogg's efforts to expand its international cereal business, which has been growing at a faster rate than its U.S. operations, analysts said.\nDonaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach said he estimated Kellogg's international cereal sales grew by about 4 percent in 1996, a rate it is expected to match in 1997.\nBy contrast, Kellogg's domestic volume was down about 4 percent in 1996, Leach added.\nIn the United States, Cocoa Frosted Flakes cereal is part of Kellogg's efforts to jump-start sluggish sales and volume growth.\n\"One product by itself doesn't do it,\" Schroder Wertheim analyst Robert Cummins said of Kellogg's efforts in the United States. \"You have to have a steady stream of new products.\"\nLate last year, Kellogg launched Honey Crunch Corn Flakes, a new variety of its long-standing Corn Flakes cereal. By late 1996, Honey Crunch Corn Flakes held about a 1.2 percent market share, the company said.\nInternationally, nations like China, with a population of 1.2 billion, offer long-term sales potential for Kellogg's. But Leach cautioned the Frosted Flakes launch will not have an immediate impact on Kellogg's earnings since there is not a widely established cereal market in some nations.\n\"Cereal is a breakfast habit that is not common to all humanity,\" Leach added.\nStarting Wednesday in China, Kellogg will introduce Tony's Flakes, a reference to Frosted Flakes' Tony the Tiger.\nThe cereal will be launched in Thailand, which has a population of more than 60 million, under the name Kellogg Corn Frosties on March 25, when a new plant is expected to be opened there.\nIn India, with a population of nearly 1 billion, the product will be introduced later this year as Kellogg's Frosties.\nKellogg has been selling Corn Flakes, Rice Flakes and Wheat Flakes in China since 1995. In India, it has sold Corn Flakes, Wheat Flakes and Basmati Flakes, made from a type of rice, since 1994.\nBattle Creek, Mich.-based Kellogg also plans additional marketing support for Frosted Flakes in several countries outside the United States.\n\"Our cereal business is showing good growth in high-potential growth markets in Asia, Latin America and southern Europe,\" Hebron of Kellogg said. \"And, in more established markets like Australia, Canada and Mexico.\nKellogg stock dropped 75 cents to $68.25 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "China moved ahead on Wednesday with plans to host U.S. Vice President Al Gore, the most senior American visitor in eight years, ignoring a flap over alleged Beijing funding for the United States Democratic Party.\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman denied the funding allegations and said they would not affect this month's visit which both sides have portrayed as part of efforts to mend damaged ties.\n\"The Chinese and American sides are actively preparing for the visit,\" a ministry spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday.\nThe allegations of Chinese assistance to the Democrats were made by \"people with ulterior motives\", the spokesman said.\nThe Washington Post reported on Sunday that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation had warned six members of Congress last year that they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign contributions from foreign corporations.\nU.S. investigators had found what officials called conclusive evidence that Chinese government funds were funnelled into the United States in 1996, the newspaper said.\nChina and the United States have been hoping to use Gore's visit, scheduled for March 24-28, to help restore ties strained in recent years by a host of issues ranging from Taiwan and trade to arms and human rights.\nGore would become the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then-President George Bush toured Beijing in early 1989. That trip was marred by a flap over a U.S. decision to invite a prominent dissident to a banquet in honour of China's leaders.\nChinese and American officials have given few details of Gore's trip, though an advance team is expected in Beijing this week to make final preparations.\nThe vice president's visit is expected to pave the way for an exchange of summits between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.\nBeijing has been angered by the allegations that it made illegal contributions to the Democrats, saying it had neither the interest nor the financial ability to make such payments.\n\"We do not have the money to support U.S. political parties,\" a ministry spokesman told reporters on Tuesday.\nA U.S. congressional committee investigating campaign funding abuses has issued subpoenas to the White House and Justice Department for information on any alleged Chinese government involvement in funnelling money for the 1996 U.S. presidential election.\nA senior Chinese foreign ministry official had made serious representations to the U.S. charge d'affairs in Beijing over the accusations of illegal donations, the official Xinhua news agency said on Monday.\nClinton's Democratic Party has already returned $3 million in questionable cash to various donors, most of them with Asian ties.\nGore himself has been tarred with allegations by Republicans that he may have violated the law by pressing for contributions to the Democratic Party during the 1996 election campaign. He has insisted he broke no laws.\nClinton has used the issue to renew an appeal for reform in U.S. campaign financing laws.\nThe U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to expand its investigation of campaign fundraising abuses from just illegal actions to illegal and improper activities.\nWhile diplomats say Beijing and Washington are determined to prevent their many differences from outweighing areas of common interest, frosty exchanges have remained a frequent feature of the Sino-U.S. diplomatic dialogue.\nIn its annual report on human rights, the U.S. State Department accused Beijing of effectively silencing public dissent in 1996 through jailings, intimidation or exile.\nOn Wednesday, China's official Legal Daily repeated Beijing's response to the U.S. report, saying it had interfered in the internal affairs of other countries and had aroused objections around the world.\n", "Protesters armed with rocks, sticks and bottles clashed with police at a demonstration in Bogota's main plaza on Tuesday on the first day of a massive nationwide strike by state workers.\nTensions heightened after leftist rebels announced their support for the indefinite work stoppage, vowing to back workers' demands with force and calling for violent action.\nThe Bogota-based 13th Army Brigade said at least 42 people were arrested in and around Bogota on \"terrorist charges\" and more than 50 guns were seized as part of the army's round-up of \"agitators.\"\nUnion bosses said the strike, billed as the biggest in 20 years, had won the \"total\" support of an estimated 800,000 public sector employees and severely disrupted airports, telecommunications, oil production, government administration, and all but emergency health services. Coffee industry transport also broke down.\nRunning battles erupted in one corner of Bogota's historic Plaza Bolivar as 200 young protesters, with faces covered by scarves and bandanas, tore up chunks of pavement to hurl at police crouching behind plastic riot shields.\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries and the rioters dispersed after repeated baton charges by police. The rally of about 30,000 striking workers outside Congress broke up shortly after the violence flared.\nState workers called the strike to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike and an end to what they said was repressive labour legislation. The government, struggling to slash its fiscal deficit, has vowed to hold workers' to a weighted 13.5 percent increase. The strike began at midnight on Monday (0500 GMT on Tuesday).\n\"The strike is total. Workers have observed the call en masse and some social sectors are also joining in,\" said Hernando Hernandez, head of the oil workers' union USO, known for its combative, fiercely nationalistic stance.\nA communique issued by Cuban-inspired National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels heightened authorities' fears of imminent rebel attacks. \"We support our union comrades. But simply making demands (through a strike) is not sufficient,\" it said.\n\"These actions must go hand-in-hand with effective pressure tactics and expressions of violence and grassroots disobedience as the only method to resolve the real problems of the nation,\" the communique added.\nIt said its backing for the strike was a preamble to what it termed a \"national armed strike.\" In the past, the ELN has used so-called armed strikes to shut down vast regions of the country, blockading major highways, setting fire to vehicles and threatening people who show up for work.\nHernandez said state oil company Ecopetrol had been severely affected by the strike but a senior company official told Reuters it had no effect whatsoever since administrative employees were filling in as part of a contingency plan.\nIn the coffee industry, John Naranjo, commercial manager of the powerful National Coffee Growers' Federation, said truckers had refused to transport coffee for fear of guerrilla blockades. He said cargoes at dockside amounted to about 10 truckloads in each of the main ports -- well below average.\nState-run schools and universities across the country were shut down by the government as a security measure.\nLocal radio reports said a walk-out by airport technicians had created a heavy backlog of flights into Bogota's El Dorado international airport. Some carriers, including Continental and American Airlines, suspended operations.\n", "Russia's troubled Norilsk Nickel plant has vowed to keep output steady while it seeks a solution to its financial woes, company officials said on Thursday.\nBut the struggle to make the enterprise leaner and more competitive has forced the flagship producer to modify long-term plans to boost profitability.\nValery Alfimenko, director of the Norilsk combine's information section in Norilsk, said January output was slightly higher than planned levels but that the enterprise was not working at 100 percent of capacity.\n\"The main task is not to produce less than we did last year,\" he said. \"It will all depend on the market. If prices go up, we'll produce more; if not, less.\"\nHe said the plant's financial crisis had not affected mining operations but that supplies of materials secondary to production, like salt, could run low.\nThe Norilsk complex, Russia's biggest producer of nickel, copper and cobalt and a major world producer of platinum and palladium, is the flagship plant of the RAO Norilsky Nikel metals group.\nPlant workers have given management until February 20 to pay off three months of salary arrears and Alfimenko said a Norilsk delegation would arrive in Moscow on Sunday for more talks aimed at resolving the crisis.\nLeonid Binder, in charge of restructuring Norilsk, said output was steady but declined to give concrete figures.\n\"There are various ways of resolving the matter (financial crisis),\" he said, adding, \"Maybe we don't need to increase output, but to change the structure of our production.\" He declined to be more specific.\nPlant workers passed a vote of no-confidence in management earlier this week to protest against wage arrears of around one trillion roubles and to demand higher salaries that one official said would cost Norilsk an extra 70 billion roubles a month.\nThe crisis has meant that Norilsk, which revamped its export strategy last year in a bid to cut out intermediaries, has been unable to fully cut ties to Russian and international commodities trading houses.\n\"We try to go to the end users, but if traders offer more acceptable terms, then we go to them,\" said Marina Nefyodova, first deputy director in charge of finance at Interrosimpex, the exclusive distributor of Norilsk output. \"When financing problems exist, we choose conditions that are better for us.\"\nShe said an analysis of the effect of restructuring on exports had not yet been carried out and declined to comment on how sales volumes abroad might be affected by restructuring.\nThe task of restructuring Norilsk has fallen on commercial bank Uneximbank, which owns a 38 percent share in the group, acquired through a 1995 government shares-for-loans auction.\nWorkers have said they will ask the government to strip Uneximbank of its shares if their demands are not met. But a bank official saw no grounds to force shares to change hands.\n\"I don't see any real mechanism for them to realise this,\" said Uneximbank spokesman Modest Kolerov. \"They are upset because they want to live -- but there is no legal mechanism for them to force us to give up these shares -- we have the full right to do as we wish with these shares on the open market.\"\nThe Norilsk group is the world's second largest producer of refined nickel, and the flagship combine produced 100,000 tonnes of nickel in 1996, a company official said earlier.\nBinder said the firm faced pressing financial burdens to carry out mining, smelting and social support operations north of the Arctic Circle, where Norilsk supports entire towns.\n\"Not one metals enterprise could have carried this burden alone - the exploration, mining, production, transport of food and goods to the North,\" Binder said. \"It is a colossal burden.\"\n--Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520\n", "African coffee ministers meet on Thursday to discuss cutting robusta exports following a January agreement among world producers, but some officials say disease and drought make cuts unnecessary in some countries.\nAfrican producers agreed after a January meeting of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries to cut robusta exports by a total of 850,000 60-kilo bags between January and June 1997 in an attempt to force up prices.\nIndividual country quotas were left to be decided later.\n\"We shall be looking into the export programme in light of the Rio (de Janeiro) agreement and our objective is to ensure a transparent and effective implementation,\" said a spokesman for the Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO).\n\"The ministers will take a decision on how to allocate the share which falls on Africa and how to deal with shortfalls,\" said IACO chief economist Donald Kaberuka. \"We will also discuss the issue of non-member countries.\"\nEight countries will take part in the talks -- Uganda, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Kenya, Zaire, Tanzania, Madagascar and Ethiopia.\nQuotas for individual countries set at the meeting would not be made public.\n\"Some people have said we will not make any cuts but that is not true,\" said Kaberuka.\nA Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) official said this week that drought and disease had cut into that country's exports, making quotas unnecessary.\nUganda is Africa's largest robusta producer.\nIt produced around 4,644,397 60-kilo bags in 1996 against 3,079,261 in 1995, according to IACO. Ivory Coast produced 2,526,198 and 2,493,754 over the same periods.\nAnalysts in Ivory Coast say bean quality problems could mean no more than 130,000-150,000 tonnes will be exported in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) despite an official forecast of 230,000 tonnes.\nIvorian exports by the end of January totalled little more than 24,000 tonnes. The season opened on November 14.\nThe Coffee Board of Kenya, also citing drought and disease, has forecast a drop in production and earnings this year.\nZaire's production has been cut by the conflict there since late 1996.\n", "The Australian stock exchange on Tuesday used the China visit of Prime Minister John Howard to make a high profile sales pitch for Chinese companies to list shares on Australia's stock market.\nThe Australian prime minister, before meeting China's President Jiang Zemin, found time to open a seminar for China's market regulators and top-level managers of its state-run companies designed to show them why they should look to Australia to raise capital.\nSenior officials from the Australian Stock Exchange as well as brokerages and legal firms delivered the message that Australia had much to offer.\n\"Cross-border equities trading now amounts to around $4 trillion a year, which no stock market can afford to ignore,\" Australian Stock Exchange chairman Maurice Newman told the seminar.\n\"I hope that one day we may be able to welcome you to our market.\"\nMost Chinese companies that have listed their shares abroad have chosen Hong Kong where investors have been snapping up China-related stocks.\nOne recent listing of a China-linked company was nearly 900 times oversubscribed, and Australia may find it difficult to generate that kind of interest.\nNewman later told reporters that 19 of 31 Asian-owned companies on the Australian exchange already had a China connection. These companies have often used a corporation not based in China to make the listing, in effect sidestepping regulatory curbs in their home country.\nTrading in some of those issues has not been active.\n\"The liquidity of those companies is mixed,\" said Newman. \"As a group we would prefer that it were greater.\"\nAustralia may soon get its first direct Chinese listing.\nTaihang Cement, a cement producer based in the northern province of Hebei, has already gained approval from Chinese regulatory authorities for a foreign listing.\nCompany officials told reporters they hoped to list their shares in Australia by the year-end.\n\"We chose Australia because we have a foundation there,\" said Zhang Zhixian, Taihang's manager of investment development, noting that the company exports cement to Australia.\nCompany officials said the exact size of the offer had not been set but would range between 100 and 200 million yuan ($12-24 million).\nOther participants at the seminar said Australia might target its efforts at sectors where Australia is already strong, such as in natural resources.\n\"Australia would have a natural advantage in infrastructure and resource-based companies,\" said Tony Greenwood, of law firm Blake Dawson Waldron, noting the heavy weighting of such stocks in Australia.\nOne area of concern for Chinese companies will be financial transparency, which has posed a problem for them in the past.\nSome Chinese companies have had trouble complying with domestic regulations and others have come under criticism in Hong Kong for lack of transparency.\n\"Our concern must also be the integrity of our market,\" said Newman.\n\"It is important that companies are familiar with our listing requirements and they observe them faithfully.\"\n", "Europe's envoy in Hong Kong on Thursday said the European Union had lost credibility by falling into public disarray over a resolution at the United Nations designed to censure China for human rights violations.\n\"We are now not as credible an interlocutor matching the commercial clout we have because we are not united,\" Etienne Reuter, head of the European Commission in Hong Kong, said in an interview with Reuters.\n\"We haven't helped our own image, and we haven't helped the cause of furthering human rights in China... It has certainly weakened our position here,\" the envoy said.\nThe Geneva resolution, sponsored by Denmark and backed by the United States, failed to win EU support when France said that recent human rights improvements by China suggested dialogue was better than confrontation.\nThis is the first year the EU has failed to back the resolution since the 1989 Beijing massacre, when China crushed democracy protesters in a bloody crackdown around Tiananmen Square.\n\"This means that...when (people in Hong Kong) look for help or support they will tend to look first to North America or maybe even to Japan, rather than believe the Europeans have the cards to play. That is, I think, the sad reality,\" Reuter said.\nDenmark, the United States and human rights activists condemned the EU's silence, which fell in the year that Hong Kong reverts from British to Chinese rule.\nThe United States is also usually seen as the most outspoken defender of human rights in Hong Kong, but Reuter argued Europe also should have a role to play.\nUnder the \"one country, two systems\" formula, Hong Kong will retain considerable autonomy for 50 years as a Special Administrative Region within China.\nBut as the July 1 handover nears, concern is rising that many key freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people will soon be lost.\nMoves by future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa to trim civil liberties have provoked condemnation from many sides in Hong Kong and prompted criticism from the United States.\nBeijing responded by telling the United States to stop meddling in China's internal affairs.\nThe EU's Reuter said he hoped the \"Geneva debacle\" reminded Europe that its future influence in Hong Kong depended upon unity, particularly as the handover approaches.\n\"The indications for a smooth transition...are good, so I would not like to paint a dark scenario for the future, but I certainly think it is important for the Europeans to realise they can only be effective here if they are united,\" he said.\nThe incident also had drawn attention to Europe's urgent need for a common foreign policy, one geared more to common interests rather than values.\n\"You will always have realists versus idealists, and people thinking, 'Why should it be our job to be the world's policeman or the world's preacher?' (This) is a discussion which concerns everybody in Europe and not only France,\" he said.\nAn outstanding deal by an Airbus Industrie-led consortium to build a 100-seat plane in a Chinese joint venture had little to do with France's objection, Reuter said.\n\"I don't think people should think it's only because of a couple of Airbuses that France did not support the concept of the resolution in Geneva,\" he said.\nFrench President Jacques Chirac is due to sign the deal during a visit to China in May, although Beijing said recently that more work was needed to finalise the contract and called upon the European side to offer better terms.\n", "Tin production at one of China's biggest mines has been cut by summer flooding, but a lacklustre market means business has not been affected, an executive with Deng's Yunnan Tin Corp said on Monday.\nGejiu Tin Mine in southern Yunnan province was damaged by floods in June and July, deputy general manager Sheng Weichung told Reuters.\nDeng's Yunnan Tin Corp is the Hong Kong representative and trading arm of Yunnan Tin Corp, China's biggest tin producer.  \nIn 1995, Sheng said, Yunnan Tin Corp produced 20,000 tonnes of tin. The Gejiu mine was the company's biggest, he said.\n\"But business has been slow in China because the world market is soft and because of domestic restructuring of the industry, changes in government policy and tight credit,\" Sheng said. \"So a cut in production at the Gejiu mine would not have any adverse affect on China's overall tin industry picture.\"\nIt was unclear how extensive the damage to the mine was, he said, or by how much production had been cut.  \nChina expected to produce 45,000 tonnes of tin in 1996, an official of the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp said in July.\nHe forecast 1996 exports of 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes.\nTotal 1995 tin exports were 43,307 tonnes, down 2.4 percent on the year before, China's State Statistical Bureau reported.\nTotal Chinese tin production for the first half of 1996 was down 6.14 percent on the same 1995 period, to 25,944 tonnes, the figures show.  \nExports for the first half of 1996 of unwrought tin and tin alloys were 12,867 tonnes, down 27 percent on the first half of 1995, customs figures show.\nTin exports in June were 3,339 tonnes.\nDespite its size and the high quality of its product, Yunnan Tin Corp was still a \"loss-making state enterprise\" and as such was facing tough times, Sheng said.\nA labour force of 100,000 had been cut within the past two years to 40,000 with the introduction of a redundancy programme that offered lump sum payments, he said.  \nSenior management had also been trying to raise capital abroad to help get expansion projects off the ground, he said.\nOther metals markets in China continued slow, traders said.\nA return to pre-summer volatility that saw London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices fluctuate sharply throughout last week would keep China business slow, traders said.\nThree month copper values on the LME traded between $1,905 and $1,970 a tonne in the July 30-August 29 period, giving traders some hope that calm had returned to the market after Sumitomo Corp revealed in June it had lost US$1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised trading.  \nBut the calm was shortlived.

Beijing says its figures show a net trade deficit with Washington.\nThe growing trade gap has increasingly become a source of cross-Pacific friction, with U.S. industries demanding more access to the huge Chinese market as China's economy continues to boom, the first diplomat said.\nWhile many senior Chinese officials were becoming more aware of the benefits WTO membership could bring to China, Beijing would have to be prepared to shoulder the responsibilities that came with being a world trade power.\n\"They become big players on a big stage, but you don't do that irresponsibly,\" the first diplomat said.\n", "A new generation of drug lords is growing up in Colombia around the booming production and export of heroin, anti-narcotics chief Col. Leonardo Gallego said on Friday.\n\"There are indications of an emergent trend of new groups becoming involved in the heroin trade,\" Gallego told Reuters. But he said this did not rule out participation in the lucrative trade by \"existing groups combining or switching the traffic of one substance with another.\"\nColombian and U.S. authorities, celebrating last weekend's surrender of the last Cali Cartel kingpin, were hit by figures this week showing that 62 percent of the heroin on U.S. streets comes from South America, much of it from Colombia.\nThat means that in addition to dominating the U.S. cocaine market, Colombia, and to a lesser extent Venezuela and Peru, have displaced southeast Asia as the major source of heroin.\nGallego, who has headed the anti-narcotics division of the National Police for two years, believes the new U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates are high, but he conceded the emerging pattern is worrying and calculated Colombia could be producing as much as five tonnes of heroin a year.\nAbout 12,000 acres (5,000 hectares) of Colombia's rural drug farms are now sown with opium poppies, anti-narcotics intelligence shows. Some of the crop is in the traditional coffee-producing province of Tolima in central Colombia and in neighbouring Huila and Cauca. Significant harvests are also expected in the northern provinces of Cesar and Guajira.\nPoppy cultivation is a recent phenomenon in Colombia, where the export of heroin was unknown before 1991. Gallego said domestic social and economic conditions along with the success of the war on drugs in Southeast Asia had helped displace production to South America.\nHe said Pakistanis and Afghans had travelled to Colombia to teach cultivation and processing techniques but, judging by discoveries of two clandestine laboratories last month, he said methods did not yet appear too sophisticated.\nBut the report issued by the DEA in Washington Tuesday said South American heroin flooding the streets of cities across the northeastern United States was 30 percent more pure than the traditional Asian variety.\nColombian authorities have agreed to destroy 9,885 acres (4,000 hectares) of poppy and 44,500 acres (18,000 hectares) of coca leaf this year under a deal signed with the United States in July. Heavy rains and strong winds have hampered the spraying of illegal plantations in the south and east but Gallego said he was confident the target of Latin America's most ambitious eradication programme could be achieved.\nLast weekend, tense U.S.-Colombian relations received a boost when Helmer Herrera, the only leader of the Cali-based cocaine cartel still at large, gave himself up. But Gallego warned against overoptimism, saying: \"There must be a decrease in the operational capacity of the (Cali) network but results cannot be expected in the short term.\"\nU.S. drug experts say Cali cartel kingpins continue to run much of their criminal empire from jail. Gallego said there were signs Colombian cartels were even diversifying supply routes away from the United States. Intelligence reports, as yet unconfirmed, say cocaine is being shipped from Colombia to Angola and then transferred to Europe and the Far East.\n", "Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp is in talks with France's Cie Generale des Eaux about taking a stake in its French railway venture, a CGE unit said on Tuesday.\nThe talks could bring the world's biggest telecoms group closer to one of its keenest suitors -- British Telecommunications Plc.\nCGE's subsidiary Cegetel, in which BT is investing 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) to take a 25 percent stake, confirmed the talks after a source close to CGE told Reuters in London NTT was considering a 9.9 percent stake in CGE's railway venture, Telecom Developpement, TD.\n\"Generale des Eaux is in talks with NTT,\" a source close to the French company told Reuters.\nCegetel, which is France's second telecoms operator and majority-owned by CGE, can take a stake of up to 49.9 percent in TD. But it might limit its holding to 40 percent and seek a minority partner to take the balance, the source said.\nBT, with its U.S. partner MCI Communications Corp , has been trying to gain a foothold in the lucrative Asian markets for years as has been openly courting NTT.\nAsia remains the last gap in BT and MCI's global jigsaw of deals that span the globe, offering sophisticated communications services mainly to high-margin, corporate customers.\nAlthough BT and NTT are collaborating in a bid to secure the second national licence in Singapore, BT has so far failed to clinch a closer deal with the company in Japan.\nThe Japanese company, which is looking to make its first foreign investment in a key European market, has been eyeing the 117 billion franc ($20 billion) French telecom market since the summer when it started talks about joining Cegetel, the source said.\nAnalysts say Cegetel is well-placed to launch as assault on monopoly France Telecom when the market, which is expected to grow to 187 billion francs by 2003, is eased open to competition in 1998.\nBut Cegetel's partners -- CGE, BT, Germany's Mannesmann AG and SBC Communications Inc of the U.S. -- were unwilling to make place for the Japanese heavyweight by selling part of their stakes in a pivotal European market.\nHowever in February, Cegetel was selected to run a network owned by Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF) via the state-owned rail group's subsidiary, Telecom Developpement.\nThe move boosted Cegetel's position as second national operator, giving it access to 8,000 kilometres of optic fibre across the country, as well as radio links, which will be expanded to some 12,000 kilometres in the next six years.\nIt also opened up the possibility of a deal with NTT.\nCegetel, which already runs France's second-biggest mobile telecommunications network SFR, plans to buy at least 40 percent of the shares in TD, leaving up to 9.9 percent for the right strategic partner.\n\"(Cegetel) can go up to 49.9 percent in a partnership where this partner will be a minority partner,\" the source said, adding that talks with NTT have now centred on this venture.\nHe declined to divulge how much the stakes were worth.\nAlthough NTT is not the only potential minority partner in talks with CGE, the source declined to name other parties.\n\"It is quite possible that nothing happens for a year,\" he noted.\nInvestment bankers expect NTT to be looking to gain a toe-hold in the top four or five European markets and say they would be surprised if efforts are being focused exclusively on France.\nThe company has not been short of suitors. NTT, which was in December freed by the government to pursue international business, controls virtually all of the local network in Japan as well as having a large presence in Asia.\nThere are three main global alliances that are eager to link up with NTT; BT and MCI's Concert, Global One; which incorporates France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom AG and America's Sprint Corp and U.S. telecoms giant AT &amp; T Corp's loosely-knit global alliance World Partners/Unisource.\n($ = 5.747 French Francs)\n", "CSX Corp. raised the stakes in the bidding war for Conrail Inc. on Thursday, amending its friendly merger agreement with the railroad to give unhappy shareholders another $870 million and bringing the total value of its offer to $9.5 billion.\nRichmond, Va.-based CSX and Conrail of Philadelphia are battling with Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern Corp., which has bid $10 billion, or $110 per share in cash, for Conrail. Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's offer, contending that a transaction with CSX is a better fit.\nThe new agreement would give Conrail shareholders another $16 per share, payable in CSX convertible preferred shares, as part of the stock portion of the cash and stock transaction.\nBased on Thursday trading in CSX shares, an industry analyst estimated the value of the new CSX-Conrail deal at $104 per share, or $9.5 billion. The value of the stock portion of the deal changes daily as the stocks of the companies rise and fall.\n\"In every respect this merger holds great potential and clearly offers the best result for Conrail. This amendment to the merger agreement reaffirms the decision of the Conrail board that it is not willing to agree to the sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern,\" Conrail Chairman David LeVan said in a statement.\nNorfolk Southern immediately indicated that it was not walking away from its hostile effort. Industry experts widely expect it to raise its bid soon.\n\"There should be no doubt that Norfolk Southern remains as determined as ever to acquire Conrail and will use any and all appropriate financial means to accomplish that objective,\" Norfolk Southern said in a statement.\nIn a further enticement to investors, CSX and Conrail established a voting trust to accelerate payment to Conrail shareholders by 1997. Previously, shareholders would have not been paid until the transaction received required regulatory and other approvals.\nThe establishment of the voting trust is likely to encourage some shareholders to tender their stock to CSX and exit the controversial transaction, experts said.\nOne of the most controversial portions of the revised deal prohibits both CSX and Conrail from pursuing a merger with another company before the end of 1998. Shareholders, who had opposed the previous deadline of mid-1997 on the grounds that it prevented Conrail from considering a potentially higher offer, blasted the extension.\nMembers of the investment community also expect Norfolk Southern to challenge the exclusivity period in court. An attorney for Norfolk Southern said legal action was probably forthcoming.\nOther aspects of the Conrail-CSX agreement are unchanged. They include $110 per share for 40 percent of the outstanding Conrail shares and 1.85619 shares of CSX common stock for each Conrail share.\nCSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in a cash tender offer at $110 per share and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent.\nConrail also delayed a special shareholder meeting to Jan. 17 from Dec. 23, and CSX extended its tender offer to Jan. 22. At the meeting, shareholders are to consider a key provision that would effectively permit CSX to proceed with the acquisition.\nMany members of the investment community had predicted shareholders would defeat the provision.\nWhile the new terms were widely considered to be more attractive, Wall Street and industry sources said they may not be strong enough to clinch the deal.\nThe new pact \"definitely doesn't lock it up because you've got to wait for Norfolk Southern to come back. It definitely makes it more attractive and more equitable across the board,\" said analyst Peter Gleason of Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder advisory firm that last week recommended investors defeat the provision at the special shareholder meeting.\nThe proposed merger of Conrail and CSX, first announced Oct. 15, would create a giant that would dominate the rail freight industry on the East Coast.\nIn afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Conrail shares rose $1.875 to $100.875, CSX shares fell $1.25 to $44 and Norfolk Southern rose $2.25 to $88.50.\n\"The actions taken by the CSX and Conrail boards allow us to move on to the next stage of the process, the filing of our merger application with the (Surface Transportation Board),\" the federal regulatory agency overseeing railroads, said CSX Chairman John Snow.\nAnthony Hatch of NatWest Securities noted that the deal was becoming less financially attractive to the prospective buyers as the bidding war continues.\n\"We're bumping up against the point at which this is getting pricey. It still makes some sense, but for CSX it's getting close,\" Hatch said, adding that Norfolk Southern can well afford to raise its offer.\n", "North Carolina's attorney general on Friday questioned the legal utility of the industry documents Liggett Group has promised to hand over for use against fellow cigarette companies.\nLiggett, a unit of Brooke Group, on Thursday agreed as part of a settlement with 22 state governments suing it to deliver internal documents that may help the states press their cases against Philip Morris and others.\n\"It's hard to see how Liggett Group would give up evidence of criminal behaviour,\" Easley said.  \nEasley has not filed a suit like 22 of his peers seeking compensation for billions of dollars spent by state governments on treating sick smokers. He favors a legislative resolution.\nNorth Carolina is the biggest tobacco-producing state in the country and home to leading manufacturers. Its governor has allied with the tobacco industry in fighting federal limits on marketing cigarettes, especially to young people.  \nThe contents of the documents has not been made public. And tobacco company lawyers have secured an order barring the delivery until at least March 31, when a North Carolina state judge will hear arguments on whether not the Liggett handover would violate lawyer-client privileges for other companies.\nEasley dismissed as \"aggressive\" remarks by attorneys general announcing the Liggett deal on Thursday that the internal documents would be crucial in proving allegations of a conspiracy among the tobacco companies.\nA Liggett promise to pay 25 percent of pre-tax profits for a quarter of a century was worthless, he said, because Liggett has not been profitable in many years.\n\"It would appear that the (plaintiff) attorneys only wanted to get some papers,\" Easley said.\nEasley backed a bill in the North Carolina legislature that would regulate cigarette marketing to children.\nThe courtroom battles against the tobacco industry would be resolved only by a sweeping new law from Washington, Easley said.\n", "A long-awaited early 1997 measure of Czech M2 money supply showed no signs of surfacing on Monday, causing traders and analysts who use the numbers for investment strategy to vent their frustrations.\n\"It's incredibly frustrating, because the Czech National Bank keeps referring to M2 as one of its most important statistics and it's consistently released very late,\" said Matt Starr, a fixed-income analyst at Creditanstalt in Prague.\nWhile central banks of most major economies and many post-communist neighbours have already released key money supply figures for well into 1997, the Czech National Bank (CNB) has yet to publish any for the year.\nThe CNB said on Monday it still had no definite release date for January's M2 data, although the figures may come soon.\n\"Definitely not today. Maybe tomorrow or after tomorrow,\" Pavel Palivec, a CNB spokesman, told Reuters.\n\"No legal norms\" require a release of M2 data, he said, adding that slow reporting of commercial banks was partly to blame for the tardier-than-usual release.\nTension has grown ahead of the government's economic stimulus package on Wednesday, where some analysts believe that a rapid decline in M2 may enable the cabinet to succeed in pushing the central bank into lowering key interest rates.\n\"They (the CNB) may be waiting for political reasons, but it's putting a lot of people off,\" said one trader at the Prague office of a foreign bank.\nAnalysts are hoping to see end-February figures, although January data is more likely.\nThey say it is difficult to forecast privately and that much of the data included in the M2 calculation has long been at the central bank's disposal.\nThe CNB has never had a set release date for its key M2 figure, but in 1996 the lag time was usually around one-and-a- half to two-and-a-half months after the period being measured.\nThe last M2 release was on March 13, when the CNB said M2 at end-December was 7.8 percent higher than the same 1995 month. That was a slowing from November which showed a rise of 9.7 percent year-on-year.\nNovember's results were released on January 23.\nAnalysts are watching M2 closely since growth in the money supply slowed from a double-digit rate last year ahead of central bank tightening measures in June.\nThe government has said a drop in March's 12-month inflation rate to 6.8 percent from nine percent for much of 1996 came at the cost of a slowdown in economic growth.\nThe criticism has kept many watching for a possible lowering of interest rates, monetary conditions permitting.\nCreditanstalt's Starr said he expects the figures -- after an inflow of more than 30 billion crowns in crown Eurobonds in January -- might give the central bank less room to manoeuvre, helping its argument to keep rates higher.\n\"I actually think the M2 figure for January is going to be bad with all those Eurobonds they haven't been able to sterilise (pull out of circulation),\" Starr said.\nCompared with other central banks, the CNB-published figures lag well behind:\n* Germany's Bundesbank has a roughly three-day window around the 20th of each month to release its key M3 data for the preceding month.\n* The U.S. Federal Reserve measures M2 weekly and releases the results within three to five days, adding up roughly $4 trillion circulating and saved in the U.S. economy.\n* The neighbouring Polish central bank releases its broad money data for each month within 10 days after the end of the period measured.

It is not intended to drag unwilling players along a path that the majority thinks desirable,\" said Alston in reply to a question about reports that China was reluctant to adopt telecom liberalisation.\n\"Whilst there might be some domestic reservations about particular aspects, the overall guiding principles are well recognised. You simply don't find a member economy that does not espouse the principles of the reforms in this area,\" he said.  \nAlthough there were no tangible projects to come out of the meeting, ministers agreed on further collaboration on working groups to look at telecommunications for rural development, distance education, information sharing and the environment.\n\"It would be very short sighted if we simply committed ourselves to physical rollout without taking into account the effect to the natural environment,\" Alston said.\nAlston said rapid technological change in informational technology and telecommunications had thrown up new challenges, such as dealing with the acceptance of electronic commerce and taxation issues that go along with it.  \n\"Undoubtably there will a reluctance to fully embrace electronic commerce and all of its manifestations, until we do solve problems of privacy,\" Alston said.\nAlston said he expected electronic commerce to be a growing industry once encryption and security issues had been resolved, but taxation issues will start become more important.\n\"It hasn't yet reached the stage of being an avalanche of siphoning off the revenue from the taxation authorities, but it clearly has some potential in that regard and I think all member economies are aware of the need to handle the issue,\" he said.  \nThe next meeting of telecom ministers is in Singapore in mid-1998.

Surgeon general is the highest medical post in the federal government.  \nA jury trial in Dade County Court is scheduled to begin on June 2 and will be the first class-action suit to come to trial in the United States against the tobacco industry.  It is but one case in a wide courtroom assault on cigarette makers.\nIn a class-action suit, used in the past against asbestos makers on behalf of victims of lung diseases, a small group seeks damages on behalf of a much larger number of people with like injuries.\nA second class-action suit on behalf of all Florida smokers is scheduled for trial in Miami in September.  \n\"He will testify that the tobacco industry did everything it could to impede the information from getting to the public, from getting to the scientific community,\" Rosenblatt said, referring to Steinfeld during a pre-trial hearing.\nSteinfeld is also scheduled to testify for Mississippi, whose attorney general is suing tobacco companies to recoup the cost of treating sick smokers through its Medicaid program. Twenty-one other states, including Florida, have filed similar suits.  \nRosenblatt accuses Philip Morris Cos Inc and other leading cigarette makers of purposely misleading Americans and conspiring with one another on hiding the medical risks of second-hand smoke to sustain corporate profits.\nRosenblatt gave no details of the promised testimony.

He put the cost of the project at 160 million French francs.\nIvory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual crop locally by the year 2000 to add export value and remove lower quality late season (May-Sept), or mid-crop, beans from international markets.\nCEMOI's factory would open at its full capacity but could be upgraded to 120,000 tonnes after two years, producing cocoa liquor and cocoa cake and butter, Poivrier said. Work began at the construction site in northern Abidjan (Yopougon) on Friday, he added.\nCEMOI, one of Europe's largest chocolate confectioners, uses 40,000 tonnes of raw cocoa beans a year and would sell products from the extra 20,000 tonnes capacity mainly to Europe and perhaps China.\n\"We are also looking at markets in China,\" he said.\nPoivrier said the factory had been planned to secure a regular supply of good quality cocoa and by-pass Ivorian commodity exporters.\nIvory Coast already has three cocoa processing factories with capacity for processing up to 160,000 tonnes of beans a year.\nEurope's Callebaut Barry group owns two factories.

Jiang, for instance, was not born in Shanghai, though he cut his political teeth here.\n\"The people he is going to feel most comfortable having around him are the people he worked with,\" said an analyst.\nBut their abilities in the task of running a modern government are probably even more valuable, the analysts said.\nShanghainese are perceived as competent administrators and canny business people.\n\"The Shanghainese do have a reputation for being very skillful at administration and business,\" said a Shanghai-based diplomat.\n\"And that's where China is right now -- they need competant people, people with management experience. And the management experience in Shanghai is one which is needed in the centre,\" he said.\nThe move late last year to Beijing of Shanghai's vice mayor in charge of the economy Hua Jianming fitted into this pattern, analysts said.\nHua was widely respected for his management and administrative skills, said an Asian diplomat, \"and he was brought into the centre to use those skills\".\n\"The Shanghainese clique are simply very expeditious at implementing other people's vision because, essentially, they are technocrats and that's what China needs,\" said a Western analyst.\n", "Industry and crop analysts are sticking to forecasts of a total Ivorian 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) cocoa crop of well over one million tonnes though the government appears to say it will be less than that figure.\n\"We raised our forecast to 1.07 million tonnes in January from one million tonnes but really there could be 1.1 million tonnes,\" said one major buyer of Ivorian cocoa.\nIvorian Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan restated on Wednesday in Paris that Ivory Coast's total 1996/97 crop would be less than one million tonnes -- in line with an earlier Ivorian Caistab marketing board estimate of 950,000 tonnes.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Kouassi was referring to total arrivals of cocoa at ports, or beans considered to be of sufficient quality for export.\n\"That would certainly not be the total arrivals figure but it could be the export figure,\" said one port source.\n\"Arrivals (of cocoa declared at ports) are already close to 900,000 tonnes (since October 1) so we are really looking at a crop of not much less than last year,\" said another source.\nSources close to the agriculture ministry said arrivals figures to February 21 (since October 24) stood at around 850,000 tonnes.\nQuality inspectors have pointed to generally good bean quality depite humidity problems.\nThe 1996/97 cocoa season opened on October 24, about three weeks later than usual.

Little goes to waste so it will be sold somehow,\" said one exporter, referring to humidity problems in early 1997.\nOne set of figures circulating put arrivals to February 21 at 936,000 tonnes, with close to 150,000 tonnes initially classified as sub-grade, industry sources said.\nIvory Coast has said in the past it would process its lower quality mid-crop cocoa locally to remove lower grades from world markets and add more value to exports.\n\"Local factories will probably use about 160,000 tonnes this year so a certain proportion will be set aside for that,\" one source said.\nFactory capacity currently stands at around 180,000 tonnes although plans for more factories are reaching final stages.\nForeign buyers recently voiced concern that poorer grades were being mixed in with export quality cocoa rather than being absorbed by local factories.\n\"The normal crop potential for Ivory Coast is around 1.17 million tonnes,\" said one port source. \"Take off 160,000 tonnes and you are not far off the one million figure,\" he added.\n\"The question is how much will be held back for next year to speculate on prices.

Most of those planes have yet to be ordered.\nBoeing officials, quoting Chinese data, said they were well ahead in the China market so far with some 216 planes in service against 29 for Airbus.\nBut Boeing underwent a dry spell in 1996, notching only a handful of sales in a year in which Sino-U.S. ties were rocked by Beijing's sabre-rattling aimed at Taiwan as well as disputes over trade, arms control and human rights.\nAirbus signed a pact for 30 of the Airbus A320 narrow body jets in April last year in a deal worth $1.5 billion.\nThose planes compete with Boeing's smaller 737 jets.\nBoeing officials said that with some of the political friction out of the way, they expect more market inroads, and note the latest deal brings this year's sales to $1.2 billion.\nBut analysts cautioned that despite the improvement in Sino-U.S. ties, issues between the two states were unlikely to be resolved soon and would add a political tint to future commercial deals.\n", "British supermarket retailer J. Sainsbury Plc tried to steal a march on its competitors on Friday by launching insurance products through its Homebase do-it-yourself subsidiary.\nThe deal, which sees Sainsbury teaming up with brokers Willis Corroon, will offer home and contents insurance, garden insurance and personal accident insurance with details to be released to the public in early February.\nSainsbury became the first supermarket to announce plans to break into banking in October when it teamed up with Bank of Scotland to set up Sainsbury's Bank, which awaits a licence from UK authorities.\nThe insurance service will be offered to all Homebase customers which are thought to total around 12 million, with initial marketing aimed at the unit's two million loyalty card holders.\nThe service will be provided by a panel made up of Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, Guardian Royal Exchange, Norwich Union, Eagle Star and Lloyds of London.\n\"We believe that the Homebase brand values can make a real difference in the home insurance market,\" Mike Samuel, Homebase head of marketing, said in a statement.\nSainsbury said the major features of the products would be 250 pounds ($420.2) emergency cover, cover for home removal, Christmas, birthdays and accidental damage to televisions and satellites.\nIn addition, discounts of over 50 pounds would be offered on Homebase security products when a policy is taken out.\n\"The product chosen by Sainsbury's Homebase encompasses all the expected features of home insurance but with a safety net of cover not usually available with standard market products,\" said Richard Fry, head of business development at Willis Corroon.\nSainsbury shares had closed down five pence at 387.5 pence before the announcement was made.\nAnalysts said they were encouraged when Sainsbury moved into banking as there had been concerns that it was losing more and more ground to arch-rival Tesco.\nTesco was the first of the big four supermarket groups to launch a loyalty card and its success forced Sainsbury to bring out its own version around a year later in June 1996.\nSafeway also has a loyalty card while ASDA is now testing its own version in selected stores.\nMeanwhile Tesco has added a ClubCard Plus credit account for customers while Safeway teamed up with high-street bank Abbey National in November to offer banking services through its ABC loyalty card.

Impressions, or how many times an ad is viewed, are the advertising industry's standard way of measuring the impact of individual ad promotions.\nAmerica Online stock rose $3.75 to $43.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. That rise followed a gain of $2.50 on Monday.\n\"AOL has the largest online chat community in the universe,\" Bob Pittman, the president of America Online Networks, the company's main operating unit, said in a statement.\n\"Over 70 percent of our members chat and we log 1 million hours of chat every day, a figure that has more than doubled over the last six months,\" he said.\nLehman Brothers analyst Brian Oakes estimated \"chat rooms\" account for about 23 percent of online usage time among America Online subscribers.\nOakes said America Online places ads on less than 4 percent of the screens its subscribers view, marking it as a significant revenue growth opportunity for the company.\nIf ads ran on all interactive services on America Online, including chat, electronic mail, special interest bulletin boards and its \"instant messages\" subscriber messaging system, America Online could book as much as $500 million in advertising revenues, he said.\nAmerica Online's chat area, known as \"People Connection,\" creates up to 14,000 virtual chat rooms with up to 23 people in one area.\nAdvertisements would rotate every 60 seconds, utilizing America Online's new software ad delivery technology, the company said.\nThe ads will run in company-sponsored chat rooms like Town Square (current events), Life, Romance, Special Interest, Places, Arts &amp; Entertainment, and News, Sports &amp; Finance. Advertising will not be targeted at private chat rooms created by members themselves, the company said.\nAs an example, Oakes said sponsored chat rooms could include a Michael Jordan chat session with his fans, sponsored by Nike, or a health care discussion, sponsored by Johnson &amp; Johnson.\nDaytime TV talk show host Rosie O'Donnell's recent appearance set a record on America Online with more than 16,000 simultaneous participants signing on during the programme, he said.\nAdding advertising to chat rooms represents America Online's latest bid to boost revenues from sources other than subscriber fees.\nLast week, America Online announced a deal with Tel-Save Holdings Inc., a long distance phone service provider, in which America Online received a $100 million payment from Tel-Save to market its long-distance services to America Online members.\nThe online service has said it expected an increasing portion of its revenues to come from ads instead of just subcriber fees as it grows beyond its roots as an online access company to become a diversified media company.\n\"This is yet another asset that we have that will allow America Online to capture an ever larger percentage of online and Internet advertising spending,\" Pittman said of the plan to mix advertising with online chat sessions.\nAmerica Online is the world's largest Internet online service with about 8 million members.\n", "Shareholders of MCI Communications Corp. are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposed merger with British Telecommunications Plc at MCI's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday.\nThe shareholder vote is one of the first major milestones on the road to winning approval for the $23 billion trans-Atlantic merger, which would create a combined company known as Concert Plc with $40.6 billion in revenues.\nThe merger awaits regulatory approvals in Washington, London and Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union. Company officials are confident the merger -- announced in November -- is on track to close in the fall of 1997.\nThe annual meeting, to be held in Wilkes Barre, Pa., two hours north of Philadelphia, is expected to be a quiet affair, with only three items on the agenda -- the shareholder vote, and election of directors and auditors.\nWilkes Barre was chosen because it was the hometown of William McGowan, the legendary founder and former chairman of MCI, who died in June 1992. Washington-based MCI is the nation's second largest long distance company.\nIn his speech to shareholders Wednesday, Bert Roberts, MCI's current chairman and chief executive, is expected to focus on the projected benefits of its merger, which creates one of the world's first global communications carriers.\nOne industry analyst briefed by the company said he expected Roberts to reveal some of the early products and services that may result from its ties to British Telecom.\nAmong the possible offerings would be seamless services connecting the United States and Britain, including wireless phone transmission, faxing, electronic mail, voice mail and the Internet, the analyst said.\nIndustry analysts believe the MCI official will also respond to AT&amp;T Corp.'s initiative to offer local phone service using a fixed wireless system attached to the side of a customer's premises as a means of bypassing local networks controlled by regional Bell companies.\nThrough interconnection pacts and the new wireless technology, AT&amp;T has said by 1998 it plans to offer local service to the vast majority of the U.S. population.\nMCI made an early move into local phone markets with its MCI Metro unit, but has appeared less aggresive than its peers since the passage of the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 in evolving a strategy to expand its local phone presence.\nA key benefit of the merger with cash-rich British Telecom is the financing muscle that MCI can tap as MCI seeks to slice substantial market share away from the incumbent regional Bell telephone companies in various local service markets.\nMCI provides local service in 20 U.S. metropolitan markets through a mix of company-owned facilities and resale agreements to use other companies' networks. It has said it plans to be in 31 local service markets by the end of 1997.\n", "United Wisconsin Services Inc expects its medical-loss ratio to decline to levels not seen in years as long as Washington does not spring another healthcare reform initiative on the HMO industry.\nIn an interview with Reuters, United Wisconsin chief executive Thomas Hefty said the ratio -- the share of premium revenues spent covering HMO members' healthcare costs -- could fall into the seventies. \"The loss ratio is higher than we would like, but we're seeing, particularly in our small-group PPO unit, an improvement over last year,\" Hefty said.  \nUnited Wisconsin finished its second quarter in June with its medical-loss ratio at 81.9 percent, down from 88.3 percent a year earlier. Hefty said it could fall to the seventies.\nPremium revenues that are left over after covering member costs constitute the bulk of profits for a health maintenance organization, or HMO. \"We think the industry overall is poised for a better 1997 and 1998,\" Hefty said. \"Probably the biggest uncertainty in the market is the reaction to the election.\"\nWhen the Clinton administration unveiled its healthcare reform proposal in 1994, medical cost inflation plummeted and HMO profits soared.  \nWhen healthcare reform failed, medical cost inflation roared back and profits suffered industry-wide. These trends have moderated recently, Hefty said, but he added that Hillary Clinton's speech at the Democratic Convention caused concern.\n\"It said that if the Democrats have a big victory, we'll see healthcare reform again with all of the interplay on the psychology of patients and physicians,\" he said.\nIn the meantime, Hefty said he sees room for premium hikes to boost HMOs' profits. \"In our market in Wisconsin, we compete against Humana and United Healthcare and both of them have been taking strong pricing action,\" he said.\n\"We're out there with price increases. Underlying healthcare trends have been coming down again,\" Hefty said.\nEnrollment at United Wisconsin is growing, as well \"The Milwaukee HMO has a lost a little bit of enrollment with price increases, but we're still overall up a couple percent\" due to enrollment gains in the company's rural HMOs, he said.\n\"Our strategy is to keep looking for the rural markets ... We think those are good markets. You get better margins and we've shown the ability to not only get those margins, but get operating costs down,\" Hefty said.\n", "The largest online services providers reacted cautiously to a plan announced Tuesday that would vastly expand the number of possible address names on the Internet.\nInternet Society, which helps develop standards on the global computer network, said it had approved a plan to add seven new top-level domains, the last three letters at the end of every electronic mail or Web site address.\nWhile some major Internet companies endorsed the plan, online service providers gave it a cool reception.  \n\"We are still studying the proposal,\" said William Burrington, director of law and public policy at America Online Inc. While praising the plan's concept, Burrington said he thought \"it still needs some more work.\"\nAmerica Online, the largest online service in the world with more than eight million members, hopes to craft a better plan \"that is more saleable,\" he added.\nThe largest pure Internet service provider, AT&amp;T Corp's Worldnet service, was equally unenthusiastic. \"We are still looking at these domain names,\" spokesman Mike Miller said.  \n\"We are studying them, trying to better understand what it means for our business,\" Miller added.\nUnder the plan, new domain names such as \"firm,\" \"arts,\" and \"web\" will be added to the existing top-level domains such as \"com,\" \"net\" and \"org\" starting in the third quarter of 1997, the society said.\nBut online service providers will seek to delay implementation of the plan, officials said. \"It's not ready for prime time,\" one official said. \"We have been approached by other providers, and we're going to try and come up with something.\"\nThe plan establishes an arbitration and mediation procedure for resolving disputes over names, such as when a trademarked name is used in an Internet address.\nSeveral net organizations, along with computer-maker Digital Equipment Corp, telecommunications company MCI Communications Corp and UUNET Technologies Inc., a unit of WorldCom Inc, immediately endorsed the plan, first unveiled in February.\nAny delay would likely please Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions Inc. The company is the sole registration agent for the most popular current domains, including \"com\" and \"net.\"  \nUnder the plan, the domain names registered by Network Solution will be registered jointly by all registration agents once the company's contract with the National Science Foundation expires.\nNetwork Solutions, which has spoent millions of dollars on its set-up, pledged that would never happen. \"We have no intent of opening up our registry to others upon expiration,\" spokesman Christoper Clough said.\nThe Internet Society plan is also opposed by a group that has tried to create on its own informal system of new top-level domains. Less than one percent of the computers that route traffic on the Internet recognize names registered with the informal group, which recently began calling itself the Enhanced Domain Name Service.\nKarl Denninger, the group's founder and president of a small Internet provider in Illinois called MCSNet, pledged to boycott any companies that go along with the Internet Society's plan.\n\"I'm not going to pay anybody who doesn't pay attention to my interests,\" Denninger said. \"You can vote with your wallet.\"\n((--202-898-8312))\n", "Britain's largest life insurance group Prudential Corp said on Wednesday it is to increase its exposure to the top end of the personal financial services market by taking a near 30 percent stake in St James's Place Capital.\nThe move coincides with news that St James' is seeking to buy the 49 percent of life insurer J. Rothschild Assurance (JRA) it does not already own and comes hot on the heels of the Pru's purchase of mutual insurer Scottish Amicable two weeks ago.\nIt is the attraction of JRA, set up by St James's co-founder Sir Mark Weinberg in 1992, and its upmarket clientele which lies behind the Pru's interest in St James's.\nJRA targets high net-worth individuals, managing some 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) for its near 200,000 policyholders.\nIn 1996, the company announced a 41 percent growth in new business, among the highest in the industry.\nDespite assurances from the Pru that it would respect JRA's wishes to stay independent, any future takeover of it or St.James would represent a neat hat-trick for Weinberg.\nIn the 1960s he founded insurance firm Abbey Life, which he later sold to Lloyds Bank. He then set up Allied Dunbar, eventually selling that to B.A.T Industries.\nHowever, the Pru has agreed not to increase its holding in St James's for at least a year, unless the company attracts a bid from a third party.\nThat undertaking was described as \"fundamental\" to the deal by Mike Wilson chief executive of JRA.\nThe Pru will pay around 39.6 million pounds for 30.5 million St James's shares, to add to the 10.4 million shares it already owns.\nScottish Amicable holds approximately 20 percent of JRA which after conversion into St James shares will give the Pru control of 118.8 million shares or 29.9 percent.\n\"Something had to happen to sort out the interest the Pru acquired through ScotAm. This looks an elegant intermediate step but may not be the final solution,\" said one industry analyst.\nThe move gave the Pru strategic options, he said and a purchase of JRA further down the line would not conflict with its existing Prudential or Scottish Amicable brands.\n\"The value would be in keeping it separate. It's a fairly unique organisation and the Pru's chief executive Peter Davis has said in the past that there's nothing wrong with operating separate brands.\"\nSt James said it believed the plans would enable JRA to achieve more rapid growth through improved incentives for the sales force and a simplification of the management structure.\nPlans to float JRA on the stock market, possibly as early as this summer, have been shelved.\nWilson said today's proposals would result in the same benefits for shareholders but at an earlier stage than would otherwise have been possible.\nJRA contributed 11 million pounds towards St James' after tax profits from continuing operations of 25.1 million pounds in the nine months to December 31, 1996, up from 5.5 million pounds for the whole of the previous year.\nSt James said it believed JRA, with its high quality, focused distribution and strong brand name was well placed to take advantage of current developments in the industry.\nLord Rothschild who co-founded St James's with Weinberg, sold half his family's stake for 13.8 million pounds last October following his decision to step down as joint chairman after the group's reconstruction in the summer.\nSt James's also owns Life Assurance Holding Corp which specialises in the acquisition and management of closed life assurance policies and Global Asset Management, a specialist fund management company.

The SFO investigates and prosecutes major financial crimes.\nIMRO's own probe into MGAM has already led to the suspension of two fund managers and briefly saw trading halted in three MGAM funds, which have around 90,000 small investors.\n\"We have been in contact with IMRO. IMRO are investigating and will share anything of relevance with us,\" the SFO spokeswoman told Reuters.\nTrading in the three funds resumed on Thursday after a 180 million pound ($280 million) bail-out by parent company Deutsche Bank.\nSources in both the British banking and fund management industries said the probe appeared to be focusing on links between suspended MGAM fund manager Peter Young and a British-based broker, Fiba Nordic Securities.\nYoung was not immediately available for comment.\nA spokesman for Fiba Nordic Securities in London said the firm welcomed any investigation and denied any improper relationship with MGAM.\nFiba Nordic Securities has been a broker and valuer for funds managed by MGAM.\nBritish regulatory sources said the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) had previously been examining the activities of Fiba over another matter.\nThis had subsequently led to the investigation by IMRO into MGAM which prompted Young's suspension.\nYoung, whose own assets were frozen as a result of a high court injunction late on Wednesday, was suspended from MGAM on Monday. MGAM announced on Wednesday evening that a second manager, Stewart Armer, had also been suspended.\nYoung had managed two of the three suspended funds.\nMGAM said Armer was suspended on Wednesday evening \"following the discovery of a suspected breach of personal account dealing rules\".\nA source close to the investigation said Armer's assets would not be frozen and he was not a central focus of the probe. Armer was not available for comment.\nBut in Frankfurt a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said neither Young nor Armer had committed an obvious breach of regulations. \"But both were hovering on the brink of a grey area,\" spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf told Reuters.\nAccording to sources close to the investigation, the probe is trying to determine whether the fund's investments in unquoted stocks were valued above their real worth.\nBritish brokers said they had had few redemptions in the three funds after trading resumed but the full extent of any exodus would only become apparent after a few weeks.\nThe fall-out from the MGAM investigation spread to Sweden, where Young had invested substantially in unlisted stocks.

Reform won the third most seats in its inaugural national election campaign in 1993, while the Conservatives plummeted to two seats after nine years of rule.\nBut Reform has been haunted by accusations of racism through its 3-1/2 year term in Parliament.\nQuestioned by reporters on Thursday about Reform's record on tolerance, Manning accused the Conservatives of choosing a candidate based on race.\nManning produced a clipping from a Vancouver newspaper, which quoted a Conservative official as saying he deliberately sought election candidates who were not Sikh so the candidate could distinguish himself from the other parties' Sikh candidates.\n\"If we'd said that, we'd be crucified,\" Manning told the National Press Club in Ottawa. He urged the media to challenge the Tories on the comment, but denied he was mudslinging.\n\"I don't like any of that stuff,\" he said.\nA Conservative spokesman brushed off Manning's remarks as \"electioneering.\"\nThe ruling Liberals are widely expected to call an election this weekend for June 2. While recent polls predicted the Liberals would retain power, pre-election campaigning has taken on a bitter flavor, with name-calling and accusations of racism and sexism becoming more frequent.\nLiberal Defence Minister Doug Young was criticised recently for sexist remarks. On Tuesday, Reform member of parliament Ian McClelland called Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps a \"bitch\" in the House of Commons and was forced to withdraw his remark.\nAlso this week, British Columbia Reform official George Rigaux resigned after saying that Sikh leaders were corrupting nominations in his riding. Conservative leader Jean Charest said on Wednesday that voters should be alarmed about charges of racism and sexism surrounding the Reform party.\nThe Conservative and Reform parties are trying to carve out distinct images as they compete for the conservative vote. In trying to portray itself as a grassroots party, Reform has had to fend off a reputation for extremism.\nLast May, Reform members of parliament opposed a Liberal bill to expand rights for homosexuals. One Reform member of parliament said that if he owned a business he would move black or gay employees \"to the back of the shop\" or even fire them if their presence annoyed bigoted customers.\nHis comments were backed by another Reform member of parliament. Both were disciplined by the Reform caucus.\nDuring the 1993 campaign, Reform had to dump a candidate after he acknowledged making anti-immigrant remarks.\n", "There will be more smoke than fire when Philip Morris Cos.

The latest round of talks, in Chicago, ended Monday.\nU.S. regulation of cigarette makers and other non-monetary issues have so far dominated the talks, according to sources. But the Wall Street Journal said Tuesday that rivals of Philip Morris are pushing for lock-step cigarette price increases by all companies to pay for a proposed fund for sick smokers.\nRJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., according to the paper, quoting unnamed sources, is particularly worried that the financially thriving Philip Morris might forgo price increases in order to grab market share from smaller rivals such as No. 2 RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co.\nAnalysts discounted the likelihood of such a pact, saying mutual pricing would violate U.S. antitrust laws and would go against the widespread retail practice of selling all cigarettes within a category at the same price.\n\"There are a thousand different ways other than pricing to get customers to buy your cigarettes,\" said analyst Emanuel Goldman of Paine Webber.\nA spokesman for Philip Morris declined to comment on the talks.\nAt the Philip Morris annual meeting, scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. EDT, activist shareholders are expected to present proposals urging the company to eliminate the suspected carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene from its cigarettes and that outside directors doing substantial business with Philip Morris stay out of meetings setting executives salaries.\nA third shareholder proposal, sponsored by The Sisters of Charity of New York, urges Philip Morris to adopt in developing countries the same limits on marketing cigarettes to young people it has adopted in the United States.\nThe company's board opposes all the proposals.\nOne activist group supporting the proposals, INFACT of Boston, will also have protestors outside the Philip Morris Manufacturing Centre, INFACT executive director Kathryn Mulvey said.\nINFACT played a leading role during the 1970s and 1980s in a boycott of Nestle over alleged mismarketing of infant formula in poor countries and charges Philip Morris with unfair lobbying of government officials.\nINFACT also wants Philip Morris to change its marketing practices in developing countries, she said.\nMulvey said the widely reported, historic talks between cigarette makers and anti-tobacco organisations had had no effect on INFACT's plans to protest.\n\"There's nothing that we've heard ... that has anything to do with marketing to kids in developing countries or influence peddling,\" Mulvey said.\n", "Heavy late-March rains favoured Ivorian mid-crop cocoa harvest prospects as the month's rainfall total edged up to long-term average levels after a February drought, weather and crop analysts said on Monday.\n\"The rains have been very satisfactory lately,\" said a National Weather centre spokesman. \"We are back to around average levels and the rains are continuing into April.\"\nOfficial weather data for the third 10 days of March showed rains at 10 weather stations totalled 742 mm against 208 mm in the previous 10 days. An average of 111 mm fell in March.\nCrop analysts said weather data weighted for plantation density and long term productivity suggested the March rains were in line with a 20-year average of around 105 mm.\nRains falling on average on five out of ten days were spread widely over Ivory Coast's cocoa belt but heaviest falls were in central areas around Daloa, Gagnoa, Yamoussoukro and Abidjan.\n\"Everything now depends on the (mid-crop) pod-count,\" said one drop analyst.\n\"We had good January rains, bad February rains and good March rains. I remain an optimist (for midcrop harvest volumes),\" he added.\nRains during the second ten days of March were heaviest in less productive eastern border areas.\nOtherwise, south-western forest areas, densely planted with productive hybrid trees, have tended to receive the most.\nCrop analysts said in early March that regular showers up to April would determine how close this year's mid-crop would be to the bumper 200,000 tonnes in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) harvest season.\nThe 1996/97 mid-crop could exceed 150,000 tonnes if rains were sufficient, one said, adding that harvest predictions would be reviewed in April when pods on trees gave a better idea of yields.\nThe data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the third 10 days of March in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days in brackets):\nDaloa 105.8 (2.7), Gagnoa 142.8 (20.2), San Pedro 18.3 (12.6), Tabou 1.0 (21) Man 98.7 (2.0), Dimbokro 73.2 (32.3), Yamoussoukro 83.8 (0), Abidjan 128.8 (8.9), Sassandra 10.6 (8.8), Adiake 64.5 (13.9), Korhogo 14.2 (0).\n--Abidjan Newsroom + 225 21 90 90\n", "Far East metals traders were preoccupied with one question on Monday -- will China buy copper in the midst of the current rally, or are prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) nearing precarious heights?\nThere was little doubt in the minds of most traders and industry sources polled by Reuters that copper prices would continue their heady rise.  \nCopper on the LME finished Friday trading substantially higher, with technical buying and aggressive short covering taking the red metal to fresh 8-1/2 months highs despite an unexpected stocks increase of 1,875 tonnes.\nIt was $2,366 a tonne at the afternoon kerb close, off the day's $2,375 high but up $38 from Thursday's finish.\nPrices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) have been mirroring the LME's rises since trading resumed last week after the long Lunar New Year holiday.  \nShanghai copper futures started higher on Monday, with the most active May 1997 contract opening at 23,500 yuan ($2,831) a tonne, rising 190 yuan from last week's close.

In a statement issued on Friday, it \"energetically\" condemned all violations carried out against civic leaders in the area.\n\"BP is involved in a conspiracy of silence and should take a more active stance in favor of human rights ... it may be that BP staff have a direct liability in these actions or it may not be the case,\" Howitt, a member of the Euro-Parliament South American affairs delegation, told a news conference.\n\"But I find it impossible to believe that BP managers are not aware of these human rights abuses committed in their name if not by them directly,\" he added.\nThe claims against BP were fueled by a series of articles in the British press in the last year based on a multi-agency report drawn up in 1995. That report documented the murders of seven peasant or social leaders, most of whom had protested against BP's operations in the area since they began in 1991.\nBP is not mentioned by name in the report's conclusions, and the killings were attributed to paramilitaries and the army.\nA statement issued by BP Thursday said: \"BP rejects energetically human rights abuses from whatever quarter and has publicly condemned the deaths of civic leaders and others in Casanare.\"\n\"BP categorically rejects the accusations made by Howitt. He has a great responsibility to make sure that these claims are fully founded,\" it added.\nBPX head John Doust asked Colombia's Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso to investigate the claims fully to show it had nothing to hide. Valdivieso opened an inquiry last month but told Doust in a letter that he had no grounds to suspect any wrongdoing by the British company.\nHowitt also accused BP of failing to spend enough on the local community in Casanare. BP figures show it spent more than $17 million between 1991 and 1996 on social, education, education, environmental and infrastructure programs.\n", "If Miss Manners, the nation's arbiter of proper taste and decorum, can find good things to say about car dealers, then the industry must be doing something right.\nThat was the message John Peterson, outgoing president of the National Automobile Dealers Association, delivered on Saturday in a speech that railed against the media and others who say traditional car dealerships are on the way out.\n\"It's time we stood up for what our industry is doing right out there,\" said Peterson. \"So, to our friends in the media, I say take a tip from one of your own, Miss Manners, and park that old stereotype of fast-talking salesmen in plaid coats and white bucks.\"\nAccording to Peterson, Miss Manners, whose real name is Judith Martin, wrote a column in 1996 after she shopped for a new car in which she said she was \"astonished\" at the \"dignified courtesy\" she found at a dozen dealerships she visted.\nPeterson spoke at the opening day of the NADA's 80th annual convention and equipment exposition.\nIn his remarks, Peterson acknowledged the traditional dealer franchise system is facing numerous challenges from the explosive growth of used car superstores such as CarMax and AutoNation USA.\nBut he said traditional franchised dealers will remain the dominant system for selling new cars and trucks. In a year when the superstores grew rapidly, Peterson said franchised dealers boosted sales by three percent, increased profits by 25 percent, and finished the year with 23,000 dealerships in operation.\nOf the approximately 15 million new light vehicles expected to be sold in 1997, 14.5 million will be sold by the current franchise system.\nPeterson also took issue with critics who say car dealers do not respond to customers, saying a recent survey by the Newspaper Association of America indicated that more than 90 percent of new-vehicle buyers are satisified or very satisfied.\n\"No business is more poked at, picked at, anaylzed, written about and castigated for failing to live up to performance standards that no other business in the country is expected to meet,\" said Peterson.\nIn the NADA's keynote speech, Toyota Motor Corp's top executive in the U.S. told the audience that franchised new-car dealers will continue to be the cornerstone of the U.S. automotive retailing industry.\nYale Gieszel, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc, said consumers -- and not auto superstores -- are driving the changes rocking the business.\n\"Large retail chains or automobile department stores are not the answer to the challenges we face. The current franchise system will not only survive, it will flourish,\" he said.\nAt a news conference afterward, Gieszel said he does not believe the large superstore chains can reap enough economies of scale that they can outperform local franchises. Gieszel also said Toyota is not convinced the large superstores can offer the close customer attention that individual dealers can.\n", "Strippers can dance naked in Canada as long as they keep their distance from the customers.\nExotic dancers on Thursday cheered a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that bans lap dancing, but club owners warned it would turn off customers and put some establishments out of business.\n\"I think it's great. Dancing is for seeing, not touching,\" said a dancer at Filmores, a well-known Toronto strip club.\nCanada's top court ruled on Wednesday that lap dancing -- sitting naked on a customer's lap and rubbing against him -- was indecent and a criminal act.\nAndy, a lunchtime patron at the Zanzibar strip club on Toronto's seedy Yonge Street, said the court ban was unnecessary.\n\"The only thing criminal about it is if prostitution is involved. Some girls just take it too far,\" said the apprentice electrician as a dancer gyrated on the stage behind him.\nCanada's lap-dance brouhaha began in 1994 when an Ontario judge ruled that a variety of sexual acts at a Toronto strip club did not offend community standards.\nAfter the ruling, lap dancing quickly spread to other clubs across the country.\nA former stripper, Katharine Goldberg, led a public crusade against lap dancing, arguing that some dancers were forced by club owners to masturbate customers and perform other acts.\n\"This should end the suffering of so many young women and protect the health and lives of many people,\" Goldberg said.\nBut Canadian newspapers have quoted other strippers who resented Goldberg's potrayal of them as sex slaves. Most customers obeyed the no-touch rule and it was more lucrative than table dancing, they said.\nA lap dance can cost up to $20 each with some dancers taking home between $300 and $500 a night.\nThe Supreme Court upheld an appeal court decision that overturned the original 1994 court ruling. The appeals judge said lap dancing degraded dancers and encouraged clients to treat women as sexual objects.\n", "Polaris Industries Inc., best known for its snowmobiles, said Wednesday it will begin building motorcycles, riding its small-engine expertise into a market no major U.S. company other than Harley-Davidson Inc. has dared test in 40 years.\nMinneapolis-based Polaris said it is developing a highway cruiser motorcycle that will be named Victory and be available to consumers in the spring of 1998.\n\"We've built pretty much all of it from scratch. The engine was designed in the USA and it's going to be made in the USA,\" said Matt Parks, who will be general manager of the new Polaris motorcycles unit.\nPolaris is the world's largest maker of snowmobiles and is among the world's top three makers of all-terrain vehicles, or ATVs, and personal watercraft.\n\"We've competed successfully against Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Suzuki in our other businesses. ... Entering the motorcycle market is a logical extension of our diversification strategy,\" said Polaris Chief Executive Officer Hall Wendel.\nShares in Polaris rose 37.5 cents to $26.25 on the New York Stock Exchange trading.\nBesides the legendary Harley-Davidson, there are only two other, much smaller U.S. motorcycle makers -- Salt Lake City-based ATK America Inc., a maker of specialised off-road machines, and Buell Motorcycle Co., which is 49 percent owned by Milwaukee-based Harley and also located in Wisconsin.\nPolaris said its new cruiser will compete with Harley's machines, as well as similar bikes from Honda and others. The company declined to disclose price or design specifications.\n\"It seems there is a market opportunity,\" said Beth Burnson, an industry analyst at the ABN-AMRO Chicago Corp brokerage and investment bank here.\nIn recent years, Harley has been unable to make enough cruiser motorcycles to meet booming demand, leaving a hole in the market, Burnson said.\n\"Japanese companies have been able come up with Harley copycats that people will buy off the showroom floor if they don't want to wait two years for a Harley. That's the part of the market that Polaris can target,\" Burnson said.\nPolaris said it expects its existing customers -- an estimated 30 percent of whom are motorcyclists already -- will be among early buyers. The worldwide market for cruiser motorcycles is estimated at over 200,000 units annually, and sales of cruiser motorcycles have nearly doubled in the last five years, Polaris said.\nWith personal watercraft sales expected to slump this year due to overstocking in 1996, and snowmobile sales flat, Polaris has relied for growth recently on strong ATV sales, said Scott Ciccarelli, an analyst at the Gerard Klauer Mattison brokerage and investment bank in New York.\nChallenging Harley, against which it has never competed, may be tough for Polaris, but moving into motorcycles is a logical next step for the company, he said.\n\"They've been hinting toward this for the last two years or so,\" Ciccarelli said.\nEngines for Polaris products are presently built in-house or by Japan's Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., which makes Subaru-brand cars, or by a Fuji-Polaris joint venture, Robin Manufacturing, in Hudson, Wis.\nEngines for the new motorcycles will be built at the Polaris engine plant in Osceola, Wis., and the motorcycles will be manufactured at the company's Spirit Lake, Iowa, plant, the company said.\nOn Feb. 4, Polaris reported 1996 sales of $1.19 billion, up 7 percent from $1.11 billion in 1995. Annual profits were $62.3 million, up 2 percent over the previous year. Polaris said it expected 1997 sales to decline from the 1996 level but still show another year of record-setting profits.\n\"Expenses related to the development of the company's motorcycles are reflected in its expectations for 1997 net income in excess of 1996's record level,\" Polaris said.\n", "Talk of a merger between the Airbus European passenger plane venture and U.S. aerospace giant Lockheed Martin was premature but the two groups do have interests which would benefit from a link up, Airbus's French partner said on Saturday.\n\"It's premature,\" Aerospatiale vice president for corporate communications Patrice Kreis said when asked about a report in the London Times newspaper which said Airbus Industrie and Lockheed Martin were in merger talks.\n\"Airbus's interests and Lockheed's interests are to merge (eventually),\" he said, in the face of a pending merger by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The merged Boeing-McDonnell group \"want not only to dominate the market but to take it over completely,\" he said.\nBut it was too early to talk about linking up Airbus with Lockheed as European aerospace and defence companies needed to consolidate among themselves, before tackling a transatlantic merger, he said. \"There's a lot of work to do,\" he added.\nAmong the key steps to be taken are current moves to changing Airbus's partnership into a limited liability company. But that should occur in the context of a rationalisation of European civil and military aviation, space and weapons systems, he said.\n\"Airbus on its own will not survive. Everything is linked -- civilian aircraft, military aircraft, space and weapons systems,\" he said. The creation in the United States of titans such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, which embrace all these sectors, is forcing Europe to do the same.\nThe European consolidation would be through changes in capital at the parent-company level rather than cooperation on specific projects favoured in the past.\nImportant steps are being taken in France in the restructuring, with a merger of state-owned Aerospatiale and combat-plane maker Dassault Aviation, and the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF, both due to be realised this year.\nAerospatiale's chairman Yves Michot has said he was talking to Lockheed to collaborate with Airbus on specific projects.\nLockheed could become a partner in the crucial Airbus project to build a 555-seater plane, the A3XX, to rival Boeing's monopoly of the large capacity segment with its 747 jumbo.\nAerospatiale had no comment on the timing of any Lockheed decision to join the A3XX project, which has already signed up Italy's Alenia, part of the Finmecanicca group, and Saab of Sweden as potential risk-sharing partners.\nLockheed Martin and Aerospatiale both have interests in civil and military aircraft -- Lockheed makes fuselages for Boeing passenger planes, makes large military transports, and is also a prime contractor for the U.S. new-generation F22 fighter.\nAerospatiale makes Airbus cockpit systems and assembles the planes at its plant in Toulouse, southwestern France. It is also a key partner in the planned European Future Large Aircraft (FLA) military transport.\nBritish Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG and Casa of Spain are the other Airbus partners working on changing it to an integrated company by 1999.\n", "British household products group Reckitt and Colman Plc reported an 11 percent rise in 1996 pretax profits to 316.5 million pounds ($505.5 million) on Thursday, saying the underlying performance of the group remained solid.\nIn an interview, chief executive Vernon Sankey said the group expected to see similar growth rates in sales and earnings in 1997.\nBut the company's shares slipped 3p to 782p as the figures came in right in the middle of brokers' forecast range.\nHousehold products, comprising 80 percent of group turnover, posted a nine percent increase in trading profit to 283.9 million. Earnings from the pharmaceutical division grew 12.2 percent to 67.2 million.\nThe company benefitted from 27 million of savings from its integration of L&amp;F Products in North America, which it acquired for one billion pounds in 1994. Lysol, America's best selling disinfectant, increased its market share across the range.\nThe lavatory care category grew by 18.1 percent in Africa and the Middle East, and most of the countries in Latin America showed double digit growth with Harpic. Floor care products in Latin America achieved record sales, driving the group's regional market share up to 49.5 percent.\nBut economic conditions in Europe continued to be tough and sales overall were flat although margins improved, said the company.\n\"Mainland Europe has been relatively flat for most of 1996 and I think it's too early to say Europe is turning around. There are some reasonable signs. France and germany are still very tough,\" said Sankey.\nThe strategy is working, he said, which remains to focus on number one and number two brands with global potential, use the group's wide geographic base and expand in developing markets.\nAbout one third of Reckitt's business comes from North America, one third in Europe, a third from the the rest of the world. Some 26 percent of business comes from developing markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nIf sterling remains at its current high levels on foreign exchange markets it would hit Reckitt by some 20 million on translation next year, Sankey said.\nReckitt shares have risen by 14 percent in recent weeks amid market rumours that the company may fall victim to a takeover bid by Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever.\nBut many analysts now think the bid premium makes the company too expensive as a takeover target.\nSankey dismissed speculation that Unilever Plc would bid for Reckitt as just rumour, saying the company has not been approached by Unilever.\n\"It's a rumour and we have had rumours for years. We get rumours everyday, now quite frankly that is it,\" said Sankey.\nThe company declared a total dividend payout of 21.97 pence per share up from 20.15 pence. Including the foreign income dividend it was increased to 23.37p.\n($ = 0.626 British Pounds)\n", "Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL) is busy handling one of its most difficult and dangerous cargoes - live snakes, HACTL's general operations manager, Tony Morris said.\nAs Hong Kong temperatures dip, up to five tons of mainly cobras and pit vipers are daily arriving by air to become snake soup, snake stew and snake wine. Rows of wire baskets outside restaurants are full of snakes awaiting their fate.\nThe Chinese swear by the medicinal qualities of snake gall bladder cut out of a live snake and swigged down with a glass of brandy to ward off winter flu as well as other snake delicacies, Morris told Reuters in an interview.\nBut the snakes pose a particular handling problem for the Hong Kong authorities as they are sometimes used to smuggle drugs, Morris explained. A popular method of smuggling heroin is to drug the snake with smoke, make a small cut in its skin and sew the heroin inside.\nAll snake imports from breeding farms in Thailand and mainland China are scrutinised by hand in two specially equipped inspection rooms at HACTL. The brown hessian sacks packed in wooden crates with breathing holes are dumped into a big wire basket from which each snake is pulled to be carefully examined for hidden contraband.\n\"It wouldn't be everyone's favourite occupation but the customs officers treat it as an everyday job and actually seem to enjoy it,\" Morris said. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017\n", "General Motors Corp. was expected to seek bids for its Hughes Electronics Corp. defence businesses in the first of several transactions aimed at shedding GM's remaining non-automotive assets, analysts said Thursday.\nThe possible sale of Hughes' defence operations for as much as $8 billion was the latest of several scenarios that have emerged in recent months regarding GM's plans for Hughes, which it bought in 1985 for about $5 billion.\n\"I think the GM board and Hughes Electronics management are very interested in divesting the defence business, merging the Delco Electronics unit with the Delphi components business, and spinning off the communications business into a separate company,\" said CS First Boston defence analyst Peter Aseritis.\n\"My sense is that they want to find a merger partner for the defence business first,\" he added.\nAnalysts said several candidates could be interested in Hughes' defence units, including McDonnell Douglas Corp., Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp.\nGM declined to comment on the idea of splitting off the defence business, first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\"I have to classify it all in the realm of speculation, for which we have no comment,\" said GM spokeswoman Toni Simmonetti in New York.\nHowever, GM disclosed in recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings that Hughes wants to \"strengthen its leadership position through acquisitions, consolidations, realignments and divestitures,\" among other actions.\nHughes' missile systems, radar, electronic warfare, thermal imaging, information systems and other defence units, which earned operating profits of $688 million on revenues of $5.95 billion in 1995, are regarded as attractive plums in a consolidating defence industry.\nMcDonnell Douglas, which many analysts said was ready for an acquisition, declined to confirm any specific bidding activity, but said it was interested in Hughes. McDonnell President Harry Stonecipher \"has gone on record saying that he is interested in making an acquisition. He finds Hughes an interesting choice,\" a McDonnell spokeswoman said.\nBut analysts cautioned that any transaction involving Hughes would be complicated, because of tax considerations for GM and its Class H shareholders.\nUnder a complex ownership structure, shareholders of GM Class H stock are entitled to dividends based on Hughes' earnings while GM owns the subsidiary's assets. Thus an outrightright sale would create a major tax liability for GM.\nFor that reason, analysts said GM was more likely to pursue a non-cash transaction, such as a stock swap or other type of deal that could take some time to structure.\n\"Clearly I would personally be surprised if there was an outright sale,\" said BT Securities analyst Wolfgang Demisch.\nA sale of the defence business would clear the way for GM to fold its Delco Electronics unit, which makes audio systems and other components, back into its Delphi Automotive Systems auto parts unit.\nThat would leave Hughes' lucrative telecommunications and space segment, which has been soaring on the growth of its DirecTV satellite broadcasting service. Those operations may be spun off into a separate company, analysts said.\n", "Cigarette companies fighting lawsuits in Florida are being haunted in courtrooms by best-selling novelist John Grisham's \"Runaway Jury,\" a tale of jury manipulation at a tobacco trial.\nIn \"Runaway Jury,\" a tobacco industry operative commissions a burglary and other crimes as part of a juror-tampering campaign.\nThe novel's title has become shorthand for anti-tobacco lawyers who are concerned that life might imitate art -- something that angers the lawyers representing tobacco firms.\n\"We are up here and having to defend against a fictitious novel, and I don't know why,\" attorney Ed Moss of Brown &amp; Williamson said on Monday at a Miami hearing before a class-action suit against cigarette makers. \"This is ridiculous.\"\n\"We have not and will not go out and investigate the jurors,\" Moss said.\nMoss, speaking for Brown, a unit of B.A.T. Industries of Britain, and eight other tobacco companies, pledged to Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye that the tobacco companies would not use private investigators, jury experts or researchers in selecting jurors in the class-action suit.\nSuch techniques, while costly, are legal and are frequently used in high-profile U.S. trials in the belief that the backgrounds of jurors determine likely votes on legal issues. Investigators hunt out information about jurors that might allow them to be barred from hearing a case.\nAnti-tobacco lawyers repeatedly assert that tobacco companies, with their deep ranks of lawyers and strong financial resources, can easily outmatch them in jury selection.\nThere was no evidence of any improper juror investigations by tobacco companies at any time, Moss said.\nPotential jurors for an individual lawsuit starting on Monday against RJR Nabisco RJ Reynolds Tobacco in Jacksonville, Florida, were also being asked whether or not they had read \"Runaway Jury\", published last year by Doubleday and on the best-seller lists for months.\nAnd lawyers pressing a third case, the State of Florida's lawsuit to recover medical spending on sick smokers, have also complained in court hearings about potential pressures by tobacco companies on jurors.\nLawyer Stanley Rosenblatt, pressing the Miami class-action suit on behalf of Norma Broin and an estimated 60,000 other sick, non-smoking flight attendants, said the tobacco companies were capable of shaping a jury through those outside means.\nHe welcomed Moss's pledge to rely only on a written questionnaire and in-court inquiries to select jurors for the scheduled June 2 trial.\nBut Rosenblatt also urged Kaye to keep secret the names of all potential jurors and, as an added safeguard, to identify jurors only by number during a trial expected to last eight to 12 weeks.\n", "The French government is moving edgily towards a key decision for the future of Europe's defence industry -- whether to privatise defence electronics group Thomson-CSF through a public sale or private placement.\nThe stakes are huge, as the choice of the method of sale will to a large extent determine the final outcome of a far-reaching restructuring in the French defence industry and has major implications for the entire sector in Europe.\nLike a master chess player, the state must look several moves ahead, decide what sort of defence industry it wants to see in a few years' time, and ensure the decision will be seen as fair to all involved.\nGovernment sources said on Friday that the decision, originally expected at the end of January, would probably slip into early February because the government was studying in great detail all the elements of the politically-sensitive dossier that involves Europe's biggest defence electronics company.\n\"The decision will be taken shortly, but not today. We are still studying all possibilities,\" said an official source.\n\"The decision will have to be taken by the cabinet. At the moment there is no proposal to send to the ministers. I could not tell you when exactly that will happen,\" he added.\nPrime Minister Alain Juppe is anxious to avoid another embarassment like the one he suffered on December 4 when the government had to suspend an earlier privatisation plan under which Thomson-CSF would have gone to conglomerate Lagardere Groupe.\nThat deal involved the privatisation of the Thomson group, which included both a 68 percent stake in Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).\nThe state was forced to call off the plan because the independent privatisation commission balked at the terms of a sale of TMM to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.\nThe cancellation outraged the Korean, who called the decision racist and prompted an angry call for explanation from President Kim Young-sam.\nSince then the French government has decided to separate the sales of TMM and Thomson-CSF.\nThe ultimate aim of the government is to have a strong defence industry able to supply its armed forces with state-of-the art weaponry and play a leading role in Europe and on the world scene.\nA year ago, President Jacques Chirac announced a wide-ranging restructuring of the French defence industry around a merged group of Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation for aerospace, and Thomson-CSF for electronics.\nIn France alone, any such restructuring would affect the business of Lagardere, owner of Matra Espace Defense with British Aerospace Plc as a partner, Alcatel Alsthom and its ally GEC Plc, and smaller groups such as Sagem and Compagnie des Signaux.\nWith a public sale through a market float, Thomson-CSF management will have its hands free to pursue its own negotiations about future alliances while interested partners can acquire stakes on the market.\nBut this may mean that a foreign cash-rich group from elsewhere in Europe or from the U.S. or Asia could buy itself into the talks.\nWith a private placement there are two main options.\nOne is by choosing candidates for a sale using a \"cahier de charges\" -- a sort of bidding book comprising price, intended strategy and commitments on jobs and investments.\nThis would leave the government with the biggest influence on the outcome, but also with the biggest responsibilty.\nAnother procedure, rare in France, would be to auction the state's 68-percent stake in Thomson-CSF among qualified bidders, putting the emphasis on price and ensuring the greatest possible revenues for the state at a time France is trying to reduce its public deficits ahead of monetary union.\n", "Plans to build cocoa factories in Ivory Coast will take national processing capacity to 360,000 tonnes in 1997/98 (Oct-Sept), in line with a target of 500,000 tonnes by 2000, Ivory Coast's commodities minister said on Friday.\n\"If you take into account Cargill, Touton, Cemoi, STF-CI, Orebi and Shanghai we will reach 360,000 tonnes in 1997/98,\" commodities minister Guy-Alain Gauze told Reuters on Friday, referring to chocolate processors' plans to build factories.\nGauze was speaking after a meeting on Friday with the world chocolate trade body OICCC (Office International du Cacao, du Chocolat et de la Confiserie) on cocoa quality and supply.\nIvory Coast is the world's largest cocoa exporter and aims to process 50 percent of its annual crop buy the year 2000.

We have put our money in (to factories),\" said Harrison, adding that Ivory Coast was well placed as a supplier to benefit from stabilising or declining cocoa production in other major producing countries, such as Brazil and Indonesia.\nBut he pointed to an ageing population in Europe, health concerns over chocolate and stricter advertising rules which he said threatened future demand in some regions.\n\"People are having fewer children, and children are big consumers,\" he added. \"We are spending a lot of money to protect ourselves.\"\nHe said producer country concerns over use of up to five percent non-cocoa fat in chocolate in Europe was a minor issue next to public perception of chocolate as a \"product which makes you fat and makes your teeth fall out.\"\nGauze has fought European plans to allow non-cocoa fat usage, putting resulting demand for beans at between 60,000 tonnes and 200,000 tonnes.\nIvory Coast fears a fall in cocoa usage would hit its bean and processed product exports -- a view not shared by some chocolate manufacturers in Europe and the United States.\n\"Future demand for chocolate is goind to come in a wider and wider range of products,\" he added, saying that the OICCC did not have a common position on use of non-cocoa fats.\nOverall cocoa consumption was rising despite use of synthetic and vegetable substitutes for cocoa fats, he added.\n--Abidjan newsroom,  +225 21 90 90\n", "Banking analysts said on Friday that Lloyds TSB Group Plc's 52 percent headline rise in 1996 pretax profits was rather flattering and expressed some concern for future income growth.\nThe pretax profit figure of 2.505 billion stg was just above top expectations although these had been expected to be bettered after some components of the group -- Lloyds Abbey Life and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester -- recently reported higher than expected gains.\n\"There's nothing really wrong with the results,\" said John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. \"But they are not as glorious as they look on the surface.\"\nAnalysts pointed out that the large drop in bad debt provisions -- 44 percent down to 327 million stg -- was a surprise, even though improvement was expected given the fact that the bank has increased higher quality assets such as mortgages.\nLeonard and Panmure Gordon analyst David Poutney said they would likely not be increasing their profit forcasts for 1997 which stand at 2.825 billion stg and 2.940 billion stg respectively.\nBut Poutney, who has been advising clients to hold the shares but take profits, said he was now a seller.\n\"Overall, they are good figures but then it comes down to the valuation of the shares,\" Poutney said, \"and they are looking a bit expensive.

The float is clearly held up by the process of the litigation. Once the litigation is resolved, the board will meet and make decisions about how the float should proceed.\n\"The timetable for this year is still very much our desire,\" Switkowski said.\nHowever, Switkowski said there was a possibility Optus's planned float would clash with the timing of the sale of one-third of the government-owned Telstra Corp, Australia's biggest carrier, which is seen by analysts as a far bigger capital-raising operation than for Optus.\n\"It is not impossible that those floats will happen about the same time, we will see later this year,\" he said.\nSwitkowski would not comment on the litigation battle which, if Optus loses, could see it forced to sell its Vision stake at a discount to Seven.\nOptus Communications has pumped about A$605 million into Optus Vision, which is currently rolling out its cable network to 2.5 million homes or 40 percent of Australian households at a cost of about A$3.0 billion.\nThe full deregulation of the Australian telecommunications industry on July 1, 1997, would pressure margins, Jacobs said.\n\"There is no doubt that there will be erosion in some areas of our business as competition comes in...but we fully expect that erosion of (market) share would be more than offset by the continued growth of the business,\" Jacobs said.\nAustralian telecommunications analysts welcomed the result, but described post-deregulation as a \"big unknown\" for Optus.\n\"The rest of this year looks all right, but the big question mark is next year, with all the new players coming into the market.

National Express was up 26 pence at 547 and FirstBus was up 12 1/2 pence at 241.\nThe sector has seen spectacular growth in share prices in the past year as more bus operators have moved into railways, taking advantage of the opportunities opened up by privatisation.\n($1=.6172 Pound)\n", "China looks likely to slow the pace of reform in its financial markets, the late Deng Xiaoping's most startling experiment, as his successors make stability their top priority this year, analysts said on Sunday.\nChina's leaders already have enough on their plates -- the return of Hong Kong from July 1, the ruling Communist Party's 15th Congress later in the year and task of consolidating their power in the aftermath of Deng's death last Wednesday.\nBold and ambitious new reforms in the financial sector are unlikely to occur before these more pressing items are out of the way, but pressure to move ahead will build during the year, the analysts said.\n\"I think for the coming months up to the Party Congress, the intention will be to keep things tight,\" said one European banker. \"But once the congress is out of the way, they will want to speed it up again.\"\nAn analyst working with a Shanghai brokerage said the authorities could be expected to be cautious on issuing new regulations and initiating new changes in the foreseeable future, but added: \"The main policy will not change.\"\n\"The development of the stock market will not change despite the news (of Deng's death),\" said one trader. \"But to maintain the stability of the market, the government will not announce any big changes in the immediate future.\"\nThe chance of a roll-back in the overall trend towards bigger, more sophisticated and regulated financial markets seems even more unlikely.\nChina's stock, futures and capital markets sprang out of Deng's comment in the early 1990s that capitalist-style markets might be worth trying.\n\"If, after one or two years of experimentation, they prove feasible, we can expand them. Otherwise, we can put a stop to them and be done with it,\" Deng said.\nBut as Deng probably guessed when he said it, once the markets' juggernaut got under way, it was probably impossible to do much more than guide it.\n\"The markets are still experimental to some extent, but closing them down is less and less of an option as time passes,\" the banker said.\nThe Beijing leadership is faced with a host of pressing issues related to the financial markets.\nThe markets are still waiting for the release of the long-delayed Securities Law, Futures Law and Investment Fund Law, all basic building blocks of the financial industry.\nForeign bankers and insurers are impatient about the snail's pace at which China's financial sector is being opened up.\nThe futures markets are so constrained by policy that they are scarcely able to fulfil their function -- the hedging of risk, traders say.\nStock brokers complain about the bureaucratic way in which companies are chosen for listing, resulting in too many poor quality firms being listed too slowly.\nAnd the huge problem of heavily indebted state-owned enterprises is still there waiting to be resolved.\n\"The need is there, there is an enormous need to address the issues,\" the banker said. \"But the political situation has not been stable enough for people to attack the knotty decisions.\"\n\"Stability is the top requirement for now. Any sign of weakness could trigger something unexpected,\" he added.\n", "Federal regulators and television broadcasters Thursday moved closer to agreeing on a stepped-up timetable for TV stations to begin providing high-definition digital broadcasts within 18 to 24 months.\nThe issue has been a stumbling block in the Federal Communications Commission's plans to dole out to stations free digital TV licenses in the next two weeks. The new service promises crystal-clear pictures and CD-quality sound.\nUnder pressure to jump-start the digital age, the National Association of Broadcasters and another industry group, the Association for Maximum Service Television, proposed that 31 stations in the 10 largest metropolitan areas begin broadcasting digital signals in 18 to 24 months.\nIn some markets, up to four stations would be on the air in the shortened time frame. The top 10 markets include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and other cities.\nBroadcasters previously had suggested more time was needed, with many stations saying it would take six years to install the needed equipment and put the digital signals on the air.\n\"I welcome the increased level of commitment for launching digital television,\" said Commissioner Susan Ness, who is trying to broker a pact between the FCC and the broadcasters. She said the broadcasters' plans \"move the ball forward in a very substantial manner.\"\nFCC officials stressed, however, that key details must be worked out -- in particular, how many digital broadcasts would begin over 18 to 21 months, something that is important to TV makers trying to offer digital sets in the key Christmas buying season. Twenty-four months would fall after Christmas 1998.\nTV set makers have said they would postpone offering digital sets an extra year if stations delayed significant introduction of digital broadcasts until 1999.\nNess, as a result, said she has asked broadcasters to better detail TV stations' plans to be offering digital transmission by Christmas of next year.\nThe roll-out schedule has been a key hurdle. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt had proposed that big network-owned stations in the top 10 markets start providing digital signals within the next year. That would translate into 26 large stations.\nBroadcasters said that was too quick. Hundt's office gave the broadcasters' latest plan a cautiously upbeat response.\n\"We're evaluting it. But obviously this is a very healthy dialogue between us and the industry,\" said Hundt's chief of staff, Blair Levin.\nEarlier this week Hundt sharply criticised broadcasters, questioning their commitment to digital TV.\n\"I'm beginning to wonder if broadcasters really want these licenses,\" Hundt told a meeting of the National Cable Television Association in New Orleans. \"A cynic would think that broadcasters just don't want someone else to have them.\"\nAn official in Commissioner James Quello's office endorsed the new proposal as an \"agressive roll-out.\" Officials with Commissioner Rachelle Chong's office could not be reached for comment.\nMeanwhile, the FCC still must determine the level of public-interest obligations to impose on TV stations in exchange for the digital licenses, as well as other issues.\n", "British pay television giant BSkyB Plc, a key part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp international media empire, on Thursday staked its claim to a lead role in the development of digital television in the UK.\n\"Our clear and unambiguous aim is to be in the vanguard of the digital era,\" BSkyB deputy managing director David Chance told a Financial Times conference on New Media and Broadcasting.\nBSkyB, the leading force in British pay television with some 5.5 million subscribers, plans to launch 200-channel digital satellite services into the UK later this year.\nBSkyB, one of the corporate success stories of the 1990s in Britain, is 40 percent owned by Murdoch's News Corp.\nMurdoch this week threw down the gauntlet to U.S. cable companies when News Corp sealed an alliance with EchoStar Communications Corp to offer satellite services to compete with the cable providers.\nThe venture, expected to operate under the American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB) name, will offer as many as 500 channels of digital TV, Internet services and local broadcast TV signals to markets across the United States.\nNews Corp also has important satellite television operations in Asia, such as Star TV and JSkyB, a joint venture in Japan which is expected to begin full service next year.\nBack in Britain, BSkyB is also seeking to expand into digital terrestrial television (DTT).\nIt has joined forces with UK commercial television giants Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc to apply for licences to run DTT services.\nTheir British Digital Broadcasting consortium faces competition from DTN, owned by Nasdaq-listed cable company International CableTel, for three key DTT licences.\nBritain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) is expected to announce a decision on the licences around May.\nDTT, broadcast from land-based transmitters to standard television aerials, is expected to begin in mid-1998 and offer a total of around 30 channels.\nChance said that he hoped that neither UK nor European regulators would oppose British Digital Broadcasting if it were awarded the DTT licences.\n\"Eight years ago we led Europe in multi-channel TV,\" Chance said. \"We are probably the last in Europe to launch a digital platform...It isn't the time for a handbrake to be applied.\"\n\"We are behind and we need to get on with it.\"\nDigital television offers extra channels, improved sound and picture quality and the potential to access interactive services such as home shopping and home banking.\nA digital set-top box or decoder is required to view digital channels and a rooftop dish is required to pick up the satellite version. Cable companies are also planning a move to digital.\nDigital take-up has been slow in a number of countries, notably in Germany, Europe's largest television market.\nChance said that for digital to succeed it must offer attractive programming at affordable prices and be simple for viewers to understand and use.

The dividend rose to 3.06 pence from 2.7 pence the preceding year.\nExecutive chairman Gregory Hutchings said the results marked \"another period of outperformance for Tomkins\" and forecast the the shares should continue to outperform the sector.\nHutchings ruled out the possibility of returning the company's 366 million pound cash-pile to shareholders this year, saying in an interview: \"We see sufficient (acquisition) opportunities to hold onto our cash for the time being.\"\nHutchings said the group was likely to make a number of smaller buys. \"It won't be one major deal, but it could be worth up to 200 million pounds,\" he said.\nRumours of a buyback in 1997 have helped push Tomkins shares ahead in recent weeks. Its shares on Monday reversed early gains, however, and were down four at 273-1/2p by 1115 GMT.\n\"The numbers were at the top end of what people were looking for and we've seen some early interest,\" one market-maker said. Analysts had expected profits of around 160 million pounds.\nThe outlook was also seen as promising.\n\"Prospects for the second half look encouraging, with the majority of our operations having healthy order books and satisfactory market conditions,\" Hutchings said.\nHe said Tomkins was delighted with its purchase last year of U.S. automotive and industrial product firm Gates Corp for $1.1 billion.\nGates contributed 259.5 million in sales and 20 million in profit in its first 14 weeks under Tomkins control.\nA divisional breakdown of the Tompkins figures showed fluid controls had sales of 189.2 million versus 165.7 million pounds, with profits of 19 million versus 15.8 million.\nIndustry services saw sales rise to 219 million from 194 million, with profits of 12.5 million versus 12.1 million. Professional garden and leisure products saw sales of 276 million versus 271 million and profits down to 8.5 million from 8.9 million.\nIndustrial products sales rose to 317.3 million from 267.9 million, with profits of 34.3 million versus 28.5 million.\nMilling and baking, which includes the Hovis bread brand, saw sales up to 351.3 million versus 333.8 million, with profits at 15.4 million versus 13.7 million.\nFood products, including Bisto gravy and Robertson's jam range, saw sales up to 543.5 million from 501.8 million, with profits at 42.6 million versus 38.5 million.\nExcluding currency effects, organic growth in group operating profit was up more than 10 percent on sales, which in turn rose by seven percent.\nUnlike other major export groups, Tomkins has so far been left unscathed by the pound powering ahead against the dollar and mark.\nAgainst the dollar, Tomkins said it was locked at $1.52 to the pound for the rest of the year. The amount of mark-denominated business was minimal, it said.\nOn market conditions, Tomkins said the U.S. was seen remaining firm. Britain was described as mixed, while the French market was expected to continue to suffer due to economic problems. ($1=.5950 Pound)\n", "The board of directors of WMX Technologies Inc. Wednesday rallied around its Chief Executive Phillip Rooney following a direct attack on his leadership by a major stockholder.\nAn investment group led by financier George Soros called Tuesday for Rooney's ouster and proposed a slate of nominees for the board of the largest U.S. garbage-hauling company.\nIn response, the WMX board said it \"unanimously reaffirmed its support for Phillip B. Rooney and his leadership of the company during his seven months as chief executive officer.\"\nThe exchange did little but aggravate the acrimonious struggle involving WMX, Soros and other large shareholders.\n\"I don't think they could really escalate the animosity any higher than it already is,\" said James Kelleher, industry analyst at the Argus Research firm in New York.\nThe New York-based Soros group and other investors, including the Lens Fund in Washington, D.C., have been pressuring WMX to improve its performance for months.\nWMX, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said last week that it was cutting 3,000 jobs and shedding $1.5 billion in assets in a broad effort to refocus on its core waste management business.\nOn Tuesday, the Soros group expressed dissatisfaction with the restructuring plan, proposed removing Rooney and named four individuals to its alternate slate of board nominees.\nEven with a 5.2-percent stake in WMX, the Soros group cannot dictate the company's future, especially in the face of widespread small shareholder scepticism about the large shareholders' motives.\n\"They can make a lot of noise and smoke, but when everything is done, their effectiveness is limited ... This thing is far from over,\" Kelleher said.\nWMX last week reported a fourth-quarter loss of $461 million after charges, vs. a profit in the year-ago period of $49.6 million. It  reported revenues for all of 1996 of $9.18 billion, compared with $9.05 billion in 1995.\nWMX said Wednesday that the board nominees do not qualify for consideration at the company's annual meeting this year.\n\"The documents we received from the Soros group attempting to nominate four individuals for election as directors of the company arrived after the filing deadline and contained incomplete information,\" WMX said in a statement.\nWMX added that its board was committed to search for the best possible candidates and its nominating committee had agreed to consider the Soros nominees later this year.\n\"Our board is absolutely committed to attracting the best directors possible. We want to make sure we are serving the interests of all of our stockholders,\" WMX said.\nIf Soros does not prevail before or during the WMX annual meeting scheduled for early May, time may be on his side.\n\"WMX is far from out of the woods and is likely going to have a few more painful quarters, which will strengthen Soros' hand so that he might succeed next time,\" Kelleher said.\nThe WMX board said that Rooney, a long-time manager of the company's waste management business, was the right leader for the company as it concentrates on that industry.\nWMX also said an important component of its restructuring plan was adding new, independent perspectives to its board and reiterated it had hired an executive recruiting firm to find appropriate candidates.\nWMX's stock, which fell 9 percent last week, was up 50 cents at $32.75 in heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that improving the regulation of beleaguered Czech capital markets was on his agenda, but he took a shot at critics who have said the improvement was coming too slowly.\nSpeaking at a banking and finance forum in Prague, Klaus said that \"we are searching for new forms of regulations.\"\n\"But I disagree with those critics, mostly foreigners, who look at the existing quality of our capital markets and are surprised that they do not equal Wall Street, the City of London or any other well-established western financial centre yet,\" Klaus told the conference.\n\"Their high-brow attitude and their absolutist, almost doctrinal phraseology is something what does not help much.\"\nHowever Klaus, a professor of economics and fierce anti-regulation campaigner, added that finding the right extent of capital market regulation was an \"imminent task\".\nMany foreign equity analysts and investors frequently criticise the Czech markets for a lack of quality company information and clear pricing of shares, insider trading, and poor oversight of numerous investment funds.\nMany analysts use Poland and its more stringent capital market regulation as an example of why the Warsaw Stock Exchange attracts much more foreign investment than Prague.\nSeparately, Klaus said that the country had too many banks and investment funds, and many were poorly managed.\nA crisis in small private banks peaked last year when Agrobanka, the fifth largest and the largest fully-private bank, was put under forced administration by the central bank, the last and largest in a dozen recent interventions.\nKlaus said a liberal approach to granting banking and capital markets licences in the early 1990's came from the need for more private financial houses and competition, and nobody knew what the right number of institutions would be.\n\"We have too many banks and too many investment funds now, and we also know that not all of them function perfectly or are in the best possible hands,\" Klaus said.\nThe Finance Ministry's capital markets oversight office has recently stepped up its activity with a wave of actions against illegal asset-stripping by managers of mostly smaller Czech investment funds.\nBut the ministry is still under fierce criticism from investors and the media for a lack of activity.\nKlaus has revealed a plan to gradually separate the capital market supervision from the Finance Ministry, a process which has started in February by creating a separate Securities Bureau within the ministry.\nUnder the plan, the Czech Securities Registry started publishing over-the counter trades registred at the centre earlier this year.\nKlaus also admitted that a period at the start of the privatisation process in the early 1990's when state firms were not yet privatised led to a loss of many assets as state supervision relaxed but new owners were still not in place.\n\"This is something what the future privatising countries should avoid,\" Klaus told the conference.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003\n", "Czech annual average consumer inflation eased slightly in 1996, not as much as original government forecasts but still pleasing analysts.\nThe Czech Statistical Bureau said on Thursday that its key sliding average inflation figure, which uses 1993 as a base, closed the year at 8.8 percent, down from 9.1 percent for 1995.\nDespite missing the government's original eight percent forecast, analysts said they were optimistic the central bank's tight monetary policies were hitting the mark, bringing inflation back under control after a strong first half surge.\n\"The final outcome on average inflation is a success because of its favourable development in the second half of the year,\" Martin Kupka, an economist at investment bank Patria Finance told Reuters.\n\"Of course in the longer run, we still need to see a more rapid decrease in inflation,\" he added.\nThe CSU said month-on-month inflation for December was 0.5 percent, unchanged from November, putting consumer prices 8.6 percent higher, year-on-year, steady with the previous month.\nCSU chairman Edvard Outrata told Reuters that 1996 core inflation remained around five percent with government price dergeulations comprising the rest.\nBut he said 1997 inflation would rest on whether or not the government decides to take further, stronger steps on freeing up energy and housing prices.\nThe CSU said that price increases in foodstuffs, leisure and textile sectors accounted for some 80 percent of the monthly CPI rise.\nThe CSU said industrial output slowed in November to an increase of only 1.4 percent, year-on-year, from a 5.3 percent rise in output in October while industrial wages were 17.1 percent higher for the first 11 months of the year.\nAfter the release of the figures, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said wage growth without productivity increases stemmed from a lack of industrial restructuring.\n\"We thought it (inflation) would be lower, and what I see, aboveall, is a fundamental wage problem,\" he said.\n\"The slower restructuring in some companies...is also a source of inflation, because it is generating of inflationary money, mainly through rising wages, without a respective effect (in output)\" Dlouhy added.\nThe government battled wage growth throughout the economy with wage controls, ended in 1995, which tied rising wages to correspnding increases in industrial output.\nPay rises in 1996, not matched by an increase in productivity, have accelerated an already large trade deficit, by sparking domestic demand which has in turn caused higher inflation and made exported goods less competitive.\nBoris Gomez of ING Barings Capital Markets warned attempts to further force down inflation in 1997 may be thwarted if wage growth cannot be brought under control.\n\"The December CPI figure was positive since even though there a strong Christmas shopping spree by Czechs...But we still are concerned about the effects of wage growth since it will be tough for the government to cap it,\" he said.\nMost analysts agreed that the central bank would continue its tight monetary policies at least for the first quarter of 1997, in order to keep a lid on inflationary pressures.\nThe Czech crown too is expected to remain stable in the short-term despite lingering problems in forcing inflation down. Traders said the crown was unaffected by December's CPI figures since they were in line with forecasts.\nThe crown was fixed by the cental bank on Thursday at 3.72 percent above its dollar/mark basket midpoint, slightly stronger than its +3.57 percent fixing the previous day.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "With the ruling Liberals far ahead in the polls, the biggest question in the campaign for Canada's June 2 federal election is not who will win but which opposition party will place second.\n\"It's an election that's quite unlike what you see in other Western countries because there really is no realistic option (aside from the Liberals),\" Reg Whitaker, a political scientist at York University in Toronto, said recently.\n\"The opposition parties are fighting for small markets. It's wide open for the Liberals.\"\nDespite opposition criticism of the Liberals' record on national unity, unemployment and taxes, polls show the Liberal party with a consistently strong lead.\nThe official opposition since the last election in 1993 has been the Bloc Quebecois, whose sole aim is promoting Quebec independence, not forming a federal government. \"They want to put themselves out of business,\" Whitaker said. \"So right off you have a bizarre situation.\"\nPrime Minister Jean Chretien called the June 2 election on Sunday. In the last election in 1993, the Liberals won 177 out of 295 seats, the Bloc Quebecois 54 seats, the Reform Party 52, the New Democrats nine and the Conservatives two. One independent was elected.\nUnless one of two right-wing parties -- the Conservatives and Reform -- can consolidate nationwide support, analysts said, the Bloc was poised to be the official opposition again, keeping the Quebec sovereignty issue on the front burner.\nReform, with strong roots in western Canada but feeble support elsewhere, has painted itself as the only party that can hold the Liberals accountable. But it stops short of seeking the role of government for now.\n\"Our ultimate objective is to get a Reform government,\" party leader Preston Manning said recently. But when asked about his immediate goal, he said he wanted to win enough seats to form the official opposition.\n\"They're mainly concerned about holding on to what they've got,\" Whitaker said. Reform had 50 seats when the House of Commons was dissolved on Sunday.\nThe Conservatives, led by Quebecker Jean Charest, stubbornly maintain they can form the next government, but the right-leaning party has a long way to go. In 1993 the party, one of the oldest in Canada and the ruling party from 1984 to 1993, lost all but two of its seats in the House of Commons.\n\"They have some severe limitations,\" Whitaker said. \"You see the Conservative Party and the Reform Party fighting over the same right-wing margins.\"\nReform and the Conservatives are both campaigning on smaller government and tax cuts as ways to fix Canada's persistent unemployment problem. The Conservatives, however, stand to gain in Quebec, while Reform has no base in the French-speaking province.\nA poll in Quebec released on Monday showed support for the Liberals at 37 percent, the Bloc at 35 percent and the Conservatives at 25 percent.\nAlone on Canada's left wing is the New Democratic Party, which makes no claims to forming a government.\n\"Federally, we've never made a government, but we've always been there to make a difference,\" NDP leader Alexa McDonough said as she launched her campaign last weekend.\nBut the Liberals have co-opted the NDP too, appealing to moderate left-wing Canadians with talk of preserving health care, social programmes and the national pension system, and promoting Liberal legislation on gun control.\n", "Britain's Courtaulds Textiles Plc on Tuesday reported a first-half loss after one-off charges and said that most of the 30 to 35 million pounds it plans to spend on restructuring will fall in the second half of 1996.\nCourtaulds made a pre-tax loss after exceptional charges of 8.5 million pounds ($13.26 million) compared with profit of 6.4 million in the first half last year. Excluding exceptional charges, pre-tax profit fell to 600,000 pounds from 10.3 million.\nIn a telephone interview with Reuters, the group's new chief executive, Colin Dyer, said his aim is to move ahead quickly on reorganisation, which includes further disposals and creation of four product-led divisions, and get back to a \"clean set of results.\"\nThe decline in profits was mainly in its fabrics division and resulted from weak demand in the U.S. and in continental European for lace, as well as reorganisation costs in Britain.\nDyer said the company is to shed jobs in Britain and western Europe and increase production in low wage economies, especially in Asia. \"The most important thing is that we are attacking our problems and putting them right quickly,\" Dyer said.\nReorganisation into four clear divisions will allow Courtaulds Textiles to focus on its strengths and relieve managers of the burden of \"firefighting,\" Dyer said.\nCourtaulds has sold around half its hit list of a dozen problem businesses, with three disposals announced last week.\nDyer said in total the disposals will account for 160 million pounds of turnover, and those so far announced \"must be getting towrds half.\" Talks on \"one or two\" remaining sales are \"quite advanced,\" he added.\nCourtaulds took a 9.1 million stg restructuring charge in the six months to June, and expects to generate cost-savings of 10 to 13 million pounds a year by 1998. Dyer said benefits \"will be kicking in a bit this year, but significantly in 1998.\"\nHe declined to give exact forecasts for 1996 as a whole, but added that analysts' profit forecasts \"are not far away on the full year.\" Analysts are predicting full-year pre-tax profit of between 34.0 and 40.6 million stg before exceptional items.\nHe also would not be drawn on whether the company will be able to continue to maintain its dividend. \"We will take that half by half,\" he said. It held its interim dividend at 5.2p.\nDyer also signaled the group's intention of \"moving the cost base from Britain and western Europe to lower cost manufacturing\" and warned that opposition Labour Party plans to introduce a minimum wage in Britain would make matters worse.\n\"There will be job losses,\" Dyer said, but would not give further details. Courtaulds currently has operations in Britain, France, Germany and Spain, as well as Morocco and Turkey.\nDyer said the Far East offers clear advantages in terms of labour costs and access to raw materials. The group already operates in the Philippines and Thailand, where it makes stretch fabrics.\nTurning to individual markets, Dyer said the U.S. is \"a mixed bag,\" with fabrics \"very strong\" but lace \"bumping along the bottom\". \"Britain is quite strong. All you read in the press about the feelgood factor is right,\" he said.\n\"The European scene is mixed. Germany and Italy are still poor but lace is showing signs of recovery in the second half,\" Dyer said, adding that \"France is the deadest\" market, with consumer spending flat.

It was reduced by a change in accounting for directory revenues, the assessment of prior-period service rebates and Nynex's decision not to stimulate certain markets while it was in the process of improving services.\nBell Atlantic Corp. said its profits, depressed by one-time items, fell to $346 million, or 79 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $392 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion.\nExcluding one-time gains and losses, however, Bell Atlantic's operating income grew 7.3 percent to $424 million from $395 million.\n\"We posted strong gains in our key communications markets in 1996 as we prepare to complete our merger with NYNEX in 1997,\" said Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond W. Smith.\nThe two companies agreed to merge in April 1996, hoping to create a company with over $50 billion in market capitalisation. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of March.\n\"Robust market demand for our communications products and services has produced record revenue growth and record earnings that will strengthen our competitiveness in existing markets and support our entry into significant new markets such as in-region long distance,\" Smith said.\nFor the year, Bell Atlantic earned $1.88 billion, or $4.28 a share, on revenue of $13.1 billion. In 1995, the company earned $1.86 billion, or $4.24 a share, on sales of $13.4 billion.\n\"Both Bell Atlantic and Nynex reported better than expected results compared to analysts' consensus,\" said Bill Vogel, analyst at brokers Dillon Reed.\n\"Bell Atlantic had a very strong and robust quarter. There were quite a few charges in the quarter, fundamental volumes of the business are at or above expectations,\" he said. \"For NYNEX it was the first back-to-back years with double-digit earnings growth.\"\nSBC Communications Inc., parent of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., said its net income rose 4.8 percent to $542.9 million, or 90 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $517.8 million, or 85 cents a share, in the year-ago period.\n\"Our outstanding financial performance was driven by excellent results by our wireline and wireless businesses, as strong demand and effective marketing led to the addition of a total of 1.5 million customer lines during the year,\" said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman and chief executive.\nPacific Telesis Group, with which SBC is merging, is expected to report earnings later Tuesday.\nSouthwestern Bell had an outstanding year, with revenues up a record 8.9 percent, compared with 5.8 percent in 1995. The growth was driven by a 9.7 percent increase in local service revenue, up from 7 percent a year ago.\nSouthwestern Bell added 732,000 access lines during 1996 and 156,000 during the fourth quarter, compared with 611,000 during 1995 and 149,000 in the fourth quarter a year ago, for a total of 15.0 million access lines at the end of the year.\nCaller ID, one of SBC's flagship products, expanded its market penetration to nearly 37 percent.\n", "North American garbage companies can be expected to continue picking over each others' assets as big firms sell off money-losers and small players consolidate, the top executives of the biggest haulers and handlers of waste said on Monday.\nAt a conference held by the Raymond James brokerage and investment bank, a half dozen trash hauling companies made presentations to investors. In all the talks, asset strategy figured prominently.  \nIn the top tier of the industry, the two biggest U.S. firms -- WMX Technologies Inc and Browning Ferris Industries Inc -- control about a quarter of the $35 billion solid waste market.\nBoth WMX and BFI are fast shedding non-core and unprofitable operations as they reposition and rationalize after years of undisciplined acquisitions, analysts said. At the same time, Canadian giant Laidlaw Inc is transforming itself into a transportation company and leaving the solid waste market, as well as the $3.5 billion hazardous waste market, in which it had dominated in North America.  \nAt the lower levels, fast-growing mid-sized companies -- such as USA Waste Services Inc, United Waste Systems Inc and Superior Services Inc -- are playing the consolidation game. By sifting through the giants' dross and snapping up deals from among dozens of small, private firms, the mid-cap players are growing rapidly.\n\"At the end of the day, you'll have an industry that has sorted through its asset base so that several companies will be better positioned,\" said Todd Holmes, vice president at Browing Ferris, based in Houston.  \nTrash hauling and handling turned into a hot business in North America in the 1970s with the rise of environmentalism and stricter government regulation of polluters. Riding a wave of rapid consolidation in a highly fragmented industry, innovators like WMX and BFI experienced explosive growth. In its first 20 years, industry leader WMX made 2,000 acquisitions.\nBut the boom years ended in the 1990s with a levelling of environmental regulation, greater market concentration among companies and a surplus of supply in several key markets.  \nIn addition, added Laidlaw chief executive James Bullock, \"The focus of solid waste handling is migrating away from landfill to recycling, which has lower (profit) margins and suffers from the vagaries of commodity prices.\"\nFor WMX and BFI, too, growth by acquisition hit an inevitable ceiling as the pool of affordable targets dried up.\n\"The consolidation strategy was unsustainable for us,\" said WMX chief financial officer John Sanford.\nOak Brook, Ill.-based WMX reacted to these changes by diversifying in the 1990s into related businesses, but the strategy failed, leading to shareholder disappointment.  \nLaidlaw, based in Burlington, Ont., has separated itself from its solid and hazardous waste operations. It still owns sizable stakes in the successor companies -- Laidlaw Environmental Services and Allied Waste Industries Inc -- but expects to sell its interests, valued at a combined $1.2 billion.\n\"Over time, you will see us exit our investments in both of those,\" Bullock said in an interview with Reuters.\nAt the next level down, growth by acquisition continues. The business has virtually no barriers to entry -- any outfit with a half-dozen garbage trucks can get a route and make itself a takeover target.\nAs a result, Bullock said, \"The little guys are still playing the consolidation game...They can be successful at that for a while.\"\n", "Members of Britain's third largest building society, the Woolwich, on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly in favour of ditching the mortgage lender's 150-year-old mutual status in favour of becoming a publicly listed bank.\nAfter a special general meeting the proposals, which will give individual members a share windfall worth an average 1,200 pounds ($1,961), were approved by more than 95 percent of both the savers and borrowers who voted.\n\"...We probably weren't too surprised but it's pleasant that our members feel exactly the same way because quite frankly we've put a lot of thought into trying to get this right,\" said John Stewart, Woolwich chief executive.\nLast month the Woolwich said the handout of at least 450 shares to qualifying members would go to around 2.57 million people, including qualifying members and pensioners.\nAround 1,200 members, many unhappy with the conversion, turned up at the meeting but the vote was decided by a large postal vote.\nStewart told Reuters that Woolwich Plc, as it will be known when the 3.0 billion pound flotation goes ahead in July, wanted to offer \"a full range of personal financial services\" and planned to expand into areas such as pensions.\n\"That's an area we will either grow into organically or we might make an acquisition...\" he said, adding that the group was \"a bit light in weight\" in other areas such as life assurance and unit trusts.\nHe did not rule out the possibility of acquisitions to expand the Woolwich's business, but he stressed that if they happened these were likely to be friendly mergers, not hostile takeovers. \"The Woolwich's history is as a white knight, most people come to us because someone else is threatening them.\"\nStewart said the Woolwich, founded in 1847 in south London and set to become a FTSE-100 company and one of Britain's 10 largest banks, would also press ahead with building up relatively high-margin business in France and Italy.\nHe said the Woolwich would not be looking at other European countries unless \"it was the right opportunity\" because it was already established and doing very well in France and Italy.\nBut there are plans to develop so-called \"telebanking\" and electronic banking, the latter probably starting this year and telephone banking in 1998.\nThe Woolwich is one of four building societies planning stock market flotations during 1997. The others are Britain's biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax, the Alliance &amp; Leicester and Northern Rock.\nSome members protested at the Woolwich's plans to shed its mutual status -- where the building society is owned by its savers and borrowers -- in favour of being a publicly listed company with shareholders who expect dividends.\nA number argued that this would reduce the favourable savings rates which building societies have traditionally paid compared with their bank counterparts and increase make loans to house-buyers more expensive.\nBut Stewart said this would not be the case as Britain's increasingly competitive financial services market and the economies of scale from conversion meant the Woolwich would have to offer not only top quality service but also competitive lending and savings rates.\nStewart told the meeting that Woolwich members should not \"get too hung up about being a bank\", adding it had no intention of moving into commercial lending, international lending or investment banking but would continue to focus on housing finance and retail savings.\n", "A ministerial conference of Mekong River nations on Friday agreed to push forward cross-border cooperation to build a prosperous future for the once war-torn region.\nGrowing trust among the six nations of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) would allow huge investment in what was being dubbed the \"last frontier of economic development\", said Bong-Suh Lee, Asian Development Bank (ADB) vice president.\n\"We can expect such investment to grow rapidly and reach a target of at least $1.3 billion by the turn of the century,\" Lee told a news conference after the meeting in China's southwestern Kunming city.\nMinisters of Burma, Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam agreed at the conference to pursue development of infrastructure projects aimed at knitting together a region long divided by bitter distrust and war.\nThe ministers approved work to map out strategies for the next 25 years of development along the mighty Mekong River.\nThe ADB, which backs the GMS programmes, had prepared $300 million in loans ready for investment in the region over the next three years, Lee told the conference.\nFar greater sums would be needed to finance crucial projects such as a road connecting Bangkok to Phnom Penh and Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, said Gunther Hecker of the ADB's transport and communication department.\n\"The $300 million is the trigger element for others to follow,\" Hecker told Reuters. \"We lay the seeds.\"\nLee said at least $9 billion would be needed to finance transport and telecommunications projects in the region, home to around 230 million people, and added that the private sector was appearing more willing to contribute.\n\"I have heard from many private investors that probably the GMS is the last frontier of economic development,\" he said.\nInvestor enthusiasm is relatively new to much of the Mekong River region, which was riven for decades by conflicts over ideology and borderlines.\nChina and Vietnam clashed repeatedly in the 1980s after a bloody border conflict in 1979.\nVietnamese troops fought Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia through the late 1980s while fighting was far from rare among many of the region's other borders.\nGMS meetings had been vital in building trust in the region, conference participants said.\nPriority GMS projects include a Kunming-to-Bangkok highway, a fibre-optic cable telecommunications loop through Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia and action to curb deforestation on the Mekong's upper reaches.\nMinisters at the conference said the ADB should continue its role as organiser of regional projects but agreed on the need for closer coordination with other potential investors from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other nations.\nHow coordination would be organised was not decided in detail, but observer Finn Nielsen of the World Bank said huge funding requirement in the region meant there was little chance of a turf war breaking out among development investors.\n\"There are more projects here than the ADB, the World Bank or anyone can handle, so that isn't a problem,\" Nielsen said.\n", "In a show that Deng Xiaoping may not have wanted, China's state television gave his 1.2 billion people a lingering last look at the body of their deceased patriarch on Monday as official mourning moved into high gear.\nDraped with the crimson hammer-and-sickle flag of Chinese communism and showered with flower petals, the body was shown lying in state at Beijing's 301 Military Hospital as grim-faced leaders and weeping relatives filed past.\nDeng, who died on Wednesday aged 92, had expressly forbidden the elaborate public grieving that has attended the deaths of top Chinese leaders in the past.\nBut China Central Television's main evening newscast, the most widely watched broadcast in the country, effectively overruled him by devoting its main evening news to emotional scenes of farewells to his body before its cremation on Monday.\nPale and puffy, the body was repeatedly shown lying on a bier surrounded by grieving members of China's elite and elaborate funeral wreaths of plastic flowers.\nSoviet-trained technocrat President Jiang Zemin, Deng's hand-picked successor, led an official group of mourners that included all members of the ruling Communist Party politburo and other senior government and party leaders.\nJiang, looking ill at ease, shook hands with Deng's weeping family but said nothing. He led the mourners in the three traditional bows of respect to the body and is expected to read the eulogy at official memorial rites in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday.\nAfter a slow and stately funeral cortege to the Babaoshan cemetery where revolutionary veterans are traditionally cremated, Deng's body lying in a glass-topped bier was carried into a final anteroom by an honour guard of eight soldiers..\nSonorous music played in the background as Deng's grey-haired wife, Zhuo Lin, and other family members were shown sobbing and wailing.\nOne of his three daughters, Deng Nan, bent down to embrace and kiss her father's forehead, clinging to his body. Another daughter, Deng Rong, cried out \"You are not dead!\"\nThe television pictures seemed clearly aimed at stirring an emotional response among the 1.2 billion people Deng ruled for 18 years, but who have shown little open grief at his death last week at the age of 92.\nPeople lining the funeral courtege's route from the hospital to the cemetery -- most of whom were marshalled to attend by their work units -- were shown crying quietly and tenderly affixing white paper flowers of mourning to their jackets.\nIn sobbing interviews, one after another pledged to honour Deng's memory and to forge ahead with his ideals.\n\"Scatter Hot Tears for Comrade Xiaoping\" read one banner held by mourners along the route.\n", "Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec on Monday said his country viewed as frivolous and \"absolutely unacceptable\" Russian hints of economic reprisals for Prague's entry into NATO.\n\"We consider it frivolous to connect the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance with bilateral (Czech-Russian) relations and threaten economic sanctions in this context,\" the Czech news agency CTK quoted Zieleniec as saying.\nMoscow's ambassador to Prague, Nikolai Ryabov, warned the Czech Republic on Sunday that key bilateral agreements with Russia might be jeopardised if it joined NATO.\nRyabov told Russia's NTV commercial television that the former Warsaw Pact member's entry into the Western defence alliance could mean a damaging loss of arms markets for Moscow.\nThe ambassador went on to hint that Moscow could reconsider economic deals with Prague if it went ahead.\n\"Agreements fundamental to the Czech Republic, such as gas deliveries and nuclear energy, create a basis for future problems that our countries would face,\" he said.\nZieleniec told CTK that Ryabov's statement made it clear why the Czechs wanted to join Western organisations.\n\"This type of demand is one of the reasons why it is important...at the earliest, to become a member of the key Western political, economic, and security organisations,\" Zieleniec said.\nHe said he thought the ambassador's interview on Russian television was mostly for media consumption.\nThe Czechs, Poland and Hungary are expected to be named among the first former-Soviet Bloc countries to be invited to join NATO at a July summit of the alliance in Madrid.\nAfter the collapse of former communist trade arrangements in the early part of the decade, total Czech trade turnover with Russia grew 9.8 percent in 1996 to $2.8 billion.\nBut it was heavily weighted in Russia's favour with Czech exports to Russia at $694 million while imports from Russia were $2.1 billion.\nCzechs are still dependent on Russia for natural gas and most of their crude oil, but Prague is in the final stages of negotiations of a long-term contract for some of its gas supplies to come from Norway.\nLast year, the Czechs opened the Ingolstadt spur in the Transalpine crude pipeline from the Adriatic Sea, providing direct access to crude from the Middle East.\nThe Czech power company CEZ a.s. is also dependent on Russian nuclear fuel for its lone atomic power station at Dukovany. But the company is expected to take U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel when it opens a new plant at Temelin by the end of the century.\nThe Czech army is also considering several offers to modernise its mostly Soviet-era equipment with Western-made, NATO-compatible goods.\n", "Japanese workers are facing another year of marginal salary increases as traditional systems of fixed pay rises give way to greater wage flexibility and growing job insecurity.\nWith Japanese companies struggling to maintain competitiveness and profit margins in a tough global marketplace, employers are showing waning enthusiasm for the \"shunto\" spring wage talks in which pay hikes used to be standardised across industrial sectors.\nEconomists estimate that the average wage rise for Japanese salaried workers at big companies will be around 2.9 percent for the coming business year, which starts in April, against an actual 2.86 percent, or 8,712 yen ($72) per month increase for 1996/97 -- less than the rise targeted by labour unions.\nThe central group representing Japan's labour unions is seeking an average wage increase of 4.4 percent, or 13,000 yen ($108), this spring, similar to last year's target.\nUnder a system introduced 40 years ago, labour representatives and management hold their shunto \"spring offensive\" in February and March to seek unified wage increases through collective negotiations.\nA fixed pay scale was one of the cornerstones of the lifetime employment system under which armies of salaried workers toiled long hours to fuel Japanese economic growth, assured of a rising paycheck in return for years of service.\nBut with more companies introducing merit-based pay and cutting costs to stay competitive, the power of labour unions to secure broad-based raises has ebbed.\nThis year, labour is calling for increased wages in light of the scheduled rise in the nation's consumption tax from three to five percent in April but the unions' bargaining power is limited, given the weak economy and a traditional reluctance to resort to strike action.\nEconomists say that while corporate earnings are projected to improve in 1996/97, helped by the weaker yen, management wants this to be reflected in bonus payments -- which are flexible -- rather than annual pay increases.\nThey say managers will not meet labour demands, given Japan's stable consumer prices and rising competition, particularly from other Asian countries with low wage costs.\nAtsushi Ohsaka, a director at Asahi Bank Ltd, said that the \"shunto\" system had benefits for both management and labour when Japan had a job-for-life system -- at least for certain male salaried workers -- as well as seniority-linked pay and a growing economy. \"But the situation is changing,\" he said.\nUnder the traditional system, older workers would be paid more even if their productivity slowed, while some younger workers would get less than their performance merited.\nManagement feels it is difficult to maintain such a system in a mature economy and a rapidly ageing society, economists said. In addition, the gap between the relative financial strengths of individual companies and sectors is widening, making it hard to set standardised pay rises.\nFor instance, the Non-Government Railways Association, an employers' body, decided earlier this month that its members would each hold separate \"shunto\" talks with labour rather than collective ones.\nManagement and labour at Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd, an Osaka-based pharmaceutical company, are negotiating to introduce a system of performance-based pay from April, a company spokeswoman said.\nMasao Yuki, executive vice president at Nikko Securities Co Ltd, recently said that the most important and urgent issue for Nikko was how to cut personnel costs while raising the salaries of talented young workers and maintaining overall morale. He acknowledged this would be a very difficult task and he had no specific ideas at this time.\nAsahi Bank's Osaka said: \"It is inevitable that Japan's employment system as well as shunto will change at a time of economic globalisation and fierce international competition...But the change will be gradual...as humans are not just objects.\"\n", "Retailers are expected to post sales gains in the single digits for March, bolstered by low-end discount stores sales while department store performance was nearly flat compared with a year ago.\n\"It appears there's a slowdown in the department store end of the business, but the discounters are still doing well,\" Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said.\nOverall, he expects comparable-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be up about 5 percent or slightly less.\nAn early Easter could depress sales at stores that were closed on the holiday, which fell in the March selling period instead of April this year. Winter storms in much of the northern part of the nation may have also held sales back.\n\"You need to look at March and April overall to get comparable sales,\" William Armstrong, an analyst at Fahnestock &amp; Co. Inc. said of quirks in the reporting calendar, where some retailers include Easter in March and others in April this year.\nArmstrong is expecting overall retail sales for March to increase by 2 percent to 4 percent.\nMost retailers will report March sales early Thursday. But Plano, Tex.-based J.C. Penney Co. Inc. Tuesday reported a 3.7 percent decline in comparable-store sales at its JCPenney stores in March. The early report was due to a debt offering the company is making this week.\nThe loss of one day's sales because of Easter hurt sales, J.C. Penney said.\nPenney's decline is expected to be mirrored by other department stores, analysts said.\n\"Most (department store) chains saw flat or even slightly lower comparable sales during the March period, as they compared with healthy year-ago increases,\" analysts at Montgomery Securities wrote in a research report. They added that the early Easter and snowstorms in the Northeast added to pressure on sales.\nAt the same time, discount stores are expected to post 4 percent to 6 percent sales gains, with low-end discounters reporting low double-digit gains, Montgomery said.\n\"We continue to believe the low-end strata is benefitting from the fruits of a fully-employed economy and the direct pay-hike from the 1996 minimum wage increase,\" Montgomery's analysts wrote.\nAmong the major chains, analysts see Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, reporting same-store sales gains of about 7 percent. Sears, Roebuck and Co. was expected to report gains of 2 percent to 3 percent, with Kmart Corp. up 10 percent to 12 percent.\nKmart's results are expected to be driven by seasonal items, such as horticulture, home goods and bicycles. But it will give back some of those gains in April because of the calendar shift, analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a research note. Kmart stores were open on Easter, analysts added.\nDayton Hudson Corp. is expected to post a 1 percent to 2 percent gain, with a 3 percent to 4 percent increase at its Target discount stores offsetting flat department store sales. Federated Department Stores Inc. is expected to post flat sales, with some planned promotions moved into April, analysts said.\n", "The Czech National Bank (CNB) said on Wednesday that it was not satisfied with the continued firming of the Czech crown, and cautioned that it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary.\n\"Intervention (on the market) is our normal instrument, and we can use it whenever we are not satisfied (with the crown's exchange rate),\" CNB spokesman Martin Svehla told Reuters.\nThe crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket on Wednesday, as the CNB matched the market, fixing it at 27.947/dollar 16.664/mark, or 5.42 percent over parity with the basket, and just below Tuesday's record fixing at +5.51.\n\"The other question is whether we are satisfied? You heard (CNB) governor (Josef Tosovsky) saying there is 'no reason' for the crown to be like this,\" Svehla added.\n\"It signals that the central bank is not fully satisfied with this development.\" He declined to elaborate, and said these were just \"general\" comments.\nThe crown's surge has been fuelled by more than 30 billion crowns in recent issues of mostly medium-term Eurobonds.\nTosovsky said at the peak of the wave in late January that there was \"no rational\" macroeconomic reason for the crown's rise, and the Eurobond wave.\nThe firming currency is compounding a troublesome trade deficit which grew to a record 160 billion crowns in 1996.\nSome crown dealers have said the central bank that had been putting out feelers in the market recently, but others said that it did not appear that intervention was imminent.\n\"I don't expect any direct intervention soon,\" said Citibank dealer Emil Stava. \"I don't think their main goal is to help exporters by a depreciation of the currency.\"\nHe said the CNB was still mainly concerned with controlling the money supply and inflation.\nThe market has not bought the CNB's comments, as dealers keep buying crowns.\nCrown Eurobonds keep coming -- another billion crowns was issued on Wednesday -- taking advantage of interest rate spreads against major currencies and an inverted yield curve.\nThe CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent.\nSvehla repeated that the CNB had no immediate plans to lower its key interest rates, despite a rapid decline in the money supply in recent months.\nThe CNB's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent, while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June.\nMeanwhile inflation in January slowed to 7.4 percent, year-on-year, from 8.6 percent in December.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "State-owned Gaz de France plans to spend billions of francs upgrading its infrastructure to meet demand growing at an estimated three percent a year.\nChairman Pierre Gadonneix said on Wednesday he was against European rules aimed at liberalising the gas industry because that would focus minds on the short term whereas long term commitments were needed.\n\"It's extremely difficult to make people understand that while we have for a few more years an abundance of gas, we need long term deals to ensure our medium term needs,\" Gadonneix told reporters at a visit to the \"Artere du Midi\" gas pipeline under construction.\nHe said European liberalisation could not do for gas what it had done for electricity, noting there were big differences between the two energy sectors.\nWhile all European countries produce electricity, only Britain and the Netherlands export gas in the European Union and the other member states are almost completely dependent on imports from Norway, Russia and north Africa.\n\"I am not against a spot market,\" Gadonneix said, \"As long as it does not hurt the long term (20-25 years) commitments.\"\nIt takes many years to build a gas infrastructure and in France's case it is far from completed. Gaz de France will have spent 4.5 billion francs on transport and distribution in 1996 and will spend five billion in 1997 with a 10 percent growth rate for many more years to come.\nTo amortise these investments takes many years. On top of that there is the question of the national security of assuring supply, now arranged by so-called \"take or pay\" contracts.\n\"The producer takes a risk on the price, we take a risk on the volume,\" Gadonneix said.\nHe is not in favour of allowing big clients to order natural gas directly from the producer, but he does support the existing European gas transit system. \"The Europe of gas distribution has been working for 30 years, long before people wanted to invent rules for it,\" he said.\nGas firms have agreed deals for the transit of gas, based on a \"normal\" reward for the investment on one side while on the other the advantages of scale are being passed on to the user.\nFrance, due to its geographic position, transits gas from Norway to Spain -- some two billion cubic metres this year, rising to 2.6 billion in 1997.\nGadonneix does not believe that Gaz de France should remain for ever in the hands of the state.\n\"It does not make a difference. For me there are well-run companies and badly-run companies. We have to serve our clients, take account of our staff and our shareholder whether it is the state or the private sector,\" he said.\nThe \"Artere du Midi\" pipeline, a one billion franc investment for Gaz de France, links Marseille to Toulouse for the transport of gas from Algeria to the southwest of France. The link will also help to transport gas to Spain.\nGadonneix said that in France gas has a 13 percent share in the market for energy products, against fuel and electricity, while the average for Europe is 20 percent.\n\"Almost every day of the year we connect a new village,\" he said. This, with the new cogeneration of electricity from gas as well as oil or coal, means that demand will grow by three percent per year, or one billion cubic metres.\nFor this, the company has two other infrastructure projects, one to land gas from Norway and another for Dutch gas.\nGadonneix is also enthusiastic about new uses of gas and the company will in 1997 start an experiment with an undisclosed town for buses and municipality vehicles to run on natural gas to help cut pollution.\n", "The consortium building the 2000 Olympic Stadium in Sydney has sought permission from the International Olympic Committee to sell Games tickets overseas after struggling to find local buyers for its financing scheme.\nThe Stadium Australia group -- hoping to ride the coat-tails of Atlanta Games enthusiasm -- said in October it wanted to raise A$364.4 million (US$282.4 million) by selling packages of Olympic tickets, equity and stadium memberships.\nBut a lack of local buyers for the 34,400 packages, which sell for A$10,000 each, has twice forced underwriters to extend their deadline for the novel Olympic float.\nAs a result of the slow demand, Stadium Australia want to sell the ticket component of the package separately to overseas buyers after originally restricting the scheme to the domestic market.\n\"We are in negotiation with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). We are also talking to the Olympic committees in the U.S., U.K. and several other countries,\" a Stadium Australia spokeswoman told Reuters.\nThe underwriters must fund the project regardless of whether all the packages are sold, thus guaranteeing the completion of the 110,000-seat stadium, which is due to open in 1999 at a cost of A$660 million.\nEach \"Gold\" package includes one seat at each of the stadium sessions during the Olympics, a seat at most sporting events at the stadium until 2029 and 1,000 shares in the Stadium company.\nBut city brokers said on Friday only about one third of the packages had been sold as Olympic enthusiasm in the wake of Australia's record medal haul at Atlanta had waned and the local economy had slowed.\n\"There's just not much demand for them and the talk around is only about 30 to 40 percent are spoken for,\" one Sydney broker said.\nOther brokers said repeated attempts to interest private clients had met with little success.\nIf the brokers are correct and the consortium fails to raise any further finance, the stadium's underwriters could be exposed to a shortfall of about A$240 million when the share and ticket offer closes on March 27.\nThe Stadium Australia spokeswoman said the offer was not in trouble and there was enough time to raise the capital, adding that \"considerably more than one third\" of the packages had already been sold.\n\"The demand has not been as great as originally anticipated locally but we have experienced the reverse internationally,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It is a question not of whether we are going to sell them but who we are going to sell them to.\"\nThe four underwriters are ANZ Securities, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Macquarie Bank Ltd, and ABN Amro Hoare Govett.\n(A$1 = US$0.7750)\n", "The French government set out on Wednesday the procedure for privatising defence electronics company Thomson-CSF, including minimum financial terms and conditions.\nThe terms and conditions mark the government's second attempt to sell Thomson-CSF through a private sale after a first effort failed last year when the state tried to sell it as part of the Thomson SA electronics group.\nThe successful bidder or group would become the majority owner by acquiring more than 50 percent of Thomson-CSF's capital and voting rights, the finance ministry said in a statement.\nThe government said on Tuesday it hoped to pick the winning bidder by June 30.\nFirms bidding must have at least five billion francs ($868 million) in equity capital and the same amount in 1995 turnover in non-consumer and defence electronics, it said on Wednesday.\nThe government repeated it would hold a \"golden share\" which gives it an effective veto over changes in ownership to protect the state's strategic defence interests.\nThe statement said that in the case of a group bid, the lead company must plan to hold more than a third of Thomson-CSF's capital and voting rights.\nBidders must declare themselves by 1100 GMT on March 28. The finance ministry would tell the candidates whether they were eligible within five working days, the ministry said.\nOffers must be delivered by 1100 GMT on May 7 and bidders must make an irrevocable offer to buy Thomson-CSF within four months of that date. In a group bid, the partners must set out planned individual holdings and the contractual relations that exist between the companies, the statement said.\nMissiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere indicated in a statement that it was likely to make a bid. But it said it would need information on French state-owned defence and aviation group Aerospatiale.\nThomson-CSF has a number of joint projects with Aerospatiale, which the government ruled out as a sole or joint bidder on Tuesday due to its state ownership.\nEngineering group Alcatel Alsthom had allied itself with Aerospatiale and combat plane maker Dassault Aviation to bid for Thomson-CSF.\n\"Like all the candidates, we are ready to take into account the business electronics and defence activities of Aerospatiale in our industrial plan, with the sole concern, for us, of strengthening Thomson-CSF,\" Lagardere said.\nThis was consistent with Lagardere's approach to the Thomson-CSF sale and the spirit of dialogue that it wanted to develop between itself and Aerospatiale, it said.\nLagardere wanted to know how it would gain access to industrial and financial information on Aerospatiale which would be indispensable for a serious bidder, it added.\nThe Privatisation Commission thwarted the government's first attempt to sell Thomson SA last year to Lagardere, which in turn wanted to sell the loss-making Thomson Multimedia unit to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea for a symbolic one franc.\nThomson-CSF's capital consists of 119.5 million shares, of which 41.7 percent is in public hands. The rest is owned by Thomson SA and Sofivision, with the state holding one share. Thomson SA is state-controlled.\nSome 6.65 million Thomson-CSF shares will be reserved for employees and former staff.\nThe privatisation is part of the state's aim to restructure the defence industry around a few \"national champions\" as a step towards wider European consolidation.\nLagardere said the exclusion of Aerospatiale showed a concern for equitable treatment and reduced Alcatel's industrial plans for Thomson to the \"correct proportions\".\nThomson-CSF makes radars, tactical missiles, radios and integrated complex systems as a defence contractor.\n", "The legal barrage by Netscape Communications Corp. against arch-rival Microsoft Corp. may end up dampening investors' enthusiasm for both stocks, analysts said on Wednesday.\nGary Reback, Netscape's outside counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, has urged the Department of Justice to take immediate action against Microsoft for alleged violations of its 1994 consent decree and antitrust laws.\nSeparately, Tim O'Reilly, head of Internet publisher O'Reilly &amp; Associates, said he was recently approached by a Justice Department official asking about Microsoft's behaviour, perhaps indicating fresh interest in the matter.\nMicrosoft, which has weathered legal battles successfully in the past, has rebuffed the allegations, saying Netscape's claims are \"full of wild and unsubstantiated statements.\"\nThe software giant went on the offensive Wednesday, accusing Netscape of failing to live up to its own promises that it would support open Internet standards.\n\"Netscape should take a good look at themselves in the mirror,\" said Brad Chase, vice president or marketing for Microsoft's Internet division, noting Netscape had blocked users of Microsoft's browser from parts of the Netscape site.\nNevertheless, analysts noted the market has a distaste for legal uncertainty, and investors were likely to start factoring in at least some degree of risk that the battle could escalate into a full-fledged government investigation or lawsuit.\n\"The legal risk is starting to get heightened on this,\" said Montgomery Securities analyst David Readerman, who covered Microsoft during Apple Computer Inc.'s failed five-year copyright lawsuit against the software giant.\nMicrosoft also was probed by the Federal Trade Commission and, subsequently, the Justice Department for five years until its July 1994 signing of a consent decree agreeing to alter the way it licenses operating system software.\nThat accord was viewed by some of its software rivals as having been lenient, and Netscape's lawyer asked the Justice Department in a letter released Tuesday to examine whether Microsoft was now using its control over computer operating systems improperly.\nIn both cases, analysts noted that the hint of further legal difficulties could dampen further advances in the companies' stocks as the market seeks to sort out the business impact, if any.\n\"We've been there with the Apple vs Microsoft and we've been there with the (Justice Department) and the experience is that these stocks tend to stall as the market tries to figure out what the risk is all about,\" said Readerman.\nMicrosoft stock closed up 12.5 cents at $123.50, while Netscape was unchanged at $37.25, both on Nasdaq.\nLawyers in Washington, D.C., said they doubt the Justice Department would find Microsoft had acted improperly, based on the charges leveled against the company by Netscape.\nMountain View, Calif.-based Netscape alleged through its letter to the DOJ that Microsoft had offered \"clandestine side payments\" and discounts on its operating system, and other inducements, to promote use of its own Internet browser.\nThe lawyers contacted by Reuters noted that while Microsoft dominates the PC operating system market with around a 90 percent share, Netscape has an estimated 80 percent share of the market for Internet browser software.\n\"In the browser category, Netscape is the elephant and Microsoft is the mouse,\" said Robert Skitol of Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath. \"It's a bit of a stretch to call what Microsoft is described as doing a violation of the consent decree or a violation of antitrust laws.\"\n", "Australian paper and packaging giant Amcor Ltd, continuing a run of depressing profit results and forecasts, said on Tuesday that it hoped the worst would be over in 1996/97 (July/June).  \nAmcor managing director Don Macfarlane said full-year net profit would be lower than the A$338.8 million achieved in 1995/96 but he saw paper prices rising from early calendar 1998.\n\"If you read the things we have said since the half-year (profit announcement) you would have to come to that conclusion,\" Macfarlane told Reuters.\n\"Hopefully this is the worst of it,\" he added.\nHis comments followed a statement in which Amcor said second half results would be lower than a year-ago and than the 1996/97 first half. There would also be some significant write-downs.\n", "Most Chinese have been slow to forgive and forget Japanese atrocities in World War Two and fear a possible resurgence of militarism in the land of the rising sun, a survey published in Beijing on Saturday showed.\nThe survey, conducted by the official China Youth Daily last December, showed that 99.4 percent of 15,000 people interviewed nationwide thought young Chinese \"should remember\" Japan's 1931-45 occupation of China.\nMore than 97 percent of the respondents were aged below 40, too young to have been victims of Japan's war atrocities. By Beijing's count, 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded by invading Japanese troops.\nAsked what first came to their minds when Japan was mentioned, 81.3 percent of respondents said the Rape of Nanjing.\nJapanese troops marched into Nanjing, China's pre-communist capital and known then as Nanking, in 1937 and engaged in an orgy of rape and massacre. Up to 250,000 Chinese were believed to have been killed.\nMore than 97 percent of respondents said they could not tolerate repeated attempts by Japanese officials to whitewash their wartime atrocities, including the Rape of Nanjing.\nThe China Youth Daily survey showed that 94.9 percent of the respondents were opposed to Japan becoming a United Nations Security Council member.\nIt also showed that 85.1 percent of respondents believed Japan wanted to become a military superpower and 70.7 percent saw Japan as a new threat to peace in Asia.\nChina itself ruffled feathers in the region last March when it intimidated rival Taiwan by conducting missile tests and war games close to the island in the run-up to Taiwan's historic presidential elections.\nThe sheer size of the People's Liberation Army -- the world's biggest at three million -- has caused uneasiness among China's neighbours.\nChina has been mired in a dispute with Japan over a group of islands in the East China Sea and another dispute with Asian neighbours over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.\nThe survey showed that 53.8 percent of respondents thought that Japanese despised Chinese, while 50.8 percent said Japanese discriminated against Chinese.\nMany Chinese themselves harbour deep suspicions and are hostile toward foreigners.\nMore than 56 percent of the respondents said the Japanese were \"cruel\", 45.2 percent said \"arrogant\" and 45.3 percent described them as \"war freaks\" by nature.\nBut 52.7 percent of the respondents said they owned Japanese-made electrical appliances.\nMany respondents were suspicious of Japanese motives for investing in China. More than half said Japanese investment aimed to control China, while 45.3 percent said Japan dumped outdated equipment in China.\nOn Friday, the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, accused the United States and Japan of covering up the U.S. military's firing of uranium-tipped bullets near Okinawa during drills in December 1995 and January 1996.\nThe United States apologised this month.\nThe People's Daily said Washington's argument that the bullets were mislabelled was unconvincing and questioned why the incident was kept a secret for more than a year.\n", "IBM shares fell in heavy trading Friday after three Wall Street firms made negative comments about the giant computer maker in the past two days, saying a stronger dollar and a product transition will hurt earnings.\nThe stock of International Business Machines Corp. fell $4.25 to $132.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the fourth most-active issue with more than 5.3 million shares traded.\n\"People are beginning to realise that it's going to be a bleak quarter,\" said Jay Stevens, analyst at Dean Witter. But he continued to recommend accumulating IBM stock.\nAnalysts said two main factors were hurting IBM's earnings prospects. Even though the world's largest computer maker will have a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding due to its share buyback plan, currency fluctuations and expected weakness in mainframe sales will hurt the first half of 1997, they said.\nMorgan Stanley on Friday cut its earnings estimates for IBM, saying that the Armonk, N.Y.-based company will make more money toward the end of the year instead of earlier. It also said results will be affected by currency fluctuations and the transition to a new mainframe model.\n\"Some users may wait for the new one,\" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst.\nMorgan Stanley cut its earnings per share estimate to $2.80 from $2.97 for the second quarter and to $12.30 from $12.50 for all of 1997.\nIBM earned $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share, on revenues of $23.1 billion in the 1996 fourth quarter. For full-year 1996, it reported profits of $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share, on revenues of $75.95 billion.\nMorgan Stanley continued to rate IBM's stock as an outperformer.\nAnalysts said IBM is expected to upgrade its low-cost mainframes to a processor with speeds that match its older bi-polar line that is being phased out.\n\"This is a major product transition,\" Stevens said.\nAnalysts have been expecting initial shipments of the new processors in the third quarter. Milunovich said he expects a few models will be shipped in June.\nMerrill Lynch said on Thursday in a note to clients that it expects demand will be extremely good for the new machines and expects IBM to beat Wall Street's expectations of initial shipments in the third quarter.\nBut until then, the stronger dollar overseas will continue to weigh on earnings, the brokerage said.\nMerrill did not change its current first-quarter estimate of $2.32 a share. But it expects 3 percent revenue growth in the first quarter and a tough comparison vs. a year ago.\nLate Thursday, Dean Witter also lowered its 1997 earnings estimates for IBM, saying its operating income was expected to fall by 11 percent in the first quarter.\nHowever, this is expected to be offset by a lower tax rate of 35 percent vs. a previous 39 percent, along with IBM's current stock repurchase plan, it said.\nDean Witter raised its earnings estimate for the second half of the year and kept its 1997 profit estimate at $14.25 per share.\n", "When it comes to dollars and cents, Hong Kong is showing high confidence in its future -- and that is clearing some doubt on other fronts about the impact of China's takeover, according to political analysts.\n\"The high-performing economy here is underpinning confidence and social order,\" said Michael DeGolyer, political analyst at Hong Kong's Baptist University.\nWith the handover to China 41 days away, Hong Kong's economy is transmitting nothing but positive news.\nThe bellwether property market is booming.\nThe territory's Hang Seng index of blue chip stocks is constantly reaching for record highs, spurred by optimism about improved access to China and recent debt rating upgrades from rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's.\nA current Reuters survey of the territory's top companies confirmed overwhelming business confidence about the future.\nOrdinary Hong Kong people are holding more and more of their financial assets in the local currency, a Credit Lyonnais survey revealed on Tuesday. A growing number of citizens are also sinking money into China-related stocks.\nThe Credit Lyonnais survey also portrayed a growing divide between political and economic confidence, also highlighted by DeGolyer's research.\nWhile two-thirds of Hong Kong people are confident about the territory's political and economic future, only 40 percent were confident about its political future in isolation.\nThis proves the importance of a stable and prosperous economy to Hong Kong's future, DeGolyer said.\n\"The economy continuing to perform well is absolutely vital in making the transition a success. If the economy goes down the tubes, it will take political and social order with it.\"\nA key factor undermining political confidence is future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa's plans to roll back some civil liberties.\nChina argues that the legal changes simply return Hong Kong to the status quo before democratic changes initiated by departing colonial governor Chris Patten.\nPlanned changes requiring police permission for protest rallies and banning foreign funding for political groups are no more severe than those in most Western nations, Tung has said.\nBut Western governments object to changes in the context of China's pledge to allow Hong Kong to continue its own way of life for 50 years.\nGiven the political uncertainties, DeGolyer said it is crucial that Hong Kong's incoming administration ensures that the economy functions well.\nHong Kong had only to look at nearby Macau to see how important it is that the economy not be placed at risk.\nWith China already established as its sovereign, Macau is still administered by the Portuguese, but it has serious problems of crime and social disorder with increasingly frequent shoot-outs and killings.\n\"If the (Hong Kong) economy is messed up, if there are failures in the economy and rises in corruption like we see in Macau, then we will have the same kind of problems Macau is having right now,\" DeGolyer said.\n", "Boeing Co. stock surged Tuesday after the company decided to mothball plans to build a costly stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet.\nBoeing shares jumped $6.875 to a record $113.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, accounting for much of the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is one of 30 stocks in the index of blue-chip companies.\nIndustry analysts estimated the move by the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, announced late on Monday, could reduce Boeing's expenses by more than $2 billion over the next five years and boost annual earnings by as much as $1 a share.\nNatWest Securities analyst Nick Heymann said the decision not to proceed with the risky project removed a cloud of uncertainty over Boeing as it boosts production to meet rising demand and prepares to complete its planned $14 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n\"It's fantastic news,\" he said.\nWhile officials at Boeing rival Airbus Industrie said the European consortium would go ahead with plans for an all-new superjumbo jetliner called the A-3XX, Heymann said he thought that project was dead.\n\"Airbus never really had the resources to go ahead with their aircraft,\" Heymann said.\nHe said it was even less likely the consortium could raise the funds now that Boeing had talked with the same potential customers and determined market conditions did not justify the investment needed for a new big jet.\nBoeing said it would cost more than $7 billion just to develop a new wing and make other changes needed to produce two new versions of the 747 that would add range and capacity.\nAnalysts noted that the estimated cost of developing the so-called 747-500X and 747-600X had ballooned over the past two years from as little as $3 billion as prospective customers such as British Airways Plc and Singapore Airlines Ltd. demanded more features.\nIn the end, only Thai Airways International Ltd. and Malaysian Airline System committed to ordering the proposed new jumbo.\nBoeing executives said the projected demand for fewer than 500 very large jets over the next 20 years was not enough to generate a sufficient shareholder return.\n\"Sufficient market demand has not yet developed to justify committing the significant investment required to develop larger versions of the 747,\" Ron Woodard, president of the Boeing commercial airplane group, said in a statement.\nWhile most of the 1,000 Boeing employees working on the 747-X project will be shifted to other planned derivatives, Woodard said Boeing would continue studying the possibility of a jet bigger than the current-generation 747-400.\nAirbus, which projects a far bigger market for jets that can seat more than 500 passengers, has said it can develop an all-new jet for $8 billion, but analysts peg the total cost at closer to a whopping $15 billion.\nAnalysts said Airbus could develop an attractive airliner to alleviate congestion at the world's biggest airports and on heavily travelled routes, but they were sceptical about the consortium's ability to keep costs down.\n\"At the end of the day it's going to come down to the cost of building the airplane,\" said Byron Callan of Merrill Lynch. \"This only increases the pressure on Airbus to restructure and restructure quickly.\"\nHe and other analysts said Airbus now might be more willing to take the risk needed to launch a new large jet to break Boeing's monopoly on the lucrative top end of the market.\nCiting increasing \"route fragmentation,\" especially across the Pacific Ocean, Boeing said it plans to focus its development efforts on new versions of the medium-sized 767 and 777 twin-engine models.\nBoeing already has begun offering an increased-capacity version of the 767 that could be launched with an initial order in the next few months.\nBoeing also is considering new versions of the 777 that would add both capacity and range.\n", "British Telecommunications will start talks with European regulators within the next week about its planned $20 billion merger with America's MCI after the deal was overwhelmingly backed by investors on Tuesday.\nMCI shareholders approved the ambitious deal two weeks ago, leaving regulatory clearance the last hurdle to the creation of Concert Plc -- a \"global supercarrier\" with annual revenues of more than 25 billion pounds ($40.5 billion) and 43 million customers.\nA BT spokesman said the company remained confident of winning a green light from both the European Commission, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice by autumn.\nBut he could not confirm speculation that Brussels might demand two minor concessions which include modifications to the two groups' dominant position in audio and video conferencing and guarantees that competition can have reasonable access to Concert's transatlantic facilities.\nThe EC is due to report by June 11 on BT's plans to buy the 80 percent it does not already own of MCI Communications Corp, the aggressive, U.S. long-distance operator that has become the second, long-distance carrier in the U.S. behind phone giant AT &amp; T Corp.\nAhead of expected regulatory approval, a resounding 98.5 percent of BT's 2.3 million shareholders backed the merger, sweeping aside concerns raised by some analysts that a 30 percent premium which BT is paying is a high price for control.\nThe deal creates the world's fourth largest telecoms group in terms of sales after Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT), America's AT&amp;T and Germany's Deutsche Telekom.\n\"I have reservations about the merger,\" said pensioner Stella Garton-Brown, who has been a small shareholder in BT since the company was privatised in 1984. \"I'm not always sure that bigger is best.\"\nBut powerful financial institutions, that own about 73 percent of BT, tend traditionally to back company boards.\nSome analysts put down a surge in BT's share price during key transatlantic roadshows over the last weeks to proof of support for what will be the biggest transatlantic deal in history. Others put the share price down to index-linked buying.\nSir Iain Vallance, the chairman of BT and co-chairman designate of Concert, told shareholders that because of the development of new technology and the globalisation of the booming $650 billion telecoms market, the merger would bring benefits that BT could not deliver alone.\nConcert combined the feistiness of the younger, fast-growing MCI with the stability of BT -- \"the world's best market defender coupled with the world's best market attacker\", he said.\nBT and MCI currently hold about six percent of the global telecoms market, which is expected to top one trillion dollars by 2000. But Vallance said: \"We want to go after the other 94 percent.\"\nConcert wants to provide clients around the globe with local, long distance, international and mobile phone services as well as multi-media, Internet-based services and systems integration for business clients.\nThe group plans to be represented in key countries across the world so it can focus on winning high-margin, multinational clients that analysts estimate account for about 15-20 percent of global telecoms revenue.\nA deal with MCI also opens up the world's largest telecoms market to BT -- the United States is home to 40 percent of the largest multinational company headquarters. BT also hopes to take a share of the lucrative local market through MCI as this is opened up to competition.\nMCI shareholders will receive 5.4 Concert shares for each MCI share and $6.0 cash. BT shareholders get a 2.2 billion pound special dividend and total dividend for this year of 19.85p.\nBT has promised that the merger, after an initial five percent earnings dilution, will yield savings from combining overlapping services of 1.5 billion pounds over the first five years and 500 million pounds pre-tax annually after that.\nBut merchant banks such as Robert Fleming are sceptical about company forecasts of a six percent annual dividend rise as increasing competition is set to dampen healthy call volumes and drive down prices nearer to the relatively marginal cost of delivering them.\nFleming says BT's gearing level might surge to 150 percent in the next three years and has downgraded its recommendation on BT to \"sell\" because it says the group's valuation looks stretched against other European telecom groups.\nThe merchant bank's gearing calculation includes a 1-1.2 billion pound windfall tax if Britain's opposition Labour Party wins the May 1 election and an approximate 1.6 billion pound acquisition of the remaining 40 percent of BT's mobile phone business Cellnet.\nIt also includes other investments in Europe and key Asia Pacific markets, where Concert has yet to build a large presence.

The flaw was officially dubbed the \"Flag Erratum\" by Intel, the world's biggest chip maker.\n\"Basically, an erratum is a design defect that may cause the product to deviate from published specifications,\" Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop said. \"All microprocessors have flaws in them.\"\nIntel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has been investigating the flaw since it was uncovered by an independent analyst last week.\nThe discovery caused concern among investors and customers because it came just four days before Intel launched the Pentium II, its biggest new product in years.\nSome investors feared the flaw could force Intel to replace tens of thousands of chips, as it did in 1994 due to a defect in the original Pentium chip.\nInternational Business Machines Corp. said the flaw should not have any major impact on its PC customers.\n\"We currently have no information to believe that this reported anomaly will have a major impact on our customers,\" said a spokesman for the IBM PC Co.\n\"We are continuing to ship product,\" a spokesman for Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. said. \"Every processor has some kind of errata. This is obviously one that Intel is working on. It's not a show stopper.\"\nThe Flag Erratum occurs when some programs try to convert so-called floating point numbers, or decimal numbers, into integers. In some cases, the chip makes rounding errors, and it does not raise a warning flag that it made the error.\nWaldrop said Intel would not judge how serious the flaw was, leaving that to computer makers and software developers. But Intel will help developers rewrite programs to compensate for the error when it does come up.\nThe Pentium Pro, a chip Intel began selling in November 1995, also has the defect.\nAt first glance, the flaw does not appear to be too serious because it had gone undetected in the Pentium Pro for 18 months, said Rick Doherty, a director at Envisioneering Group Inc., a market researcher company.\n\"We've got a year-and-half of work on this puppy and no one has reported a single problem with their applications yet,\" Doherty said.\n\"But it's not over yet,\" he said. \"This means that an IBM and a Microsoft will have to go through their software packages to see if things are affected by it.\"\nWaldrop said Intel will fix the defect in the new chips it makes. Investors apparently were not concerned about the flaw, as Intel rose 75 cents to $159.50 on Nasdaq.\n", "Eastman Kodak Co secured only a partial exit from bruising copier wars with a $684 million sale of its copier-marketing and service operations to Britain's Danka Business Systems Plc.\nPrompted by chronic financial weakness, highlighted by the fact Kodak's copier sales of $1.8 billion yield only $20 million in annual operating profits, the sale prompted segment leader Xerox Corp to throw down the gauntlet to Danka.\n\"They're on our turf now and are going to have to chase us to win business,\" said Xerox executive Gill Hatch.\nHatch predicted the Danka-Kodak deal on Monday would bring pricing pressures to the copier business. \"Suffice to say that Danka has been aggressive, and will continue to be aggressive,\" Hatch said.\nAccording to Danka chief executive Dan Doyle, the acquisition and a 10-year alliance with Kodak will give high-flying Danka a full line of copiers to offer low, middle and upmarket customers around the world.\nKodak is retaining its manufacturing and development operations in copiers, as well as some key technology.\nThe remaining Kodak businesses will have about $600 million a year in sales, or a third of its former turnover. Danka will be its main customer as the primary distributor of Kodak copiers and printers.\n\"Danka's growth will be our growth,\" said Kodak co-chief operating officer Carl Kohrt.\nKohrt predicted Kodak's rump copier businesses would be profitable by the end of 1997 and that the transaction, netting Kodak about $600 million in cash, would be immediately accretive to earnings. The deal should close by December 31.\nAnalyst Gary Schneider of Bear Stearns said he had hoped Kodak would have quit copiers entirely and will have to prove to Wall Street it can turn around the financial performance of the remaining copier businesses.\n\"The question is what kind of normalized earnings can you get out of those,\" he said.\nMonday's deal is just the latest bit of corporate trimming at Kodak, which has spun off and sold businesses, generating some $8 billion. The company has in the 1990s exited pharmaceuticals, household goods and chemicals.\nThe company said last winter it wanted to exit or reposition its copier businesses because its financial performance was subpar and promised little hope for a turnaround as it stood.\nKohrt said the deal with Danka will stimulate sales of Kodak copiers. \"What we've really needed is pull-through from the market,\" he said.\nDanka chief executive Dan Doyle said Kodak's strong focus on big customers needing high-volume copiers and services dovetailed with Danka's traditional presence among low and middle-market customers.\nNews of the deal boosted Danka's American Depositary Receipts, which closed up 6-5/8 at 36-1/2. Kodak closed down 1/2 at 71-3/4.\n", "As China winds down from a two-week Spring Festival holiday and warmer weather looms, Far East metals traders forecast on Monday that demand for Chinese base metals would begin to pick up.\nSome traders said physical tightness of some materials, especially copper and aluminium, would push premiums higher.\nA trader based in Hong Kong with a major Chinese metals producing firm said mainland customers who had bought three months ahead of the new year holiday were now clamouring for nearby delivery.\n\"I will have to contact the LME (London Metal Exchange) and arrange to borrow because they want their 300 tonnes before the end of this month,\" he said.\n\"We're expecting our customers to buy, though many are holding on for price falls,\" he said, adding that high LME prices should soon prompt a profit-taking related correction.\nTightness in the Chinese domestic market was immediately evident on the Shanghai Metal Exchange, which resumed trading on Monday after the Lunar New Year holidays.  \nShanghai copper futures were sharply higher with the most active May 1997 contract opening at 21,980 yuan ($2,648) per tonne, up 400 yuan. It rose further to its limit-up of 22,100 yuan per tonne early in the session.\nA source in Shanghai with a Western trading firm said the local exchange's stocks stood close to 20,000 tonnes, though this could hardly be considered high.\nAluminium futures also opened up, with the May contract first traded at 15,900 yuan per tonne, up 20 yuan.\nDips in the LME price of aluminium have prompted Chinese orders over the past two weeks, an industry executive said.\n\"My belief is that despite the fact that the Chinese were on holiday, there have been some Chinese orders going into the LME already,\" the executive said on condition of anonymity.\nA long-awaited correction in the aluminium price had brought Chinese buyers out of their holiday cocoon, he said, adding however that he had no details of Chinese orders.\nAluminium prices on the LME have whipsawed recently.

The PLA garrison might eventually be up to 10,000-strong, military sources say.\n\"The duties of advance personnel are to make practical preparations for the PLA to take over the responsibility for the defence of Hong Kong, including familiarisation with military sites, liaison with British forces and the Hong Kong government, and coordination of communications support,\" the spokesman said.\nThe group will be led by a deputy commander of the future Garrison, an officer of the rank of Major General.\nA 28-member liaison group led by the deputy commander will be located with British forces at the Prince of Wales Barracks in Central Hong Kong. The other 12 will be billeted with the British garrison on Stonecutters Island in Hong Kong harbour.\nThe PLA troops would wear uniforms within the barracks but civilian clothing outside military sites.\n\"They have to strictly abide by all Hong Kong laws,\" the spokesman said in an effort to allay fears among Hong Kong's 6.4 million population that the PLA would put itself above the law.\nThe PLA has a bad name in Hong Kong, where many people vividly remember how the Chinese army sent tanks into Beijing's Tiananmen Square and bloodily crushed a student-led democracy movement with a heavy loss of life.\nChina has reinforced those fears and memories with a series of moves designed to trim democracy and civil liberties in Hong Kong after the sovereignty change this year.\nIt has overridden British objections and appointed a new interim legislature to replace the elected Legislative Council on July 1, when 156 years of British rule come to an end and Hong Kong becomes a semi-autonomous capitalist region of China.\nIt has also launched moves to roll back laws on the freedom to demonstrate and form political parties, as well as democratic elections introduced by London in recent years.\nThe latest breakthrough came just as the mood was growing bleak in Sino-British handover negotiations.\nA move by Beijing on Monday to set the rules on who is entitled to permanent residency in Hong Kong after it reverts to China had stirred up a bitter quarrel.\n\"It's our domestic affair.

Seven said the result was achieved despite a softening in the advertising market.\nSales for the television network rose 16 percent to A$418.3 million for the half, boosted by advertising revenue from its coverage of the Atlanta Olympics last year and the acquisition of regional TV group Sunshine Broadcasting in December 1995.\nThe coverage of the Atlanta Olympics produced a small gross profit and it recorded an abnormal gain of A$3.2 million on the sale of Sunshine Broadcasting's radio asset, Seven said.\nRice said he was optimistic about meeting targets.\n\"I think we will meet our financial targets and I think our performance will be quite strong in every respect,\" he said.\n\"We have had a reasonable January, February is not bad.

But selling crude to Russian refineries or on the Russian spot market is loss-making.\"\nDespite an aggressive expansion programme, LUKoil, which accounted for nearly 20 percent of Russian oil production last year with output of 1.16 million barrels per day, sees home production rising by 2.4 percent this year.\nMost Russian oil companies face similar problems, and are struggling to turn the tide against output declines while calculating the value of increased output against export pipelines already filled to the limit.\nBut LUKoil, a favourite among foreign portfolio investors, in part due to its success in consolidating control over its production units, refiners and distributers, is the exception, not the rule, among Russia's newly-privatised oil companies.\n\"LUKoil's move abroad is correct,\" said the Western analyst. \"But its Russian competitors will not be able to do the same.\"\n", "The often-praised Czech economy may be starting to show cracks, as slower growth highlights concern over a widening trade gap and the pace of industrial restructuring, analysts said on Monday.\nOver the years, economists have hailed Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and his policies which have produced one of the lowest inflation rates in the region, good GDP growth and an unemployment rate of about three percent.\nMany of those same analysts, however, are now saying that while the economy is not yet in serious trouble, much remains to be done, particularly in industrial restructuring.\nThe latest round of bad news came on Monday, when the Czech Statistical Bureau released figures showing the trade balance finished 1996 with a record deficit of 160.33 billion crowns ($5.75 billion), up from a 95.7 billion crown shortfall the previous year.\nWhile most economists, after several mid-year revisions, had predicted the deficit, some are beginning to voice concerns over Czech industry's export competitiveness.\n\"As far as the export of our raw materials and semi-finished products are concerned, (the development) is very unfavourable over the last year,\" Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka said.\n\"We are undergrowing competition from other transforming economies. More and more we are unable to compete with some semi-finished products from Ukraine, for example, having in mind the average cost level with the Czech Republic,\" he added.\nSince 1992 the economy has moved from recession to 4.8 percent consumption-driven real growth in 1995, as inflation fell from double digits to below nine percent.\nUnemployment remains around three percent, and official statistics say nearly 70 percent of the economy is made by companies in, at least nominally, private hands.\nMost Czechs are fully employed, buying truckloads of western goods, and living in state-controlled housing.\nBut real economic growth has begun to wane, with third quarter GDP slowing to 3.6 percent, year-on-year, from 4.0 percent growth in the second quarter.\nAnd the spiralling trade deficit has put pressure on the current account, which showed a deficit of $3.1 billion crowns for the first three quarters according to the latest figures, while the capital account was in surplus by some $2.0 billion.\nMost analysts agree that a flood of funds since the beginning of the year -- an estimated 25-30 billion crowns have entered the country in crown-denominated Eurobonds alone -- should keep the situation from deteriorating this year.\nAnd, they add, foreign reserves are adequate.\nBut, said Janacek: \"The problem is if in the medium-term a continuing current account deficit of about eight percent of GDP is financeable or not.\"\nBoris Gomez of ING Barings said one problem is the lack of reliable data to chart whether the wave of imports, spurred mainly by raw material and machinery imports, will translate into economic restructuring.\nHe expects exports to become stronger this year as key west European markets wake up from their recent slumber, and other central European economies gain strength.\n\"The key period will be the end of this year when the trade deficit will have to have stabilised or there will be a lot of pressure,\" he said.\nAdded one London-based economist: \"You can get all of the imports you want, but then you have to do something with them.\n\"There are a lot of people who talk about how this (the imports) will help down the road, but the assumption here is huge -- that management actually knows what it is doing with all of its structural advantages,\" he said.\n($1=27.86 Czech Crown)\n", "China on Wednesday called for a solution to the crisis over a North Korean official holed up in Seoul's mission in Beijing, hinting for the first time the senior ideologue had sought refuge of his own free will.\nIn the first mention in its domestic media of the Cold War drama unfolding in its capital, China indicated that Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-il, had willingly sought refuge in Seoul's consular compound.\n\"After his arrival in Beijing on February 11, Hwang stayed at the (North Korean) embassy in Beijing,\" Xinhua said, quoting sources at the Foreign Ministry.\n\"He left there in the morning of the following day and ran away into the embassy of (South Korea) in Beijing,\" it said in a report broadcast on state radio.\nPyongyang, which previously maintained Hwang was kidnapped, has hinted it may be ready to give up attempts to win back the man ranked 24th in the North's hierarchy and the designer of its governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance.\n\"It is hoped that the relevant parties will, with a calm and objective attitude, judge the nature of this incident and work to seek a proper solution to it,\" Xinhua said.\nHwang remained stranded in Seoul's heavily guarded consular compound after talks between South Korean and Chinese officials failed to resolve his fate depite signs that Pyongyang was willing to soften its hardline stance.\n\"Unfortunately, we have not made any real progress in our talks with China,\" South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung said of moving Hwang, who took refuge in the embassy last Wednesday.\nBeijing has found itself an unwilling third party in the drama but has indicated it hopes the two Koreas can sort out the problem themselves. Officials in Seoul have said such a solution is impossible.\n\"We are telling the Chinese that there's no dialogue channel and it is impossible to resolve a sensitive defection issue in direct talks with the North,\" said a Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be identified.\nSouth Korean officials in Beijing said talks with Chinese officials were continuing but declined to comment on their content, saying only that a solution was likely take some time.\n\"But with North Korea changing its attitude, we hope there will be progress in our negotiations,\" the official said.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-il appeared to indicate Pyongyang's less hardline approach when he was quoted by state radio on Tuesday as saying \"cowards\" should get out.\nPyongyang said it would take strong action if it turned out Hwang was kidnapped but would fire him if he had turned traitor on his Stalinist homeland, a Foreign Ministry statement said.\nChina appeared nervous about Pyongyang's intentions, sending three armoured personnel carriers, a crowd control truck and armed police to guard the sedate streets around the mission while officials seek an end to the impasse.\n", "Talks aimed at averting a potentially crippling auto supplier strike at  American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Inc continued on Saturday morning after bargainers worked past the midnight Friday deadline.\n\"The folks are still there, they worked through the night,\" said a person close to the negotiations who asked not to be named. \"They seem in good spirits.\"\nA strike at American Axle would virtually shut down light truck production at General Motors Corp's 11 North American truck plants within days, and create more supply hardships for Ford Motor Co.\nUnited Auto Workers leaders have not officially extended the strike deadline, but they also have not authorized members to start picketing, union members said on Saturday.\nAbout 7,200 UAW members were poised to walk off their jobs at five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y., on Friday night if no agreement was reached on a new three-year contract.\nAmerican Axle, which was spun off from GM in 1994, supplies rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars, as well as various parts for other passenger car lines.\nThe company makes axle shafts that are used by Ford in its F-150 pickup trucks, Expedition and Explorer sport/utilities and some rear-drive passenger cars, although those supplies are not as critical as the GM parts. It also makes axles for a small number of Chrysler Corp. light truck products.\nTight inventories among axle suppliers means GM's light truck plants would run out of parts by early next week, analysts said. The world's largest automaker could lose after-tax profits of $20 million a day if it were forced to suspend light truck production, analysts said.\nAmerican Axle and the UAW are at odds over wages and other economic issues as the union seeks to impose on the company the same pattern contract the Big Three automakers agreed to for about 400,000 UAW members last fall.\nAutomakers guaranteed jobs for 95 percent of their current workforce in a contract that provides $2,000 lump sum payments in the first year and wage hikes of three percent in the second and third years. The pact allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $19.\nAmerican Axle, however, wants to start new hires at 60 percent of the base wage -- and extend the time it takes to reach the full rate to six years, union officials said. The Big Three pact has a \"grow-in\" rate of three years.\nBut if the company were forced to match the Big Three pattern it would be at a severe cost disadvantage against its competitors, a company spokesman has said.\nThe American Axle talks have drawn attention because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract.\nMeantime, a UAW strike against Johnson Controls Inc, a key seat supplier for Ford, entered its 19th day Saturday with no settlement.\n", "The president and 15 board members at Nomura Securities Co Ltd will resign to take responsibility for a racketeering scandal that has again sullied the name of Japan's biggest securities firm, the company announced on Tuesday.\nThe president, Masashi Suzuki, was appointed just a month ago after the resignation of his predecessor when the affair came to light.\nThe case is the latest to hit Japan's brokerage industry, where ties between companies and shadowy racketeers have long been a problem.\nProsecutors and the securities watchdog are investigating whether Nomura paid off the racketeer, known as \"sokaiya\", to avoid disruptions at its shareholders' meetings.\nJunichi Ujiie, a Nomura managing director who will take over as president on May 1, told a news conference that his aim will be to establish a more open management system based on clear rules.\nHe said there was an atmosphere inside the company that discouraged free discussion among executives.\nBut one analyst said the reshuffle should help the brokerage transform that culture.\n\"I think the resignation of many executives will have a good impact on Nomura as it will make it easier for new management to reform its corporate culture,\" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice-president of Smith Barney International Inc.\nIt was not the first time that Nomura has been embroiled in scandal. In 1991 it was punished by regulators for improperly favouring certain clients.\nIn a separate case, news reports on Monday linked Yamaichi Securities Co to illegal deals, sparking threats of libel action by the firm.\nSuzuki said that, while he had expected to transfer the company's management to the next generation after regaining public trust, Nomura's current situation was serious, requiring sweeping changes.\n\"Nomura is experiencing the worst crisis since it was founded,\" he said.\nHe said that Nomura was facing difficult problems, including continued investigation by regulators and expected administrative punishment by the Finance Ministry.\nHe also said Nomura's clients had increasingly been suspending business with the brokerage since the beginning of April and Nomura's employees were receiving complaints from customers.\nHideo Sakamaki, who resigned as Nomura's president last month when the scandal broke, said earlier on Tuesday that the company had paid more than 70 million yen ($555,000) via stock deals into accounts linked to a racketeer.\nSakamaki, who was testifying before a committee of the Upper House of parliament, said that one of the irregular stock deals included a transaction involving more than seven million shares in a commercial bank on March 15, 1993.\nIt was the first time a Nomura insider had publicly revealed the amount of money transferred to the racketeer.\nA Japanese news service reported on Tuesday that the Ministry of Finance was likely to suspend some of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as punishment for the scandal.\nAn official at Nomura, who declined to be named, said that he welcomed the reshuffle.\n\"While I feel sympathy for the people who have to resign, Nomura employees are welcoming the decision,\" he said.\nMorale at Nomura's branches has fallen since the scandal was revealed in March, but the sweeping executive reshuffle will help restore confidence in Nomura not only by investors but also by its employees, he said.

AT&amp;T said it stopped marketing those plans in 1993 when it introduced its \"True\" family of calling plans.\nHowever, rates on the True savings plans will also rise, an AT&amp;T spokesman confirmed, because they are based on a percentage discount from the basic rate.

In a call-back service, users first call a switching centre in the United States and calls are then connected at cost-effective U.S. rates.\nThe Tokyo call-back service marks the first time AT&amp;T has started such a service, AT&amp;T Asia/Pacific President John Legere said.\n\"We are the first major telecommunications carrier in Japan to introduce a low-cost, flat-rate international calling option,\" he said.\nAT&amp;T's Japanese unit said it would charge 240 yen ($2) for a three-minute call to Canada or the United States from Tokyo, compared with the 450 yen ($3) Japanese customers now pay.\nThe service, which will at first be offered only to business customers in Tokyo, could be used for sending data and faxes, Legere said.\n", "Hundreds of mining prospectors, armed with axes and machetes, are racing through swamps and thick brush in remote Northern Ontario this week in one of the largest staking rushes in decades.\nThe Ontario government invited prospectors to explore a 617,500-hectare area in the Temagami region, making the land available for the first time in 23 years.\nBut there was a shortage of experienced prospectors in the area, so big companies trained local high school track teams to fill in.\n\"There's a lot of potential,\" provincial government geologist Elaine Basa said. \"It's an area that hasn't been open to new technology. It's like virgin territory and that's what's exciting to a lot of people.\"\nUp to 600 prospectors, many of them hired by international mining companies, have been clambering across the rugged Canadian Shield, hoping to find gold or base metals.\nThe parcel of land is not far from existing gold mines and old copper and base metal mines, Basa said.\n\"That's why it's such a big target,\" she said. \"A lot of people want a piece of the pie.\"\nThe Ontario government closed off the area in 1973 after a local Indian band laid claim to the land. The claim was struck down in 1991 and the government eventually decided to open the area to logging and exploration again -- despite raucous protests from environmentalists.\nMajor international mining companies, small explorers and independent prospectors have flocked to the rocky Canadian Shield. Most spent the weekend camping in the bush, preparing for what many saw as the chance of a lifetime.\nProspectors must follow strict rules to stake their claims.\n\"You physically have to define the boundaries out in the field,\" said Roy Denomme, a government mining recorder.\nThe race started Tuesday morning, with prospectors sprinting through the thick bush to pound a huge stake in each corner of the property. Between each stake, they had to blaze a boundary by marking trees with their axes along the way.\nSome prospectors spent the weekend hiding stakes in the thick forest near the claim corners, hoping to get an edge on their competitors, said Basa.\nThe first person to stake all four corners and file a claim wins the rights to the property. Prospectors have 31 days to file their claims.\nBasa expects a lot of wheeling and dealing in the next few days as the powerful mining companies manoeuvre for the best properties.\nToronto-based Falconbridge Ltd. sent a team of prospectors to the area in helicopters.\n\"It's a real crap shoot,\" said Paul Severin, vice president of exploration for Falconbridge, whose huge copper-zinc Kidd Creek mine is in nearby Timmins, Ontario.\n", "British chemicals group Albright &amp; Wilson Plc said on Thursday that it planned to focus its business increasingly on emerging markets, with particular emphasis on South America, China and India.\n\"These are very important for the growth of Albright &amp; Wilson,\" chief executive Robin Paul told Reuters in an interview.\nPaul, who steered the company back onto the stock market in 1995 after 17 years as part of Tenneco Inc, said expansion was likely to come through partnerships and the acquisition of majority stakes in partner companies where appropriate.\nLast year Albright &amp; Wilson took a majority stake in an Indian partner, and is now stepping up its activities in phosphates and surfactants there. The company, which announced a 13.6 percent rise in 1996 pre-tax profits, also said it had appointed Gabriel Kow as president of its Asia Pacific operations. Kow joins the group from Glaxo Wellcome Plc.\n\"We continue to believe China is a very important region for Albright &amp; Wilson,\" said Paul, who said Kow had \"a very good understanding of China and its markets.\"  \nThe company said 1996 produced \"a satisfactory result in an environment that has offered little assistance in the various markets in which the group operates.\" Paul said rises in raw material prices, which added 40 million stg to costs in 1995, had stabilised, with just four million stg added to costs last year.\nIn the key phosphates business, which goes into products ranging from soft drinks to washing powders, sales rose eight percent to 361.1 million stg, including associate companies, but operating profits fell 7.5 percent to 47.0 million stg, with margins down to 13.0 percent from 15.2 percent.  \nAlbright &amp; Wilson is the world's largest producer of wet phophoric acid. Paul said phosphates had been affected by \"a number of special factors\" in 1996, including higher Chinese phosphorus prices and costs and distortions linked to capacity increases and refurbishment of plants in England and Mexico.\n\"These factors are largely behind us,\" said Paul. \"Chinese phosphorous prices have started to come down compared to the middle of 1996.\" Demand was strong: \"We are sold out in phosphates,\" he said.  \nPaul said promised progress had been made in both the surfactants business, which supplies wetting and foaming agents for items like toiletries and detergents, and in specialty chemicals, whose products include flame retardants and chemicals for water treatment.\nAt surfactants operating profits leaped 76 percent to 14.1 million stg last year on sales of 309.0 million stg, with margins rising to 4.6 percent from 2.5 percent. Paul said the division was on target to achieve margins of between six and eight percent \"by the end of this year.\"\nAt Specialties, where the group is targeting margins of 15 percent, operating profits rose 33 percent to 16.9 million stg on sales of 187.5 million, with margins improving to 9.0 percent from 6.6 percent.\nPaul said the strength of sterling had little impact on 1996 results. In 1997 Paul noted that \"some people are talking about a 10 percent (impact) on profits if these rates continue for the whole year,\" but he added that this did not take into account the company's efforts to contain costs and a beneficial impact from lower raw material prices.\nThe chief executive said the group was slightly ahead on its goal of generating 20 percent of sales from new products by 1998, noting the successful launch of a biocidem Tolcide THPS, during 1996.\nPaul, who retires from the board in July, said the company wanted to \"keep the option\" of buying back shares.

It should be sustainable for 1997,\" said Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber.\nHowever, the share prices of the group continue to reflect investors worries about looming competition in the Bell's core local markets and how well they will do in long distance.\n\"The big issue is competition and when does that have an impact,\" Klugman said. In the meantime, booming demand continues to show up at the Bells' bottom line.\n\"Both Bell Atlantic and NYNEX reported better expected than results compared to analysts' consensus,\" said Bill Vogel, an analyst at brokers Dillon Reed.\nSBC was a cent below the First Call consensus of $0.91 for the fourth quarter, but SBC chief financial officer Don Kiernan said that this was less when rounding errors were removed. The 1996 consensus of $3.46 was hit dead on.\n\"Its really much closer (to fourth quarter consensus) than it looks,\" Kiernan told Reuters.\nAnalysts were sanguine about SBC's performance.\n\"Generally SBC met aggressive expectations for revenue. Expenses were higher than we expected, but offset by a lower tax rate and a $22 million revenue boost from a regulatory change,\" said Bill Deatherage of brokers Bear Stearns.\nDeatherage said the higher expenses seem to have come from Internet and data transport initiatives, investment for long distance services and Americast.\nAmericast is a venture with Walt Disney Co, GTE Corp, BellSouth Corp, Ameritech Corp, and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp to produce media content for interactive and multimedia networks.\nKlugman said that NYNEX was pulled back a little by the relative weakness of the north eastern economy, and had reined in its marketing spending as a result of service penalties.\n\"I don't think they have had the opportunity to harvest the full benefits of the change in regulatory regime (to price cap from rate of return),\" he said.\nHowever, Vogel noted that NYNEX had made a first.\n\"For NYNEX it was the first back-to-back years with double-digit earnings growth,\" he said.

That reduced NAV growth because of the absence of unrealised gains but increased operating profits because the higher yield comes through in investment income.\nThe company's NAV of 723 pence per share was some 30 pence below market expectations, said Hudson, and the shares slipped five pence to 958 pence by late morning.\n\"It's a question of trying to weigh up the fact that profit expectations will be raised but NAV expectations have been disappointed,\" said Hudson.\nThe strong operating performance, if repeated across the industry as a whole would raise the prospect of a prolonged downturn in the insurance cycle, with rates remaining under pressure.\nGeneral Accident described trading as \"competitive\" over the quarter and while it had implemented premium increases in personal and commercial motor classes, elsewhere rates were static.\nThe focus going forward was on maintaining the improvement in its underwriting performance, chief executive Bob Scott told Reuters.\n\"We've seen growth in original currencies of about four percent in the quarter and we've got to keep that pushing ahead,\" said Scott.\nWorldwide underwriting results improved by 50 million pounds over the period while weather costs fell by 30 million pounds - four million pounds in the UK and 20 million pounds in the U.S.\nThe company maintained underwriting profitability in the UK while underlying trends in the U.S. and Canada improved.\nIn Britain, the first of a series of rating increases in personal motor planned for 1997 of 3.2 percent was implemented on April 1. Further rises are being considered.\nCommercial rates were increased by eight percent.\n\"All the evidence is that private motor rates are moving up. The Automobile Association (AA) survey indicates they're definitely moving after a three or four year period when they've been in decline. Commercial motor is following a similar pattern,\" Scott said.\n\"There are some signs on content that rate increases may be being thought about but generally the weather has been good and the homeowners account hasn't suffered unduly.\"\nBut General Accident had seen a 50 percent increase in subsidence claims to two million pounds, although it was too early to say whether it was going to be as bad as it was in 1991, he said.\nAfter absorbing the integration costs of Provident Mutual in 1996, life profits were up 45 percent to 32 million pounds.\nSales of life and pension products were up 9.5 percent overall with the profitability of new business continuing to grow.\nNew UK single premium business grew by 18 percent to 253 million pounds.\n\"We're concentrating on writing profitable new business in life.

By focusing its marketing on the new product, Informix neglected its older, better-selling products.\nIt reported a first-quarter loss of $140.1 million, or 93 cents, on revenue of $133.7 million. Sales declined 34 percent in the first quarter.\nThe huge loss slashed Informix's cash supply in half to $120.6 million from $261 million, the company said. Part of the decline also was due to a $61.5 million cash deposit with Banque Nationale de Paris, which provided the financing for the Santa Clara land.\nInformix's financial trouble also has raised speculation that the company is a candidate for an acquisition by a larger software vendor, possibly Computer Associates International Inc. or Netscape Communications Corp., analysts said.\nIn late afternoon, Informix shares were up $2.19 at $11.50 on trading of 17 million shares on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue.\nAn Informix spokesman declined to comment about the takeover speculation.\n", "Britain's opposition Labour party said on Monday that it believed problems at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) could have been uncovered earlier and warned other financial institutions to be more vigilant.\n\"The preliminary indications are the problem was not determined as soon as it should have been,\" said Alistair Darling, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.\n\"Alarm bells ought to be ringing in all major institutions. They should ask themselves if something similar could have happened,\" Darling said in a telephone interview.\nTrading in the three funds, which were worth an estimated 1.4 billion pounds ($2.18 billion), was suspended last week when MGAM, part of the giant Deutsche Bank group, disclosed suspected irregularities in the funds and began a probe.\nThe problems centre on the valuation of the high proportion of speculative unlisted high-technology stocks held in the funds.\nTrading in the three funds resumed last Thursday after a 180 million pound cash injection by Deutsche.\nPeter Young, the fund manager of two of the funds, was suspended and an injunction obtained by MGAM and Royal Bank of Scotland, trustee of the funds, to freeze his assets.\nAn in-depth probe spearheaded by investment watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) is underway, and it has brought in accountants to work out how much compensation may be due to the 90,000 investors in the funds.\nDarling said the problems at MGAM showed the regulatory system was not perfect and there were still problems to be addressed, both by regulators and businesses.\n\"Good regulatory sense and good business sense go hand-in-hand,\" Darling said, adding that every large organisation should be asking itself if similar irregularities could occur within their own structures.\nWhile the Labour party stood by its proposals to make the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) directly responsible for regulating Britain's financial community, it would not make any recommendations on the latest episode until IMRO had completed its investigation into the matter.\n\"The central question which IMRO needs to look at is how was it possible for these problems to arise,\" Darling said.\nThe fact that a succession of such problems were blamed on a so-called \"rogue trader\" or dealer was also a concern, as it raised the question of how those charged with compliance or those in senior management could miss such dealings.\n\"I'm concerned that when things go wrong the finger is pointed at a rogue activity. Ideally we want a system where it is simply not possible for one or two people to stray off the path,\" Darling said.\nHe also said the role of trustees of funds was a matter of concern, adding it was important to find a way of ensuring they are not only independent but constantly vigilant.\nThe role of a trustee is to represent the interests of investors and to ensure a fund is managed according to its mandate.\n\"The public needs to be confident that these funds are properly managed,\" he said.\n($1=.6412 Pound)\n", "Holding company Cie de Suez  and utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux SA are expected to announce a merger deal on Friday, effectively ending the independence of the company created in the 19th century to build the Suez Canal.\nThe boards of the two companies will meet on Friday to approve terms of the link-up, which has already received the backing of the Lyonnaise board.\nLyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod said last Thursday that the merger with Suez was an excellent plan but the terms had not yet been fixed.\nHowever, a source close to the merger talks told Reuters on Thursday that the share parity to be used would be 41 Suez shares for every 20 Lyonnaise shares.\nSuez stock was down 0.04 percent at 282.90 francs ($48.79) on volume of 171,495 shares, while Lyonnaise was down 0.37 percent at 540. The market was off 0.63 percent.\nSuez would also pay out either 3.6 or 3.8 billion francs for the 1996 dividend, the source added.\nThe deal would mark the end of autonomy for Suez, which fell victim in the 1990s to a troubled property market.\nIt was founded in 1858 by Ferdinand de Lesseps to build and operate the property asset which symbolised the glory of the French Empire and engineering, the Suez Canal.\nDiscontented Suez shareholders forced out the previous chairman, Gerard Worms, after the group reported a four billion franc ($690 million at current rates) loss in 1995 and installed Gerard Mestrallet to turn round the sprawling conglomerate.\nMestrallet quickly sold crown jewels such as investment bank Banque Indosuez and fund manager Gartmore. The ailing real estate portfolio was also disposed of, leaving Suez with more than five billion francs in cash.\nBut he held on to a 63 percent stake in Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB) which groups some choice industrial and financial assets.\nSGB welcomed Suez as a white knight in the late 1980s when it was being stalked by Italian businessman Carlo de Benedetti, who saw it as ripe for takeover.\nNow it looks as if SGB could be the saviour for Suez. Stock market analysts say that if there is any industrial logic in the merger, it lies in Mestrallet's focus on the utilities sector and abandoning financial services.\nSGB has a 37 percent stake in Tractebel, which specialises in electricity, gas, water and environmental services. It has operations in cable television, property, infrastructure and industrial installations -- areas which overlap with Lyonnaise.\nLyonnaise, under veteran chairman Monod, has set its sights on international expansion in utilities but lacks the financial muscle to fund that growth.\nA link-up would inject fresh capital from Suez's cash hoard -- even after the special dividend to sweeten Suez shareholders on the merger.\nMonod said last week that a merged Suez/Lyonnaise would be a multi-service company on a global scale and capable of boosting profits and cashflow.\nMonod said earlier this week, he expected Mestrallet to head the executive board of the merged company while Monod himself would head the supervisory board and handle strategy.

Lack of machinery made reclamation of sand-covered arable land difficult.\nNorth Korea was \"very exposed\", he said, adding that floods and hailstorms could strike again.\nPyongyang's arch-rival South Korea has been one of the 25 donor countries, pledging 1,000 (corrects from 100,000) tonnes of wheat flour and 15,000 pairs of socks.\n\"South Korea is coming in very big this year,\" he said.\nSeoul suspended food shipments to North Korea after accusing Pyongyang of landing 26 commandos from a submarine last September.

Production has outstripped demand, leading to overheated competition, price wars and mounting losses among state firms.\nAdding to the problems of motorcycle manufacturers, some regional governments, alarmed at traffic congestion and air pollution, have discouraged motorcycle purchases by curbing the issue of licence plates.\nTIGHT MONETARY POLICY TO BLAME\nTian also blamed the company's woes on the government's tight monetary policy to rein in galloping inflation.\n\"The motorcycle market shrank...because people have less money...and less buying power,\" he said.\nTight monetary policy has also resulted in triangular debt, or debt owed among state-owned firms, and cash flow problems.\n\"Debts owed to each other are very serious...We can't get our money back for motorcycles sold,\" Tian said.\nJialing's collectibles soared to 700 million yuan in 1996.\nThe company has formed debt collection squads and aims to reduce collectibles to 300 million yuan by end-1997. Collectibles were virtually non-existent in 1994.\nSTRUGGLING TO REMAIN NUMBER ONE\nThe climb to the top is hard. Staying on top is even harder.\nA price war has forced Jialing to slash prices by an average of 13 percent in 1997, Tian said.

It has not imposed a transaction tax on any regional derivative warrants or convertible bonds.\nHong Kong stock exchange chief executive Alec Tsui said on Wednesday the exchange was publishing a monthly report on the latest developments supporting the listing and trading of convertible bonds or derivative warrants on underlying securities listed on 15 regional exchanges.\nThey are Tokyo, Osaka, Korea, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Jakarta, Australia, New Zealand, Bombay and the National Stock Exchange of India, Tsui said.\n-- Hong Kong News Room (852) 2843 6470\n", "Gold output from Ivory Coast's second mine, SOMIAF, is set to double over the next two years and could rise further as sulphide deposit studies are completed, an operations manager said on Thursday.\n\"We just started on a (350,000 tonne) new gold oxide lens which will take over a year to mine,\" operations manager Joe Hinzer told Reuters. \"We have a second lens close to it which we plan to blend in which could take one and half years.\"\nSOMIAF (Societe des Mines d'Afema) announced two new oxide deposits totalling 510,000 tonnes with a gold content of up to 4.5 grammes/tonne in early April after commissioning a doubling of factory capacity last month.\nGold production is set to rise to 935 kilos in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) from 600 kilos in 1995/96 -- with calendar year yields of 950 kilos (1997) and 622 (1996), Hinzer said.\nOutput could reach 1,000-1,300 kilos in 1997/98 and continue rising if new sulphide deposits under study for at least two more years proved to be exploitable, he said.\nSOMIAF, is 68 percent-ownded by Canada's Eden Roc, with another 32 percent held by Ivory Coast. It owns one permit (120 sq km) and manages two nearby exploration sites (1,380 sq km) for a joint venture between state mining group Sodemi and Eden Roc.\nOxide deposits were being reassessed after recent management changes Hinzer said in an interview this week, putting total recoverable oxide gold at 500,000 ounces.\n\"We are counting the marbles now but about 30 percent of that is proven, probable or possible\" he said.\nAverage ore grade from the latest oxide deposit to be worked would mean an average 1997 gold grade of 5 g/t at leach pads against 1.9 g/t last year, said Hinzer.\nSOMIAF, which employs 350 permanent and 150 temporary staff invested $10-12 million to get operations underway in 1992.\nEden Roc's new president Mario Caron will officially take control of SOMIAF during a visit pencilled in for May, said Hinzer.\nStudies of gold suphide deposits are already advanced.\nA $10 million pre-feasibility sulphide study could be completed in two to three years but the cost of a new plant to handle sulphide ore, on top of recent oxide capacity expansion, could reach $35-40 million, said Hinzer.\n\"There are no hard numbers but we hope to identify 3-3.5 million ounces of gold. When we have the figures we can move on to feasibility and factory plans,\" he added.\n\"We have drilled over 1,000 holes, or 82,000 metres,\" he added. \"Before feasibility studies we would need to put in another 40,000 metres of tests.\"\nPromising areas lay along a broken 12 km strike within SOMIAF's exisitng permits, which in Ivory Coast are issued for three years and are renewable twice for two years.\nOxide mining is open cast but sulphide deposits could mean ramp mining or other deeper deposit recovery techniques.\nIvory Coast's largest mine, Societe des Mines d'Ity (SMI), is also planning to dig deeper for growth, SMI president Yves Palanque told Reuters.\n\"We will reach the water table in two years and will need to buy new equipment to deal with wet mining,\" said Palanque.\nSub-contractors mine the site but in two years SMI will take direct control over operations.\nProduction is running at 1.5 tonnes of pure gold per annum with 7.5 tonnes produced since 1991 and reserves put at 27 tonnes. Exploration to raise gold output is focused on a nearby 900 square km block.\nIvory Coast is keen to develop mining to broaden its agriculture-based economy and opened a Mines Commission this week to cut red tape for investors and prospectors.\nAround 55 exploration permits have been issued to a total of up to 25 firms, many of which have arrived since the introduction of a new mining code in 1995.\n-- Abidjan newsroom, + 225 21 90 90\n", "China has pledged to edge open its insurance, stock, retail, wholesale and banking sectors to foreign investment as part of a drive for long-delayed entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\n\"From 1997-2000, China is expected to open its insurance and stock market wider to foreign investment,\" the China Daily said on Sunday, quoting Ma Jixian, an official of the State Economic and Trade Commission under the cabinet.\nThe pledge was contained in a unilateral action plan submitted by China to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the Philippines last month, the newspaper said.\nBefore the end of the decade, foreign insurers would have access to markets outside Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Ma said without elaborating.\nChina's insurance market was once virtually monopolised by the state-owned People's Insurance Group but the sector has gradually opened up to domestic as well as foreign competition.\nOnly three foreign insurers are able to write insurance policies in China, including American International Assurance Co Ltd, a part of the American International Group Inc.\nThe others are Japan's Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co Ltd and which has a life insurance joint venture with a domestic insurer.\nMa, one of China's representatives at the APEC summit, said foreign stock companies would be allowed to handle A shares, whose availability is still confined to native Chinese. He gave no further details.\nCurrently, foreign investors are restricted to buying B shares, while Chinese nationals can only buy A shares.\nIn its action plan, China also pledged to cut its average import tariffs to about 15 percent from the current 23 percent.\nThe tariffs would be reduced futher in subsequent years, Ma said without going into details.\n\"A majority of non-tariff measures will have been abolished by 2010 and all those incompatible with World Trade Organisation rules will have been erased by 2020,\" Ma said.\nChina has pushed to gain entry to the WTO on the favourable terms of a developing nation, but Western countries, particularly the United States, have insisted its economy is too big for such preferential treatment.\nAccording to the action plan, China would allow foreign banks to open more operational outfits in 24 Chinese cities and launch pilot bases where foreign banks can conduct yuan business, the newspaper said.\nIn the first decade of the next century, foreign banks would be allowed to expand their presence beyond the current 24 pilot cities and more pilot bases would be available for them to conduct yuan business, it said.\nChina would let overseas retailers establish more joint venture or cooperative retailing chains in areas beyond the 11 pilot cities currently allowed, the newspaper said.\nThe liberalisation would cover all provincial capitals and major economic cities by the year 2010, the newspaper said, adding that foreign retailers would be free to open outlets in China by 2020.\nForeign investors would be allowed larger stakes in China's power sector and have greater access to China's river, marine and road transportation if Beijing becomes a member of the WTO, it said.\nChina would further open its tourism sector, allowing joint venture travel agencies in five cities on an experimental basis over the next three years, the newspaper said.\n", "On the Internet, where new products come and go in the blink of an eye, time is said to move at \"Internet speed.\"\nBut in the rarefied air of Congress, where legislation often moves at a glacial pace, few would equate \"Washington time\" with the speed of cyberspace. That may be changing, however, as Congress struggles to come to grips with the Net as a phenomenon with great potential for reaching voters.\nIn the 1996 election, exit polls showed more than one-fourth of voters were \"wired\" and about 10 percent primarily used online sources of information in deciding how to vote. Responding to the surge in Net use by voters, congressional Internet use also has skyrocketed by some measures.\nAt the begining of 1994, just a handful of lawmakers had posted home pages on the World Wide Web. Two years later, 222 representatives and 85 senators had Web pages. The Congressional Internet Caucus has 91 members, up from 60 in the last Congress.\nDespite the flurry of activity, Congress will never be on the cutting edge, according to some who work in the capital.\n\"I expect Congress will always be one or many steps behind,\" Chris Casey, who helped set up the first congressional Web page for Sen. Edward Kennedy, told a briefing about the Web for congressional staff sponsored by the Internet caucus last week.\nA question about when Congress would be \"up to speed\" on the Net brought peals of laughter from the audience of staffers.\nBEYOND WEB PAGES\nNonetheless, some legislators have gone beyond posting simple Web pages and have integrated the Net into the most basic operations of their congressional offices. Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat whose district encompasses Silicon Valley, created a special area on her Web site to give constituents individualized information (http://www-eshoo.house.gov). A constituent sends Eshoo a query and receives a personal answer posted on a private part of the site accessible only to that individual with a password.\nSen. Pat Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, participates in live online chat sessions with school children in his home state with transcripts on his Web site (http://www.senate.gov/leahy). Leahy's office also is planning to start a newsgroup, a type of group mailing list on the Net, devoted to Vermont issues.\nAlmost all legislators accept electronic mail but most respond on paper through the mail. Leahy's office is one of the few that answer e-mail with e-mail, staffer Paul Mann said. Although some feared this might overwhelm the office with too many messages, \"surprisingly it hasn't happened,\" Mann said.\nFor the co-chairman of the Internet Caucus, Rep. Rick White, the Internet is a key foundation of his media strategy.\n\"The first place we send any press release is to our Web page,\" White staffer Aaron Weissman told the Web information session. Even media staff for the Washington state Republican Party look to the Web site (http://www.house.gov/white) to find copies of a release to send to the media, Weissman added.\nThe Internet is also changing the way groups lobby Congress. The Citizen's Internet Empowerment Coalition set up a Web page to get Internet users to send e-mail to Congress on the issue of restricting obscenity on the Net (http://www.ciec.org).\nBut since legislators are most interested in hearing from voters in their own districts, the page looks up the e-mail address of an Internet user and guides users to send targeted messages. \"We have a responsibility as advocates to educate Internet users,\" said Jonah Seiger of the Center for Democracy and Technology, which helped set up the coalition's site.\nMuch more remains to be done to educate users and legislators. While the text of bills is available online, some advocates want Congress to make more information available.\n\"There are broad sections of the electorate that are entirely uninformed about what our Congress does,\" Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional Accountability Project, said. \"So much of the problem is that it is very, very difficult to obtain in real time the core documents of our democracy.\"\nRuskin urged that Congress post an assortment of documents on the Web, including voting records, disclosure forms, testimony from hearings and draft legislation.\n", "The Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate Friday posted profits of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) for the second year running -- but warned that profits would fall for at least the next two years.\nThe insurance market, which last year only just succeeded in pushing through a rescue package after the billions of pounds of losses run up between 198nd 1992, also said its future focus would be on customers.\n\"For too long, Lloyd's has been obsessed with its capital base. We need to get back to basics,\" said Chief Executive Ron Sandler.\nThat meant providing customers with the best service and developing international trading opportunities, he said.\nLloyd's results are reported three years in arrears, and for 1994 profits once again topped the billion-pound mark at 1.01 billion pounds ($1.6 billion).\nThat fell just short of 1993's record level of 1.08 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) and was in line with forecasts.\nCorporate members, who were introduced to the market in 1994 following the near-disastrous losses which threatened to sink Lloyd's, will share in the profits for the first time.\nCorporate capital now provides some 44 percent of the market's capacity, a figure that is forecast to increase further in the future.\nSandler described the 1994 results as \"extremely satisfactory\" but said there was no sign of an end to the downward trend in premium rates.\nThat decline, a product of competition in insurance markets worldwide, is expected to have a significant impact on profits in the next few years.\nAn aggregate of individual syndicate forecasts suggests profits will fall to around 900 million pounds in 1995 ($1.5 billion) and 600 million ($980 million) in 1996.\nThe 1995 figure is ahead of projections made this time last year despite the adverse movement in currencies, but the slide in rates is expected to take its toll in subsequent years.\nLloyd's chairman, Sir David Rowland, admitted 1997 results would be under pressure from the decline and said he hoped brokers would \"sit on their hands when offered business at crazy rates.\"\nThe 1994 figures were a result of generally good market conditions and the exercise of much-sharpened skills in pricing and the setting of terms by Lloyd's underwriters, he said.\nThey were also helped because of fewer catastrophes, he added, though currency effects reduced profits by around 100 million pounds ($164 million).\nLloyd's returned to profit 12 months ago following five years of record losses totalling more than 8 billion pounds ($13 billion).\nThose losses were reinsured into a separate company, Equitas, a central plank in Lloyd's \"reconstruction and renewal\" plan which ensured the 300-year old insurance market's survival.\nThe reinsurance of 1992 and prior liabilities have transformed Lloyd's position, Sandler said, and clients could be confident that Lloyd's security ranked alongside the best in the world.\n", "China has scored new successes in its fight against inflation and economists said on Friday that price rises this year could be well below target.\nSome economists say inflation has been squeezed out of the economy with only a modest impact on growth as economic expansion continued at a fairly rapid pace.\n\"This is better than expected,\" said Chen Dezun, head of the price research institute of the State Planning Commission.\n\"We could see inflation of between three and four percent this year,\" he told Reuters. The benchmark retail price index rose a meagre 1.7 percent in March and 2.6 percent for the first quarter of the year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.\nChina forecast a 6.0 percent rise in retail prices this year after a 6.1 percent increase last year. That was already well below the 14.8 percent recorded in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.\nChina's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent in 1996.\nThe inflation figure for the first quarter was also below an estimate by Premier Li Peng this week that retail price inflation would average 3.0 percent in the January-March period.\nChen said good weather had been a factor, ensuring steady supplies of agricultural goods and keeping prices down.\nWhat China officially refers to as \"appropriately tight\" monetary policies had also been a crucial factor, he said.\n\"The appropriately tight monetary policies are now showing results,\" he said.\nChina has kept controls on fixed asset investment, keeping government spending down, and that has kept a cap on the demand for goods such as construction materials.\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the real rise in fixed asset investment last year was a fairly modest 11.5 percent.\n\"The key has been control over fixed asset investment,\" said Zhong Jiyun, an economist at the state think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\nSome economists have argued that with the battle against inflation proceeding favourably, China can now afford to ease its monetary policies.\nMany inefficient state-run enterprises are swimming in red ink and saddled with debt they cannot repay.\nManagers of these companies and their local government officials have called for easier credit to help to reduce their heavy financial burden.\nBut Zhong is among the economists who believe that China is not yet able to declare the war on inflation over.\n\"I believe we still need to keep the controls on,\" he said.\n", "A plan on how the Czech Republic will diversify natural gas supplies, now coming solely from Russia, has been delayed for several weeks, the Industry and Trade Ministry said on Tuesday.\n\"We are gathering information, analysing it, and it's going to take several weeks (before a the issue is put before the government),\" ministry Spokesman Miroslav Konvalina told Reuters.\nA plan had been expected to be submitted to the government sometime in January. Konvalina gave no reason for the delay.\nOfficials have declined to say which partners the government was considering, though government representatives have held talks on limited deliveries from Norway.\nThe Ministry is drawing up plans for four options for securing gas supplies, but has given no details. No matter which plan is excepted, Russia is expected to remain the dominant supplier.\nThe Ministry said the four options are being considered:\n* Purchasing all natural gas from Gazprom, using two different shipping routes, with a long-term agreement until 2016, with price guarantees until 1998.\n* Purchasing some Russian gas indirectly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and Germany's Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF. Gasunie would start supplies in 1998, delivering up to two billion cubic metres in 2005, with the agreement lasting until 2014.\nIn case of a fall in Russian supplies, it would deliver its own gas through Wingas, a joint venture of Wintershall (65 percent) and Gazprom (35 percent).\nWintershall offers a similar scheme, with deliveries starting on January 1 next year, rising to one billion cubic metres in 2000, under a deal until 2016. Negotiations with these firms are in the stage of initiating a supply contract.\n* Finalising and maintaining the agreement for Norwegian gas, which has already been preliminarily approved this year, until 2017.\n* A limited purchase from Mobil Europe Gas Inc, Germany's Brigitta Erdgas und Erdoel (BEB) and British Gas Plc.\nThe Czechs have ended their dependance on Russian crude oil by building a new pipeline to Germany, but are still completely dependant on supplies provided by Russia's Gazprom.\nThe Czech Republic consumes around eight to nine billion cubic metres of natural gas per year, but volumes are expected to rise to some 12-13 billion cubic metres by the turn of the century.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "Chrysler Corp Vice Chairman Robert Lutz, who recently throttled back on his corporate responsibilities, said Tuesday he still sees himself as an integral part of Chrysler's product creation activities.\n\"I don't see that anything changed,\" Lutz told Reuters in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show. As of January 1, Lutz gave up his president and chief operating officer titles to become vice chairman in anticipation of his 65th birthday in February.  \nAlthough Lutz is largely credited with turning around Chrysler's product development operations by instituting a system of super-efficient \"platform teams\" to bring each new vehicle to market, he said he rarely gives orders to subordinates.\nHe said he will continue to act as a coach and mentor for the engineers and product executives responsible for new products.\nLutz said he and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton \"are really more cheerleaders and coaches rather than the captain of the team that's out on the field actually playing.  \nEaton took over Lutz's chief operating officer duties and now has several executive vice presidents reporting directly to him.\nLutz said the new structure will give Eaton a chance to work more closely with the executive vice presidents, which will ease the transition to the next generation of leadership. He declined to comment on which executive vice presidents -- who include product development chief Thomas Gale, international chief Francois Castaing and sales and marketing chief James Holden -- have the best shot at succeeding the 57-year-old Eaton as the company's next chief executive.  \nLutz said he will probably stay at Chrysler for at most two \"I have to use to use this transitional period to ease myself out gradually, because the harsh reality is that I cannot stay around until I'm 70,\" he said. \"I would be seriously worried about a company that had its product fortunes guided by a 70-year-old guy. That usually results in cars directed at 70-year-olds.\"\nLutz said he will probably become less involved in Chrysler's manufacturing operations, but will probably spend more time visiting Chrysler's international operations, an area in which he has more expertise.\n", "Australia's Prime Minister arrives in China on Friday to redefine Canberra as a friend of Beijing, which less than a year ago accused Australia of being party to U.S. attempts to contain China, business sources said.\nJohn Howard wants to let China know that the business of Australia is business, said Bruce Dover, general manager of PDN-Xinren Information Technology Co, a joint venture of media giant News Corp and Chinese Communist Party newspaper People's Daily providing online computer technology information.\n\"I think the Chinese have made it clear that if you want to do business, then business becomes the business of government and that should be the priority,\" Dover said.\nSino-Australian relations, warm throughout the 13-year reign of the Australian Labour Party, started to chill once Howard's Liberal Party took over from Labour in elections in March 1996.\nThe relationship began to sour soon after the elections with the cancellation of a financial support scheme for Australian business in developing countries followed in September by a visit to Australia by Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.\nThe nadir came in August 1996 when China accused Australia of moving too close to the United States, after U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry described Japan and Australia as the northern and southern anchors of Washington's Asian security arrangements.\n\"From this we can see that the United States is really thinking about using these two 'anchors' as the claws of a crab,\" the official People's Daily said in an editorial.\nAustralia's trade commissioner in Shanghai, Richard Pillow, said he saw no impact from the political issues on Australia's booming trade with China -- Australian exports to China grew 24 percent in 1996 to A$3.896 billion ($3 billion).\n\"Howard's visit is a proactive move to strengthen bilateral ties,\" Pillow said, adding that Australian companies were on a long list of international firms wanting a slice of the Chinese pie.\nHoward arrives in Shanghai, China's biggest city and its mercantile heart, on Friday evening with a business delegation that includes representatives of Australian banks, insurance firms and commodity trading bodies.\nA number of deals expected to be announced during the trip, including the opening in Beijing of a branch of ANZ Bank, business sources said.\nIn the lead-up to his five-day China trip, Howard emphasised the importance of Canberra's relationship with Beijing and of Australia's place in Asia, and said the level of the business delegation with him reflected this.\n\"It is probably the most senior and most broadly based representative business group to accompany an Australian prime minister on an overseas trip,\" he said.\nIn 1996, Australia's imports from China were worth A$4.122 billion, up from A$3.861 billion the year before, Australian officials said.\n($1=A$0.78)\n", "The Florida judge in the Broin secondhand-smoke lawsuit on Thursday said he may undo the class-action status of the case, a move that would likely delay the start of a trial, scheduled for Monday.\nDade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye said during a hearing that even if tobacco companies were found liable by a jury for injuries caused by secondhand smoke, the claims of an estimated 60,000 plaintiffs might be too cumbersome for a single trial.  \nKaye said determining the direct linkage of secondhand smoke to individual ailments and setting the amounts due each of the non-smoking flight attendants covered by the Broin suit might be nearly impossible.\n\"I am very concerned about these issues,\" Kaye said.\nThe judge, who is also weighing a tobacco-industry request that fraud and conspiracy allegations be dropped from the suit, gave no indication when he might rule. Another pre-trial hearing was scheduled for Friday.  \nKaye five years ago knocked down the class-action status of the Broin case, first filed in 1991, but was overturned three years ago by a Florida appeals court, which ordered a trial after hearing tobacco company arguments the case was too cumbersome.\nIn a class-action suit, a few plaintiffs claim damages on behalf of a broader group with similar injuries. All share in damage payments, if there are any.  \nThe Broin case, named after American Airlines flight attendant Norma Broin, alleges that cigarette smoke aboard U.S. passenger jets caused the lung cancer and other ailments of thousands of non-smoking flight attendants. In-flight smoking in the United States was banned in 1988.\nIn court on Thursday, tobacco company lawyers asked Kaye to end the class-action status of the Broin suit and said each of the claims needed to be tried individually, since many factors beyond cigarette smoke may have caused the flight attendants' injuries.  \n\"This cannot proceed as a class action without dissolving into 60,000 individual trials,\" said Hugh Whiting, an attorney for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.\nSusan Rosenblatt, an attorney pressing the Broin case, said people with like injuries could be grouped for determining damages if the tobacco companies should be found liable in the first stage of the trial. Such sessions would be \"relatively simple,\" she said.  \nShe also said a financial settlement might be worked out with the tobacco companies if a jury should rule against them. \"They don't like to talk about that but it's a possibility,\" she said.\nTobacco companies have yet to pay a single dollar in damages, despite four decades of U.S. lawsuits, but they are now in secret talks with government officials that might end some of the court actions against the industry.  \nKaye asked Rosenblatt what would happen if he should end the class-action status of Broin. She said she and her co-counsel and husband, Stanley Rosenblatt, were not now prepared for such a late change.\n((--Miami newsroom, 305-374-5013))\n", "China and the United States made progress Thursday in talks on a new textile accord but negotiations could stretch late into the night on the last day before a deadline for agreement, a U.S. trade official said.\n\"We hope to complete the talks tonight,\" chief negotiator Rita Hayes said after talks Thursday morning with officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nProgress had been made on market access, she said. But the two sides still had a long way to go on the third day of talks to renew a 1994 textile accord and resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, she said.\nWashington could make significant cuts in China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the Jan. 31 deadline, Hayes said.\n\"We still have a lot of issues, so that means a lot of work today, probably late into the night,\" she said. \"We are not going to give China another extension because we have already given them another month.\"\nThe Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on Dec. 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.\nWashington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries. The United States has threatened multi-million dollar penalties and raised the specter of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue.\n\"I am always optimistic and I am in hopes that we will complete the round today ... but that is something both sides have to work very hard on,\" Hayes said.\nIf an agreement was not reached in time, past practice showed that the United States could cut China's textile import quota significantly until a deal was struck, she said.\n\"I am in hopes that it won't come to that. China doesn't want it to come to that -- and certainly the States doesn't,\" she said.\nIn Washington, acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday that the talks were proceeding fairly well.\nWashington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.\nChina has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.\nTextiles are just one of a range of issues dogging the Sino-U.S. relationship, which has long been strained by disputes over topics ranging from trade to human rights to Taiwan.\nA U.S. delegation arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for talks on human rights with Chinese officials, after a year in which almost all remaining members of the nation's tiny pro-democracy movement have been either imprisoned or driven into exile.\nU.S. trade official Lee Sands began talks in Beijing on Thursday to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of cross-Pacific friction.\nBeijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry.\nHayes said a key U.S. requirement was further opening of China's protected markets. \"What we are asking China for is upfront market access, before they join the WTO. We are still working out those differences.\"\n", "The Czech Republic appeared headed for its first budget deficit despite earlier reports by the fiscally-hawkish government that it had achieved a surplus for the fourth successive year.\n\"(We expect) the definitive results for 1996 will range around a deficit of 1.7 billion crowns,\" Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said on Wednesday in testimony to parliament's budget committtee.\nThe Czechs have had three surplus budgets since Czechoslovakia split in 1993.\nFinal data were due in the ministry on Wednesday but as local media paid close attention to whether monetarist Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus would maintain his fiscal winning streak, Havel said the trend was not positive.\nHe said that by Wednesday revenues totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.5 billion.\nMore bills may be delivered after the deadline, inflating expenditures further, Havel said.\nThe government made last-ditch efforts in December when the budget looked headed for a more than five billion crown deficit, by freezing some outlays until 1997, and requiring early repayment on credit granted to a deposit insurance fund.\nThe budget has been hampered by lower-than-expected tax revenue and delayed repayment on credits to Russia.\nThe 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of spending cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns.\nParliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome, but he was concerned with the effects government payment adjustments may have on the 1997 budget.\nPart of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which was due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s.\nKlaus, who calls balanced budgets the \"alpha and omega\" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus, made by the finance ministry soon after the new year, as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility.\nParliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.\nBut the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996.\nMany have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "Lloyd's of London announced on Tuesday it is to give Names more time to meet planned increases in the capital they must put up to support their underwriting activities.\nLloyd's has also dropped proposals to prevent Names - the traditional backers of the insurance market - using their own homes as collateral for underwriting.\nThe planned capital increases are part of a package of measures designed to strengthen the financial security that underpins Lloyd's and to provide a level playing field between Names and corporate members.\nThe longer transition period for the changes announced today may go some way to meeting the concerns of Names' representatives who had called for more time to be given to meet the new capital requirements.\nNames fear they are gradually being forced out of the market in favour of corporate capital first introduced in 1994, a charge repeatedly denied by the Lloyd's hierachy.\nNames are to be given three years before they have to meet the new requirements of showing evidence of assets amounting to 50 percent of the premiums they underwrite.\nIn a Lloyd's working party report last month a two-year transition period was proposed but, after consultations, that has been extended from 1999 to the year 2000.\nA phased increase in Names' minimum level of means to 350,000 pounds ($571,000) from the current level of 250,000 pounds has also been increased from two to five years and will come into force in 2002.\nThis 350,000 pounds will be made up of funds held at Lloyd's and evidence of \"other personal wealth\" (OPW).\nProposals to double the OPW requirements for 2000 and beyond have been dropped in favour of a slightly higher level of funds which must be held at Lloyd's.\nAt present Names must put up between 20 and 30 percent of the total business they back compared with 50 percent for corporate members.\nBy 2000, Names will have to hold 40 percent of premium capacity at Lloyd's with OPW making up a further 10 percent, bringing them into line with corporate members.\nThe use of \"principal private residences\" (PPRs) - Names' own homes - as collateral for members' underwriting are to be allowed to continue but only for those in existence at the end of 1994.\nNo new PPR backed guarantees may be introduced in the future nor existing one increased.\nRisk assessment is to be extended to all members from  1998 onward and may require higher capital levels for members with greater risk exposure.\nThis is expected to affect less than 10 percent of individual members.\nThe Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM), which represents Names' interests, broadly welcomed today's proposals, saying it was essential that all Names should demonstrate their ability to meet any losses they incurred.\nLloyd's proposals coincided with the publication of an independent report commissioned by the Market Interests Group - an alliance of the ALM, member agents and Lloyd's brokers.\nIt acknowledged that reform in particular of the annual venture and management of Names' based capital was important, but said that creating an environment that encouraged their disappearance would be a significant mistake.\nEarlier on Friday a leading figure in Lloyd's called for the capital structure of the market to be simplified.\nRobert Hiscox, chairman of insurance group Hiscox Plc described the annual venture - where syndicates are reformed anew every year - as an \"anachronistic absurdity\" and said the current mixture of unlimited and limited members was too expensive to maintain.

Morgan and Co. as its financial adviser and Republic National Bank of New York as its corporate adviser.\n\"This is the first step in finding a joint venture partner,\" a company spokesman said in an interview. \"We've hired J.P. Morgan and the Republic National Bank to evaluate our options.\"\nBre-X said it wants to find a big, experienced mining concern to buy 25 percent of the Busang gold property and help Bre-X to develop and market the deposit.\n\"Every major mining company in the world, quite literally, has expressed interest in working with us on Busang,\" said the spokesman.\n\"So pick the biggest mining companies in the world. If you want names, RTZ, Barrick, Placer Dome, all the way to some of the South African companies to Australian companies, you name it,\" he added.\nThe company said it hopes to have a deal sewn up by the end of the year and start production in late 1998 or 1999.\nThe global gold mining community has been holding its breath for months, waiting for Bre-X to open up bidding for its prized Busang deposit.\nThe choice of J.P. Morgan as an adviser \"reflects that this is going to be a large international process,\" Gordon Capital analyst Barry Allan said in an interview. \"Everyone is interested. The question is who can afford it.\"\nBuying a chunk of Bre-X will not be cheap. With the company's stock hovering around C$25 ($18.25), it has a market capitalisation of about C$5.9 billion ($4.3 billion) fully diluted.\nBre-X shares, which soared from from a penny stock to more than C$160 ($116) before a 10-for-one stock split last spring, is expected to climb higher, pushing up the price tag for a 25 percent stake in the deposit.\nThe decision on a financial adviser is only the first of a slew of announcements expected from Bre-X this month that could drive the stock.\nAn Indonesian government contract is expected within weeks, which will outline environmental, social, tax and financial obligations for Bre-X and its Indonesian partner.\nWhile details of the draft contract of work are already public, some observers fear the government may try to grab a bigger share of the profits as they see the deposit blossom.\nNew drilling results are also expected to hit the market within a couple of weeks, Bre-X said.\nBoth the contract of work and the drilling results will likely send the stock higher, analysts said.\nFor now, drilling at the Busang deposit has outlined 46.92 million ounces of gold. The next set of drill results should bump up the deposit to more than 50 million, analysts say.\n\"I've made the joke that everybody who goes to the property tends to see God,\" Gordon Capital analyst Allan said just days after returning from an analysts' trip to the site. \"And I guess I did. There's every probability it will be one of the largest in the world.\"\nThe mine should be low cost, especially in the first years, said Allan, with operating costs around US$150 an ounce.\nHe has set a target of $35 for the stock, in the middle of the C$30 to C$40 range set by most analysts after the most recent tour and a previous tour in July.\n\"I continue to be really impressed by the deposit,\" said analyst Chris Bradbrook at Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon, who has visited the site twice.  \"It keeps getting bigger and bigger. The upside is substantial.\"\nBradbrook has a C$30 target for the stock for now, since investors want to see who the company's partner will be and how the partner will develop the property before they bid up the stock. \"That is the biggest potential driver.\"\nBut Allan said Bre-X's options in developing the site include going it alone.\n\"They don't want to sell too low and give up some of the upside potential,\" he said. \"I'm sure they'll look at those offers and if they don't find any that are reasonable, I suspect they will go on their own.\"\nThe economics of the project are robust enough for Bre-X to finance the mine itself, he added.\nBre-X said it would consider that option too.\n", "The Australian government appointed stockbrokers on Thursday to manage the proposed sharemarket float of its telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp, which will be the nation's largest privatisation.\nThe float is estimated to raise a minimum of A$8.0 billion (US$6.32 billion) -- and perhaps much more.\nFinance Minister John Fahey said he wanted the Telstra float, through the sale of a third of the government's 100-percent stake, to go through by the end of the year.\n\"I want it ready to go to the market this year, this calendar year,\" Fahey told reporters.\n\"But I am not saying it will,\" he said. He added it was unclear whether the float of other international telephone companies would affect the float timing. France Telecom and Italy's state-owned Stet are also planned for sale this year.\nAustralian brokers J.B Were &amp; Son, U.S.-based CS First Boston and European based ABN AMRO/Rothschild had been appointed global co-ordinators for the float, Fahey said.\nHe said J.B Were, Ord Minnett of Australia,  CS First Boston, U.S.-Australian consortium Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank, Daiwa of Japan, ABN AMRO/Rothschild and German owned Deutsche Morgan Grenfell were appointed joint lead managers.\nThe float would not be underwritten in Australia, where 65 percent of the offer is to be sold. But the shares offered in the United States would be underwritten and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the minister said.\nTwo percent of the offer is set aside for Telstra employees and foreign investors are entitled to 35 percent.\nFahey would not comment on how much the government expects to raise from the partial sale of Telstra. \"I want to get optimum value for taxpayers of Australia,\" Fahey said.\nAustralia's Liberal-National Party coalition government was elected just over a year ago promsing to sell one-third of Telstra, with A$1.0 billion of the sale proceeds going to set up an environment fund.\nThe float of Telstra will far exceed other privatisations by the Australian government in recent years. The sale of Commonwealth Bank of Australia raised a total of A$8.0 billion, in two separate tranches, and the 1995 float of Qantas Airways Ltd raised A$1.45 billion.\nThe announcement was a boon to Australia's stockbroking community whose Christmas bonuses will be swelled by the Telstra float. The bidding for the Telstra deal was contested by 30 broking firms, which were invited to lodge proposals.\nHowever any of the appointed brokers for the managment of the Telstra float would be barred from managing the proposed float of rival telecom group Optus Communications Pty Ltd as it would be a conflict of interest, Fahey said.\n\"They will not be able to take part in other transactions which the Commonwealth (government) considers to be a conflict of interest and that includes taking part in a public offer of some other telecommunications group,\" Fahey said.\nOptus plans a share market float later this year, but the float is held up by court action.\n(A$1 =US$.79)\n", "Hong Kong yachtsmen bent with the wind on Thursday, voting overwhelmingly to adopt a Chinese name, two weeks before the territory's return to Chinese rule on July 1.\nWhile keeping the name \"Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club\" in English, members of the elite colonial sporting club voted in a show of hands to adopt a Chinese name, which when translated would simply mean \"Hong Kong Yacht Club\".\nAt an extraordinary general meeting called to decide on the Chinese name, club commodore David Kong admitted to more than 200 members that the Chinese name was a compromise.\nThe club, which to this day has fewer ethnic Chinese members than Westerners, was deeply divided last year when its mostly British members fought hard to keep the \"Royal\" tag on the English name.\nChinese members lobbied hard but failed twice to remove the \"Royal\" tag, a symbol of British colonialism that they felt would be inappropriate after Hong Kong reverts to China.\n\"The proposal we have in front of us is a compromise. We are being courteous and considerate to the incoming government and courteous and considerate to our members,\" Kong told members.\nStill, about seven members at the meeting voted nay.\n\"What is this?

Both Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom have said they are interested.\nTMM last week posted a 1996 net attributable loss of 3.1 billion francs, which included hefty provisions for factory closures and the expected loss of up to 10,000 jobs.\nBut it expects to break even at the operating level next year and be profitable from 1999 when U.S. patent revenues come on stream.\nThomson-CSF announced last week it returned to profit in 1996 after three years of losses, showing a net attributable profit of 745 million francs.\n", "China and the United States signed a new textile agreement on Sunday in an eleventh-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and was hailed by both sides as a breakthrough.\nU.S. officials said their main achievement was gaining assured access for the first time to Chinese textile markets, adding that it also granted China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact.\nMillions of dollars in penalties slapped by Washington on Chinese imports remained in force under the deal, although Beijing had agreed to withdraw its threat of retaliation, top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said after the signing.\n\"For the first time the United States has market access with China...and this is something we felt very strongly about,\" Hayes told reporters. \"It is now a situation that we have a level playing field.\"\nThe four-year textile accord was signed by Hayes and Li Dongsheng, China's chief negotiator and director of the trade management department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nOfficials of both sides welcomed the deal, which was hammered out during negotiations that ran far beyond their original three-day schedule to become a gruelling six-day marathon topped by all-night sessions.\n\"After six days of hard work, the delegations have reached a rather ideal conclusion,\" said Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, who attended the signing ceremony.\nOfficials of both sides declined to give details of the accord, but Hayes said it would create U.S. jobs by allowing exports while slightly increasing China's U.S. import quota.\nThe talks focused on renewal of the 1994 textile accord and resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, with market access for U.S. goods to China also a major stumbling block, officials said.\nBreakthrough came during a one-day extension to the final deadline for renewal of the Sino-U.S. accord, which had originally been scheduled to expire on Dec. 31 but was extended by one month to allow time to reach a compromise.\n\"I think this morning at the beginning we were unhappy with each other, but now we have become friends,\" U.S. negotiator Li told Hayes during the signing of the accord.\nThe accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.\nChina had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but delayed the action to allow time for further talks.\nAfter the signing of the textile accord, Beijing announced it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but U.S. negotiator Hayes said Washington's penalties remained in force.\n\"The transshipment charges that were made in September still stand as they did,\" she said without elaborating.\nAccess to China's huge and growing markets was also an issue in other Sino-U.S. meetings in Beijing last week.\nU.S. trade official Lee Sands held two days of talks in the Chinese capital to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of bilateral friction.\n\"The agreement is once again proof that China and the United States can settle their trade disputes through negotiations based on equality and mutual benefits,\" said negotiator Li.\n", "Apple Computer Inc. said Friday it will cut 4,100 jobs, or nearly a third of its work force, and discontinue its consumer computer line in a bid to slash costs and return to profits.\nThe restructuring, the second in a year, will cost Apple a total of $250 million in charges to earnings for the next three quarters, the company said.\nMeanwhile, Apple expects revenue for its fiscal second quarter, ending March, to plunge 22 percent to about $1.6 billion because of weak Macintosh sales.\nApple said it plans to drop its Macintosh Performa PCs, the models geared toward home users, to concentrate on its more profitable Power Macintosh line.\n\"It's very painful to have to lay off people who have worked so hard during the past year in trying to bring Apple back to health,\" Chairman Gilbert Amelio said. But Apple needs to cut $500 million in annual costs just to break even this year, he said.\nApple was bold to cut so many jobs and to discontinue one of its key brands, analysts said. But the company still does not have a clear plan to get sales going again.\n\"The company is on the aggressive side on reducing costs,\" said Walter Winnitzki, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York. \"But the issue for me is, can Apple reignite its sales momentum?\"\nHampering Apple's efforts to reignite sales, the company also said it will not ship a long-awaited revamped operating system  -- the software that controls the basic functions of its PCs -- until at least June 1998, about six months later than the company had previously said.\nInvestors and Apple customers have been counting on the new operating system, code-named \"Rhapsody,\" to give Apple's computers a clear technological lead over PCs using technology from Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker will keep customers away from the Mac isle at computer stores, analysts said.\nThe job cuts include 2,700 full-time employees and 1,400 contract workers. Apple plans to give employees 60-day notices later this month. Before the layoffs, Apple employed about 13,400 including contract workers.\nIn the fiscal second quarter ending March 31, Apple will take a $155 million charge against earnings to cover the cost of the layoffs. The company also plans to take another $322.5 million charge for the December acquisition of Next Software Inc.\nFred Anderson, Apple's finance chief, declined to say what the company's total loss in the second quarter will be, but analysts said their preliminary estimates are close to $1 billion.\nWith the cost cuts, Apple could return to profit by the fiscal fourth quarter ending September, Anderson said.\nApple, which invented the first user-friendly computer, has suffered in recent years from missed opportunities, management turmoil and failed products.\nAmelio, who took over in early 1996, has been refocusing Apple's effort on its healthiest businesses. As part of the restructuring, Apple will drop development of software based on the so-called OpenDoc technology and computer servers based on International Business Machines Corp.'s AIX standard. Apple also will stop development of its video-conferencing products.\nThe company will keep its Newton handheld computer for now, Apple said. The Newton was expected to be discontinued or sold to another company as part of Friday's restructuring.\nAmelio has been under increasing pressure from shareholders and loyal customers to come up with new products to get sales going again.\nOn Friday, he dismissed calls for him to step down.\n\"Why would I step aside when we are at the cusp of turning this around?\" he told reporters.\n", "Talks about Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc joining a grand telecoms alliance spanning the United States, France and Germany highlights the urgency with which companies are jostling to plug gaps in their global reach.\nFrance Telecom said on Wednesday it was in talks with the British group about C&amp;W joining Global One, one of three main world partnerships racing to offer lucrative communications services to multinational firms.\n\"There are talks with Cable and Wireless and they centre on whether the company can become the British partner for Global One,\" chairman Michel Bon said.\nThe disclosure was spurred by a report that Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc was mulling a potential $15 billion bid for America's Sprint Corp that was quickly knocked down by Sprint and its partner France Telecom.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that C&amp;W had held talks with France Telecom, which along with Deutsche Telekom AG owns 10 percent of Sprint, about supporting a bid.\nSprint noted that a hostile takeover by Cable and Wireless and France Telecom was impossible because of standstill agreements with its European partners under which their stakes in the U.S. group cannot be increased without its permission.\nAnalysts have been tipping a closer alliance between the two groups for months, although most believe a link-up will be sealed by Global One taking a stake in C&amp;W's cable venture, Cable and Wireless Communications.\nU.S. telecoms giant AT &amp; T Corp has formed a loosely-knit alliance called Unisource/World Partners, and British Telecommunications Plc has formed Concert Plc with its U.S. partner MCI Communications Corp .\nA record merger and acquisition boom has been predicted in the $800 billion world telecoms industry, spurred by tumbling trade barriers as the domestic revenues of telecoms firms are squeezed by increasingly tough competition.\nAnalysts predict that world trade liberalisation, spurred by international treaties, will lead to the formation of mega-carriers that will try to capture the entire traffic of multinational firms with offices in the U.S., Europe and the Far East.\nA deal between Concert and Spain's Telefonica  to create a formidable telephone network spanning the Americas may be announced this week, industry sources said on Wednesday.\nAmerica and Britain, which have led the liberalisation of world telecom markets, are setting the pace for mergers.\nIn the last 12 months, mergers have run to tens of billions of dollars as carriers such as MFS WorldCom , BT and MCI, Bell Atlantic and NYNEX and SBC and Pacific Telesis announced merger plans.\nBut the big mergers are also starting to show the strain of coordinating global management.\nSome analysts warn that although C&amp;W, with its attractive asset bases in Britain and Asia, is probably one of the most sought-after telecom partners, it is not a \"natural bedfellow\" with France Telecom.\n\"Commercially speaking, there's a huge amount of tension within Global One,\" said Paul Staples, head of the telecoms team at merchant bank Schroders.\nStaples thinks only the political will of the French and German governments is keeping Global One together in its current form.\n\"I'm in the camp that says I'd be surprised if Global One was in its current form in two years time,\" he said.\nThe group has not resolved the issue of what to do in markets outside France, Germany or the U.S. and are often bumping up against each other in Asia Pacific, pursuing potentially conflicting investment strategies.\nUnlike BT and MCI's Concert alliance that aims to offer seamless services to corporate customers, Global One's partners do not see their alliance as an investment vehicle to extend coverage, he noted.\n\"They see it as a standardised marketing agreement,\" he said.\nFrance Telecom is also embroiled in a partial privatisation at home and needs a period of stability before embarking on big, new ventures.\n\"The market will not tolerate France Telecom senior management going off on a frolic of their own,\" Staples said.\nInstitutions are looking for the company to concentrate first on its domestic customers and running an efficient business, he said.\n($ = 0.628 British Pounds)\n", "On a stage full of Hong Kong popstars, a middle-aged woman, cracking jokes, stole the show on Tuesday as Hong Kong's future first lady and a song-writer.\nThis was a kind of solo debut for Betty Tung who has written the lyrics of a song the world will hear when Hong Kong rejoins China on July 1.\nTill now she has been overshadowed by her husband, prospective leader Tung Chee-hwa, an ex-shipping tycoon still wary of the public spotlight.\nAccompanied by photographers' popping flashlights and questioning journalists, she walked into a studio and beamed widely, taking it all in her stride.\nTung Chee-hwa and Betty will be Hong Kong's leading couple from midnight June 30 when Britain hands the territory to China and governor Chris Patten and his wife Lavender sail away.\nElegantly dressed in a blue navy suit with a scarf, Betty took to the stage with half a dozen popular music stars to announce a musical gala on July 1, first day of Chinese rule.\nFeaturing in the \"Hong Kong Medley\" during the gala show is a song, \"The Homecoming\", in which Betty stars as lyricist.\n\"I don't know who you've come to see, but I've come to see my idols,\" Betty told reporters as she posed next to heartthrobs of the local popular music scene -- Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, George Lam and Sally Yeh -- who will all belt out the medley on July 1.\nLittle known in the past to the Hong Kong public, Tung and his wife were thrown into media glare when he was selected in December to become the territory's first post-handover leader.\nBut Betty seems to have taken on her demanding public role with consummate ease, perhaps even more so than her husband.\n\"Do I not look good to you?\" she shot out to one reporter when asked how well she and her husband were taking to their new public roles, before promptly taking the next question.\nAnnouncers at the packed news conference said Betty provided inspiration for the \"The Homecoming\" and wrote the lyrics.\nBut the first lady-to-be sought to play down the accolade.\n\"I do not know musical notes, I just felt the song was so good to my ear and I was very much encouraged to do a bit of thinking,\" she told reporters.\n\"But I really didn't contribute very much to the song, I really must pass the microphone to my colleagues who did most of the work,\" she said.\nHer husband, meanwhile, will be surprised.\n\"Mr Tung doesn't know I'm here. I think I've told him that there is a song. His staff has heard it.\"\n\"But he's so very busy with the handover, I hope he will be very pleasantly surprised,\" Betty said.\n", "Morgan Stanley's surprise merger with Dean Witter Discover will create a more competitive force in the European investment banking market.\n\"Other banks will look at this and think they have got a stronger competitor than they had before,\" a banking analyst at one European firm told Reuters on Wednesday.\nEarlier the two U.S. firms said they had agreed to form a financial giant called Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co, with a market capitalisation of $21 billion.\nBoth U.S. and European investment banks have been pushing for more business in continental Europe and Britain, but analysts pointed out the merger would give Morgan Stanley's European aspirations considerable backing.\nNot only would it increase the amount of capital at the firm's disposal for building its European presence, Dean Witter's U.S. retail network could also provide an additional distribution network for Morgan Stanley products.\nThe firms stressed there would be little overlap as a result of the merger, although they did not specify if there would be any staff cuts. A Morgan Stanley spokesman in London said he could not comment on the implications for the firm in Europe.\nA Dean Witter official said it was still early days. \"We've only just seen the news. It was kept extremely quiet,\" Graham Elliot, sales manager at Dean Witter International told Reuters.\nElliot said Dean Witter employs about 120 people in London, with around 35 working in institutional equities sales. This business was, he said, consistently profitable and had been expanding. \"We talk to over 300 institutions,\" he said.\nThe firm already has significant placing power and its European business is extremely focused, he added.\nDean Witter, founded in 1924, has a presence on London futures and options exchange LIFFE, but it was not immediately clear how its operations there would be merged.\nIn Eurobonds, there will be no immediately obvious gains to Morgan Stanley. It has led 16 international bond issues deals worth $2.5 billion this year, putting it in 14th place in the league table compiled by Capital DATA Bondware.\nDean Witter is not active in the Eurobond market, while in 1996 Morgan Stanley ranked fifth in the league table.\nBanking sources said the merger would be largely complementary in London, adding that the firms would have to search fairly hard to find room for cutting staff.\n\"But they don't usually look to take people on in this sort of situation,\" one said.\nMorgan Stanley, founded in 1935, employs around 2,000 people in its Canary Wharf headquarters in the docklands area in east London and has just over 2,500 employees in Europe as a whole. Dean Witter's London offices are in the Broadgate development to the north of London's financial heartland.\nSome said there could be a fall-out of key personnel if there was a significant change in corporate culture or a management restructuring of the European operation.\nBut the idea of a merger is not new to Morgan Stanley, which in 1994 engaged in unsuccessful talks with British merchant bank S.G. Warburg. Warburgs was later bought by Swiss Bank Corp.\nA joint statement by Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter detailed the new senior management structure but gave no indication of the position of Morgan Stanley's executive chairman in Europe Sir David Walker or other senior European personnel.\nMorgan Stanley insiders in London said the first they had heard of the merger was an address by Richard Fisher, the firm's chairman, over the internal communications system.\n", "Aerospace company Hughes Electronics Corp heads the list of bidders to buy satellite services provider PanAmSat Corp with a strong offer, a source close to the talks said on Friday.\n\"I think they are just looking at the best offers on the table now,\" the source told Reuters, adding that Hughes' offer was currently about the best on the table.\nBoth PanAmSat and Hughes declined to comment on what they called speculative reports. Hughes is part of General Motors Corp.  \nHowever, Hughes chief executive Mike Armstrong told Reuters on Wednesday that the company was considering a multi-billion dollar acquisition in aerospace and defense.\n\"We are always looking at ventures that will make our business grow\" said Hughes spokeswoman Marcy Garber.\nAnalysts say PanAmSat could be worth $3.5 billion or more, a substantial premium over the $2.75 billion market capitalization of the company. The stock was trading at 27-3/8, up 3/8 late on Friday morning.  \nThe source, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said that talks are continuing, but no deal is imminent. He would not say how much Hughes was offering.\nPanAmSat's majority owners are Grupo Televisa SA of Mexico and the family of founder Rene Anselmo, which each own 40.5 percent of the company's 100 million shares. The rest are publicly traded.\n\"Rene Anselmo did a great job and took a lot of risks, and now his benefactors are going to reap the rewards,\" said analyst Jimmy Schaeffler of the Carmel Group.  \nIn April Televisa and the Anselmo family asked investment bankers Morgan Stanley to find a takeover or joint venture partner for the company, or to plan a secondary stock issue.\nThe source said that Televisa preferred a sale option, though the Anselmo family had no preference.\nOther rumored bidders include Lockheed Martin Corp, General Electric Co Loral Space &amp; Communications Ltd, and Deutsche Telekom of Germany according to press reports.\nPanAmSat has a unique franchise as the only global competitor to Intelsat, which is owned by numerous governments and was set up under a treaty.\nPanAmSat's customers include a vast array of international broadcasters from Time Warner Inc to News Corp, the British Broadcasting Corp and China Central TV.\nSchaeffler said its expansion plans put it in a powerful position for new services and covering new areas like Africa and the central Asian republics which so far have no western satellite coverage. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1712\n", "The French government on Wednesday called off a controversial sale of the state electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe but President Jacques Chirac vowed to bring the sell-off to fruition.\nThe government, which had doggedly defended its choice amid a storm of employee protest and political opposition, made the U-turn after the independent Privatisation Commission challenged the terms of a South Korean firm's involvement in the sale.\n\"The French defence electronics industry can lay claim to being world class,\" Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said. \"The privatisation of Thomson is key to creating the necessary 'poles of excellence' needed to achieve this ambition.\"\n\"The government will carry (the sale) out in accordance with the terms set on February 22,\" she said, referring to Chirac's televised speech on restructuring the army and defence industry.\nFinance Minister Jean Arthuis told reporters the process would be delayed by several weeks, but other politicians said it could stall things for months.\n\"Unfortunately, the decision to suspend the privatisation process to which the government has had to resort will delay this process by serveral months, possibly even a year,\" said, Francois-Michel Gonnot, a parliamentary committee chairman and member of the ruling coalition.\nLagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58-percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its Matra Defense Espace unit and sell television set and video recorder maker Thomson Multimedia to Korea's Daewoo Electronics.\nThe Privatisation Commission, France's highest authority on the sale of state assets, said in a confidential report obtained by Reuters that the Daewoo deal did not fully reflect the value of Thomson's technology in digital decoders and flat screens.\nThe decision to suspend the sale of loss-making Thomson SA was the second embarassing U-turn on a privatisation in two weeks after a decision to suspend the sale of state-owned bank CIC following staff protests and political opposition.\nSeveral thousand workers of Thomson Multimedia marched in Paris and other cities on November 20 to protest against a sale to a booming Asian competitor, fearing for their jobs and working conditions.\nThe government said in mid-October it had picked Lagardere over rival bidder Alcatel Alsthom because it was best for French defence interests and that it would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc after a 10.8 billion franc ($2 billion) state capital injection.\nLagardere shares closed 6.4 percent down at 146.00 francs in Paris after having been suspended in the morning, because investors believed the Thomson deal was good for the company.\nAlcatel Alsthom dropped three percent to 460.70 francs because it is now back in the race.\nOpposition parties said on Wednesday that they hoped the delay would lead to the total scrapping of the sale plan.\n\"Today is a first success...but we should not stop there,\" Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande said.\n\"We are now calling for the privatisation to be abandoned totally,\" he said. Communist Party members said they now wanted a national debate on the future of Thomson.\nThe ruling RPR party said in a statement Hollande was behaving like a \"shipwrecked man who blames his rescuers for his problems in getting afloat.\"\n", "Rubbermaid Inc, hurt badly by skyrocketing costs of raw materials used to make key products, is hoping to limit its dependence on plastic with the acquisition of Graco Children's Products Inc.\nThe move to diversify its raw material base is critical for Rubbermaid, which earlier said third quarter earnings will fall short of expectations due to rising prices for resins.\n\"They are so reliant on this one raw material and its been obvious that resin costs have been going against them,\" said Eric Bosshard of Midwest Rsearch-Maxus Group.  \nRubbermaid sought to soften the bad earnings news by announcing plans to buy privately held Graco for $320 million in cash. Graco products, which include strollers and high chairs, are made of textiles and metals, as well as plastic.\nBut Rubbermaid shares extended morning losses in afternoon trade, tumbling 4 to 22-1/2 on fears it will feel the impact of the rising raw material costs beyond the third quarter.\nThe Wooster, Ohio-based company said third quarter sales and earnings will be flat with year-ago levels. Analysts had expected both sales and earnings to rise.  \nThe Graco acquisition also will extend Rubbermaid's move into juvenile products. It already is positioned in that market through its Little Tikes division, which makes plastic toys.\n\"We plan to grow and expand Graco. It will not be folded into Little Tikes,\" said Rubbermaid spokeswoman Lorrie Crum.\nLike other divisions of Rubbermaid, Little Tikes is experiencing a disappointing third quarter. In addition to the higher raw material costs, Crum attributed weaker sales to competition from industry player Fisher-Price, which is owned by Mattel Inc.  \nCrum also cited unusual summer weather in much of the U.S., which kept retail inventories high.\nBut the rising resin prices are considered the main issue Rubbermaid must combat in coming months even as the company moves forward with a restructuring announced last December. Strong demand for resins, combined with some supply problems, have triggered several price hikes and another is slated to take effect in October.\n\"We are looking at a number of options before us that can be done to address the resin situation,\" Crum said, adding that market prices have risen from about 32 cents per pound in April to 47 cents.\nShe did not elaborate on those options.\nBut analysts are not expecting the company to accelerate its restructuring, which already calls for intensive cost-cutting.\n\"I don't think there's any slash-and-burn strategy at this point,\" said one analyst who did not want to be identified.\n", "Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) said its new SuperTerminal 1 will be only 50 percent operational when Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok(CLK) airport is due to open in April 1998.\nHACTL managing director Anthony Charter told reporters during a construction site visit to the facility -- now about 25 percent complete -- that meeting the Airport Authority's opening deadline date was causing major concerns.\nThe new cargo terminal is due to cost HK$7.8 billion and is planned to be the world's biggest air cargo facility.\n\"It's a tall order when you see the size of the building. We will have something ready in April 1998, although we are not contractually due to open until August. The builders are working under severe pressure and we are doing our best but whether we will be able to cope in April, I cannot say,\" Charter said.\n\"If the airport opens in April we will have 50 percent of capacity available but 75 percent from June 30,\" Charter said.\nSuperTerminal 1 is expected to be able to handle 1.2 million tonnes a year from June 1998 which is less than the 1.5 million tonnes Kai Tak handles now and does not take into account growth rates. A second, smaller cargo terminal is also being built.\nIndustry sources said it is vital that the cargo complex, one of the most technologically advanced of its kind, works perfectly on opening to prevent a logistical nightmare and an enormous traffic jam at the HK$49.8 billion new airport.\nIt is currently planned to close Kai Tak and open the new airport the following morning but Charter said he would like to see a \"soft\" opening to ensure a smooth start.\nThat could mean some cargo aircraft using the new airport during the night to test the highly automated cargo handling systems.\nHe also raised the possibility of Kai Tak remaining open while CLK gradually built up. A 24 hour embargo on cargo being delivered to the new facility might also have to be imposed, he added.\nThere had also been a two month delay to an already very tight schedule because of problems with concrete form work by the main contractor, Charter said.\nAn industry source told Reuters that the infamous baggage handling delays suffered by Denver's new airport showed how vital it was that everything work before opening.\nHe said it was rare for a new airport to open on time and increasing financial and political pressure was being put on contractors to ensure the opening deadline for CLK was met.\n- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017\n", "The number of bankruptcies in China soared by more than 160 percent in 1996 to exceed the total of the previous seven years but experts on Tuesday warned that many more insolvent firms waited in the wings.\n\"This is a startling figure,\" bankruptcy expert Cao Siyuan said in a telephone interview.\nA total of 6,232 firms declared bankruptcy in China last year, an increase of 161.3 percent compared with 1995 when 2,385 companies went under, said Cao, architect of China's existing bankruptcy law and who now runs his own consultancy business.\nThe 1996 figure compared with the total of 5,395 firms that went bankrupt from 1989 to 1995, said Cao.\nHe attributed the sharp rise in the number of bankruptcies to the progress of China's market-oriented reforms launched in 1978 by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to replace Stalinist-style central planning with a sink-or-swim system.\n\"Many of the firms that went bankrupt last year were already effectively bankrupt but had delayed their final procedures or announcement,\" Cao said. \"It was a situation where they had no choice but to declare bankruptcy.\"\nHe estimated the number of bankruptcies this year could soar as China pushed ahead with reforms to force its thousands of loss-making state enterprises to turn a profit or go under.\n\"Bankruptcies could exceed 10,000 this year if the government doesn't interfere,\" Cao said.\nBankruptcy has long been controversial in China even after the bankruptcy law was passed in 1988 and the law has generally been used only to liquidate smaller enterprises because of fears of mass unemployment and unrest.\nBankruptcies would increase dramatically if all firms that actually were no longer viable were allowed to go under, Cao said.\nThe current rate of bankruptcies was about 0.06 percent of China's estimated 10 million companies, including private and collective firms as well as the 100,000 strong state sector.\n\"I think a level of 1.0 percent would be more reasonable,\" Cao said, dismissing fears among some sectors of the government that the level of bankruptcies was too high.\nBeijing's communist rulers have been trying to promote the use of mergers rather than bankruptcies to liquidate firms that have no hope of getting out of the red.\nMergers far exceeded bankruptcies, but no specific numbers were available, Cao said.\nOnly a tiny number of China's bankruptcies were a result of a decision by banks to foreclose, Cao said, adding that this phenomenon needed attention.\nOf the 2,385 bankruptcies in 1995, only 47, or two percent, were a result of applications from the banks, while in 1996 the number was just 72, or just 1.2 percent of the total, Cao said.\nOne reason for the reluctance of banks to foreclose was because many branches had extended loans to enterprises without following the correct procedures, he said, adding that managers were afraid of possible repercussions if the level of bad debt became public knowledge.\nOfficials have said state commercial banks would write off 30 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) in bad debts of state enterprises in 1997, up from 20 billion yuan in 1996.\nMany of the bankruptcies last year were in China's fast-developing coastal provinces where reforms had made greater progress, Cao said.\nFar fewer were reported in booming southern Guangdong province were firms were more reluctant to admit defeat or in the capital, Beijing, where officials feared bankruptcies would result in layoffs and possible social unrest, he said.\n", "Paccar Inc., maker of Kenworth, Peterbilt and Foden heavy-duty trucks, reported fourth-quarter profits well above expectations Tuesday as it benefited from its acquisition of Dutch-based DAF Trucks N.V.\nPaccar earnings slid to $62.5 million, or $1.61 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $65.1 million, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier. Sales edged up to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion.\nBut the earnings were well above average Wall Street expectations of $1.23 a share, according to First Call, and Paccar stock rose $2.25 to $69.75 in afternoon Nasdaq trading.\n\"It was quite a nice quarter for them,\" said analyst Paul Latta of brokerage Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. He credited the better-than-expected results to the acquisition of DAF, completed in November for $543.8 million.\n\"Everybody knew it would be accretive (help earnings) and was wondering how accretive it would be,\" he said. \"It looks like it's falling into the category of very accretive.\"\nThe Bellevue, Wash.-based company did not break out European business, but Latta and others said Paccar's truck-making operations performed substantially better than expected in the quarter.\n\"Last year was a strong year for heavy-duty truck manufacturing -- much better, in fact, than many in the industry anticipated,\" said Paccar Chairman Mark Pigott. \"Paccar increased its market share (of the largest trucks) as more trucking companies specified our products.\"\nFor the year, Paccar net income fell to $201 million, or $5.17 per share, from $252.8 million, or $6.50 per share, in 1995. Sales dropped to $4.3 billion from $4.6 billion.\nPigott said analysts expected 1997 to be a reasonable year for truck manufacturers despite softer markets in both North America and Europe.\nAnalysts agreed, noting that markets had held up better than expected despite concerns about overcapacity in the U.S. truck fleet.\n\"I think the one thing that has been surprising to everyone in the industry is that truck demand has not slowed as much as had been forecast,\" said John Rogers of Jensen Securities.\nHe noted that U.S. truck sales volume was down about 15 percent last year, compared with estimates of up to a 25 percent decline.\nRichard Walles of DRI/McGraw Hill in London estimated total U.S. truck sales would decline less than 10 percent this year while European sales would remain flat.\nTruck fleet operators are at the tail end of a replacement cycle, but sales remain at historically high levels, \"so we can't complain too much,\" he said.\nPaccar said operating profits surged 28 percent last year in its financial services sector due to a growing portfolio and significantly lower credit loss provisions in Mexico.\n", "Former U.S. president George Bush called on Thursday for an end to U.S. trade threats against China, saying more dialogue was needed between Washington and Beijing to mend cross-Pacific ties.\nThe United States should give China permanent Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status to end the annual diplomatic battle over its renewal, Bush said in a speech at a seminar in Beijing.\n\"I am very concerned about the rancour that sometimes rears its head these days,\" he said. \"There is too much China-bashing in the United States of America.\"\nSome members of the U.S. Congress had little understanding of China and how to deal with Beijing, Bush said.\n\"Threatening China does not work,\" he said. \"It might be good domestic politics in some quarters of the United States, but it does not bring about change, and it ought to stop.\"\nRelations between Washington and Beijing have been badly strained this year by disputes over trade, copyright theft, nuclear proliferation and Taiwan.\nWashington needs a strategic dialogue with Beijing to iron out differences before they become major disputes and to help stabilise a bilateral relationship that was of unsurpassed importance, Bush said.\n\"We can start by granting permanent, unconditional MFN for China,\" he told the Chinese and U.S. businessmen and officials in a speech salted with nostalgic references to his experiences as a diplomat in Beijing during the 1970s.\nMFN give favourable tariff treatment to Chinese goods imported into the U.S.\nSino-U.S. ties chilled in March when Chinese missile tests off the coast of rival Taiwan led Washigton to send two aircraft carrier battle groups into the area in a show of force.\nIn June, the two sides narrowly averted a multi-billion dollar trade war over intellectual property theft in China, while alleged sales of Chinese nuclear technology to Pakistan and Beijing's fat U.S. trade surplus have also strained ties.\nBoth sides say relations have warmed in the last few months but Bush said more was needed, advising Beijing to value the contribution of U.S. businessmen in China -- a group that has long campaigned for better ties and permanent MFN.\n\"American business is China's best ally in reducing the misunderstanding and suspicions that cloud our relationship from time to time,\" Bush said.\n", "Convicts leading a riot, in which at least five guards died, demanded on Friday to be flown out of a jail in northern Colombia by helicopter to an undisclosed location, the regional human rights ombudsman said.\nThe inmates, some convicted leftist guerrillas and others former police officers, requested 10 parachutes, while one man, a jailed leader of the now defunct M-19 rebel group, demanded political exile in Cuba, ombudsman Carmen Quintero said.\nAbout 550 prisoners seized control of the jail compound in Valledupar, in Cesar province, after taking weapons from prison guards on Thursday evening.\nA National Prison Institute (INPEC) spokeswoman said the prisoners had taken 16 hostages, including the jail's deputy director and a 14-year-old girl.\n\"The prisoners are demanding vehicles to leave the jail and two helicopters with 10 parachutes. They have not said where they want to fly to but said they would take the hostages with them as a guarantee,\" Quintero told reporters outside the jail.\nProvincial governor Mauricio Pimiento, part of the delegation trying to mediate the crisis, said he would not discuss the inmates' demands until they had freed their hostages and allowed all the dead and injured to be removed from the compound.\n\"A prisoner has reported that five guards are dead...,\" a spokeswoman for the prison said.\nThe inmates allowed an ambulance into the prison for some of the five inmates and jail guards injured in the initial shootout.\nPolice and soldiers surrounded the prison and fired bullets and tear gas over the walls but were ordered not to enter for fear of inflaming the situation, the spokeswoman said.\n\"We are holding our fire and have merely formed three security cordons around the jail,\" a police spokesman later told Reuters by phone from Valledupar.\nCol. Rafael Pardo, head of national prisons, said there was no independent confirmation of the number of dead and injured because inmates had barred the security forces from entering the jail.\nIn addition to the small group of prisoners looking to break out of the jail, other inmates are demanding an end to prison overcrowding and improved living conditions.\nThe Valledupar prison is designed to house 200 convicts but more than 550 are imprisoned there. Earlier this week, Justice Minister Carlos Medellin admitted chronic overcrowding had turned Colombia's jails into a \"seedbed for corruption and violence.\"\nAcross Colombia, 40,000 inmates are housed in facilities designed for 30,000 prisoners.\nIf news of the deaths was confirmed, it would be the worst in a string of prison disturbances this year. Last week, more than 2,000 inmates, led by leftist guerrillas, rioted and started fires in Bogota's La Modelo jail in protest at prison overcrowding.\nAnother convict died in the top-security wing of Bogota's La Picota jail when a bomb he was making in his cell exploded. Prisoners have rioted in at least three provincial jails so far this year.\n", "Toronto stocks ended mixed in brisk dealings on Friday, amid nervousness over a possible U.S. interest rate hike and quarterly triple-witching.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 19.50 points to close at 6074.78 on turnover of 101.5 million shares worth C$1.9 billion ($1.38 billion).\nBut the overall market was mixed with declining issues outnumbering advances 491 to 447, while 331 stocks were unchanged.\nVolatility earlier in the session was due partly to the quarterly expiry of options, futures and options on futures called triple-witching, traders said.\nInvestors are also nervously awaiting a possible rise in U.S. interest rates following the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday.\n\"We have the anticipation of (U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan doing what he said he was going to do,\" said Montreal-based strategist Bill Ram.\nThe TSE, Canada's largest stock market, lost 87 points this week from last Friday's close.\nOf Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 10 moved higher led by banks, oils, forestry products and conglomerates.

Analysts said recent financial problems among wireless carriers will put downward pressure on prices. It is the Federal Communication Commission's 14th airwave sale.\n\"I expect prices to go very low for this type of spectrum,\" said Elliott Hamilton, analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm.\nThe FCC is auctioning 128 licenses. Of that total, 104 are 10 megahertz licenses that roughly cover state-wide areas. The remaining 24 permits are for 5 MHz of spectrum and cover larger regional areas.\nThe FCC is not dictating what services companies can offer over this portion of the spectrum.\nPotential applications include broadband wireless access to the Internet, wireless local phone networks, and location services for pinpointing trucks and other vehicles.\nThe value of wireless spectrum has fallen after last year's $10.2 billion auction of licenses for a new generation of cellular phones known as \"personal communications services,\" or PCS.\nEdward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine, said FCC officials \"should be ecstatic\" if the agency can net $2 billion from the lastest auction.\nSeveral top bidders at the PCS sale are under financial strain after bidding high prices. Wall Street has been reluctant to invest in the ventures.\nAlso, FCC officials doubt wireless service providers can offer anytime soon the kind of mobile phone service available through PCS.\nFCC officials cite restrictions on the use of the wireless service airwaves that are meant to prevent interference among users of an upcoming digital radio service that will be broadcast coast-to-coast via satellite. The wireless service and digital radio airwaves are adjacent to one another.\nThe FCC has raised some $23 billion through its airwave sales. But the financial problems among last year's PCS winners has raised doubts over whether the government will ever collect all the money it is owed.\n", "Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday profits jumped 82 percent to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as it rebounded from product launches that held profits down a year earlier.\nFord, the last of the Big Three Detroit automakers to report fourth-quarter results, said the earnings equaled $1 a share. The results reflected a total of $132 million in special charges, including costs related to Ford's decision to cut 3,500 jobs last year.\nIn the 1995 quarter, Ford earned $660 million, or 49 cents a share. Sales rose to $38.8 billion from $34.6 billion.\nExcluding one-time items, Ford's fourth quarter income was $1.10 a share -- higher than the $1.02 a share forecast by analysts, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.\nAlthough Ford appears to be making headway in cost reduction, analysts were not overly impressed, noting that sales of high-profit light truck products are booming.\n\"They were not great, especially in view of the fact that they are selling a lot trucks,\" said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz &amp; Co.\nFord Chairman Alex Trotman said in a statement that automotive earnings will improve in 1997, because the company has successfully completed its highest-volume launches in North America and Europe.\n\"We're starting 1997 in a much stronger competitive position,\" he said.\nTrotman said Ford expects better results for all of 1997 in Europe, where the company is moving to cut costs. Ford also predicted smaller losses in South America for 1997, he added.\n\"Overall, we are on track,\" he said.\nMeantime, Ford Chief Financial Officer John Devine told reporters that cost-cutting will reach new heights in 1997. For the first time, Ford expects 1997 costs to be below those of the prior year.\nThe fourth quarter results capped a mixed year for the automaker in which strong profits from its Financial Services Group were needed to offset a steady flow of red ink from overseas operations.\nEarnings for all of 1996 rose 7 percent to $4.4 billion, or $3.65 a share, from $4.1 billion, or $3.34 in 1995. Ford's worldwide automotive operations posted net income of $1.6 billion, down from $2 billion. Financial Services earned a record $2.8 billion in 1996, up 33 percent over 1995.\nRevenues for the year climbed to $147.0 billion from $137.1 billion in 1995.\nFord's core U.S. automotive operations, which contribute about 65 percent of total automotive revenues, reported profits of $628 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $168 million a year ago.\nFord continued to have problems overseas, but there were signs of progress in turning those operations around. Ford's European loss for the quarter rose to $88 million from $48 million. But excluding $127 million in severance charges in the 1996 quarter, the operating results showed a $39 million profit, versus a $26 million operating profit last year.\nIn South America, where Ford has struggled in the Brazilian market, the fourth quarter net loss was $287 million, compared with a $112 million loss a year ago.\n\"I thought the fourth quarter was an okay quarter. What was most important was improvement on the cost front,\" said Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.\nOn Tuesday, General Motors Corp. said strike costs slashed fourth quarter earnings by 50 percent to $786 million. Chrysler Corp. last week said fourth quarter earnings fell to $807 million, down from $1.04 billion.\nFord's stock lost 12.5 cents to close at 32.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "Financial market pundits in Hong Kong are closely watching the territory's top civil servants for any sign of discontent in the government as the British colony speeds towards its merger with China on July 1.\nCredited with integrity and common sense, the continued tenure of the top echelon of Hong Kong's civil service is often cited as the key to a successful transition 41 days away. (Corrects from \"less than 40 days away\")\nSpeculation is intense in Hong Kong financial and political circles that friction has emerged between top officials such as Chief Secretary Anson Chan and Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, and future leader Tung Chee-hwa over policy.\n\"At the end of the day what we are most concerned about is whether the current status of the current coterie is maintained and that there will not be some substantial policy mistake,\" said a senior broker, who declined to be named.\n\"The likelihood of that would be increased if, for example, Donald Tsang was not in office.\"\nOther financial market experts agreed, but warned against focusing on any one individual.\n\"I wouldn't have any disagreement with those views, but I'm wondering to what extent any one person (is irreplaceable),\" said Eric Nickerson, currency analyst at Bank of America.\n\"I would think that they'd try to move away from that, and that would be a positive if that could be achieved.\"\nRecent comments by Chan calling for a credible legislature as soon as possible after the handover rekindled speculation about her future as second-in-command to Tung, who was chosen by a China-controlled committee to govern after Britain departs.\n\"We have an obligation to the community to ensure that they are represented by a credible and authoritative legislature in which they, and the international community have confidence,\" Chan told a business conference in Manila on Monday.\n\"Otherwise, the credibility and authority of the future administration itself will be weakened.\"\nChan did not specifically mention the China-appointed provisional legislature, which will replace the current council on July 1. But pro-China politician Lau Siu-Kai told a newspaper Chan's remarks implied she did not feel the provisional body was a credible and authoritative legislature.\nThis might undermine her future working relationship with the interim body, Lau told the South China Morning Post.\nDonald Tsang has also been the subject of speculation following his opposition to changes to civil liberties laws.\n\"Tsang and Chan are the only senior members of the inner circle who have spoken out against the current measures and at the end of the day, that's what matters,\" the broker said.\n\"We need people who are prepared to maintain the status quo in terms of Hong Kong's foreign exchange policy and the general course of monetary policy.\"\nBoth China and Hong Kong have stressed repeatedly their commitment to the \"one country, two systems\" policy guiding Hong Kong back to the motherland, but political scientists said some friction was inevitable.\n\"These senior civil servants will say that we have been doing very well, there is no need to make changes while the other side says that these are colonial things and if changes need to be made we have no hesitation,\" said Joseph Cheng, professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong.\nBoth sides will have to be flexible and adjust, he said, and warned that an early resignation would send a bad signal.\n\"It's not so much the individual. It's that people will ask why a top civil servant wants to leave. What is wrong? And this will affect confidence in Hong Kong,\" he said.\n", "Chrysler Corp. will report record earnings for 1996, based on record worldwide sales of 2.97 million vehicles, company chairman Robert Eaton said Tuesday.\n\"We're going to have a record year,\" Eaton said in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show.\nChrysler's previous annual profit record came in 1994, when the company earned $3.713 billion. It earned $2.025 billion in 1995, when sales were held to 2.61 million units by the launch of its current line of minivans.\nEaton also said Chrysler in 1997 should be able to exceed its 1996 sales results because the company will be able to produce about 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than in 1996.\nThe increase will be come from added capacity for the new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle in Newark, Del., as well as increased assembly line speeds for the Dodge Ram pickup truck in St. Louis, and increased production of Dodge Dakota pickup trucks in Warren, Mich.\nChrysler planned to unveil the Durango at the Detroit auto show later Tuesday.\nEaton said despite sluggish industrywide car sales and the increasing popularity and profitability of light trucks, the automaker has not cut back on investment in future car programmes.\nHe said, however, that Chrysler may shift its investment plans if trucks continued to gain market share.\n\"We're going to put the money where the market goes,\" he said, adding that new, more efficient truck engines should allow Chrysler to continue to increase truck capacity without violating federal fuel economy laws.\nEaton reiterated that Chrysler can earn still earn a profit even if U.S. automotive industry sales fall by 20 percent.\nSeparately, Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert Lutz, who recently cut back on his corporate responsibilities, said he he still saw himself as an integral part of Chrysler's product creation activities.\n\"I don't see that anything changed,\" Lutz said. As of Jan. 1, Lutz gave up his president and chief operating officer titles to become vice chairman in anticipation of his 65th birthday in February.\nLutz is largely credited with turning around Chrysler's product development operations by instituting a system of super-efficient \"platform teams\" to bring each new vehicle to market. He said he will continue to act as a coach and mentor to engineers working on Chrysler's car and truck programmes.\nLutz said he will probably stay at Chrysler for a maximum of two more years.\n\"I have to use this transitional period to ease myself out gradually, because the harsh reality is that I cannot stay around until I'm 70,\" he said. \"I would be seriously worried about a company that had its product fortunes guided by a 70-year-old guy. That usually results in cars directed at 70-year-olds.\"\nChrysler stock was unchanged at $35.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "British leisure and brewery group Whitbread Plc said on Thursday it had appointed David Thomas as its chief executive designate to take over from Peter Jarvis who is to step down next summer.\nThomas's appointment was viewed by the investment community as a natural progression from the Jarvis era, which saw Whitbread aggressively transform itself from a brewer to a diversified leisure company in less than six years.\nSince 1985, Whitbread has changed its business mix. Beer now only accounts for 14 percent of profits, with the rest coming from its managed estates, restaurant and leisure arm.\nAnalysts expect Thomas to press ahead with Whitbread's expansion into the leisure and restaurant business while retaining its interest in brewing.\n\"It's just going to be basically more of the same, he's going to continue to take them down the retail, leisure route,\" said Charles Winston, an analyst at BZW.\nA slide in Whitbread shares, down 12.5p at 763p, was attributed more to profit-taking than any disappointment at the new executive appointment.\n\"It's more of a tribute to Jarvis than a thumbs down for Thomas. They have also had a very good run up of late,\" said one analyst who declined to be named.\n\"We knew he was going to leave before retirement age although these announcements are always a bit of a surprise when they come,\" said John Beaumont, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.\nBut he added: \"The appointment of David Thomas seems like a natural progression for the company.\"\nThomas, who was appointed to the main board in 1991 and took over the restaurant and leisure division in 1992, is credited with accelerating the development of Whitbread's existing brands -- Travel Inn, restaurants TGI Friday's and Beefeater.\nHe was also the architect of Whitbread's drive into the pub food market through Brewers Fayre.\nJarvis, aged 55, has hinted to reporters at recent news conferences that he would prefer to leave the company before reaching retirement age in order to pursue outside interests. He is currently a non-executive director of Burton, Rank and Barclays Plc.\n", "Bargaining between union and American Axle Manufacturing Inc. negotiators was expected to continue up to the midnight Friday deadline to avoid a strike that would quickly paralyse General Motors Corp.'s U.S. light truck production.\nAbout 7,200 United Auto Workers union members were ready to walk off the job at five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y., if no agreement was reached on a new three-year contract.\nAmerican Axle, which was spun off from GM into a private company in 1994, supplies virtually all of the rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars, as well as various parts for other passenger car lines.\nThe company also makes axles for Chrysler Corp. and axle shafts for Ford Motor Co.\nTight inventories at American Axle and Dana Corp., the other primary axle maker in the United States, means GM's light truck plants would run out of parts by early next week, analysts said.\n\"They can't have more than two days supply because there is no excess capacity in the industry,\" said James Harbour, president of Harbour &amp; Associates Inc., a Troy, Mich.-based consulting firm.\nBurnham Securities Inc. analyst David Healy estimated GM could lose $20 million a day in after-tax profits if it was forced to suspend light truck production. Labour strife cost the world's largest automaker $1.2 billion in 1996.\nThe American Axle situation is the latest labour dispute to flare up in the automotive supplier industry since the beginning of the year. Analysts say they signal a new era as the UAW steps up efforts to organise more component workforces and bring pay levels in line with those of the Big Three.\n\"It's the next phase of the evolution of change,\" said Donna Parolini, president of International Business Development Corp., a Troy, Mich. supplier consulting firm.\nUAW membership among independent, or non-Big Three, suppliers has dropped dramatically over the last 20 years so that now less than 20 percent of the independent parts workers belong to the UAW, she said.\nThe American Axle talks are notable because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract. When the firm was spun off under former Chrysler manufacturing chief Richard Dauch, it agreed to uphold terms of the previous UAW contract, which expired last September.\nUnion officials have said the company is balking at following the Big Three pattern deal hammered out last fall. That contract guarantees employment for 95 percent of current workers, and allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $19.\nAmrican Axle, however, wants to start new hires at 60 percent of the base wage -- and extend the time it takes to reach the full rate to six years. The Big Three pact has a \"grow-in\" rate of three years.\nLast month, two Johnson Controls Inc. seat plants were hit with strikes by newly organised UAW workers. As of the Friday an agreement had not been reached in the 18-day-old strike.\nThe walkouts prompted Ford to take the unprecedented action of refusing to accept seats made by non-union replacements. Ford later signed up Johnson Controls' main competitor, Lear Corp., to supply it with seats for the Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, one of those affected by the strike.\nParolini released figures Friday that showed the global supplier industry consolidating at a faster rate than previously thought. By the end of this year, there will be about 8,000 suppliers -- down from 30,000 in 1988.\nIn the past 22 months, there have been more than 320 acqusitions or mergers valued at a total of $32 billion. The mergers will likely result in layoffs as the companies seek to gain efficiencies. For instance, Parolini said companies such as Lear and Johnson Controls have issued internal mandates to reduce headcount by 20 percent next year.\n", "If there was any doubt that Prime Minister John Howard's government is obsessed with keeping the \"battlers\" happy, then Treasurer Peter Costello wiped those out on Wednesday.\nCostello could have simply given up his veto on big bank mergers, passing on any bank merger judgement to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) if, as he said, his primary concern was to make the banks more competitive.\nThe Wallis Inquiry, which Costello set up, recommended he do just that.\nInstead he kept the veto and made up his own mind about how competitive the banks are now by telling the big four they could not merge until they become more competitive.\nIt's the ACCC's job to judge if a merger reduces competition and Costello is happy to let them pass jugdement in every other sector of the economy, so why not let ACCC Chairman Allan Fels decide on the banks?\nThe answer became clear when Costello was asked just this question in his news conference on Wednesday. Here's his reply.\n\"We are a government. We are elected. We are going to account to the Australian people and we have reserved to ourselves, at this stage, the decision that there will not be mergers between the four majors, and we have reserved to ourselves the decision to ensure that the Australian financial system still has healthy Australian ownership.\n\"We consider that a matter of public policy.\"\nCostello's motivation becomes even clearer when you look at his reasoning for keeping a 'four pillars' policy.\n\"We do not have a competitive enough access for small business to financial services,\" he said.\n\"One of the things that we would be interested in seeing is new entrants, non-bank institutions, starting to develop widely used financial lending practices, in relation to small business.\"\nFor small business, read 'battlers'.\nThe same battlers John Howard has pledged to serve again and again since his election on March 3 last year.\nHoward knows the battlers at least dislike the large banks and that they fear what the banks might do to bank fees and charges if they were allowed to get even more powerful.\nEven the banks' own consumer surveys show they are very unpopular.\nThe last thing Howard wants is the ACCC telling him a bank merger is all right and being forced to swallow it.\nThe battlers, and therefore Howard, know better.\nThe prognosis for a change of heart is not good.\nIf the government cannot ignore the politics of bank mergers when it has a massive majority in the lower house, is two years out from the next scheduled election, and is in its first term of government, then when will it?\nSome bank analysts expect a change of heart after the inevitable election win in 1999.\nDon't bet on it while Costello and Howard are bowing to the battlers.\n-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730\n", "British broadcaster Carlton Communications Plc on Wednesday reported an 11 percent rise in half-year earnings helped by a strong growth in advertising revenue.\nCarlton, which operates ITV commercial television licences for London weekday TV, the English Midlands and the west of England, raised pre-tax profits to 158.6 million pounds ($262.5 million) from 143.3 million after a one-off loss of around 4.0 million pounds.\nLifting half-year dividend by 12 percent to 4.9 pence and sending the company's shares jumping, chairman Michael Green pledged that the group would continue to invest in businesses -- and boost prospects.\n\"We have maintained our clear focus, built up our market leading positions and enhanced both our profitability and our prospects for future growth,\" he said in the results statement.\n\"We will continue to build on this approach and make sure Carlton makes the best of its excellent prospects.\"\nThe results helped restore some enthusiasm in Carlton's shares, which have been underperforming the market by around 15 percent in the last three months. By mid-morning, the stock leapt 18.5 pence to 517.5p.\nCarlton, whose library boasts over 7,500 hours of TV programmes including almost 1,000 films, said its core broadcast business was one of the main drivers behind profits, seeing a 19 percent rise on the operating level to 72.6 million pounds.\nAn 11 percent rise in advertising revenues, higher programme sales and a 5.2 million pound trading contribution from newly acquired businesses such as Westcountry TV helped boost earnings.\nRobert Jolliffe, media analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, is forecasting unchanged full-year pretax profits of 343 million pounds and said the performance of some of Carlton's divisions -- such as its products arm -- had been \"extraordinarily strong\" at the half-way stage.\n\"Carlton airtime sales continue to dominate ITV. They've seen good market share gains and a strong London market -- so they've done very well in the first half,\" he added.\nCarlton's share of ITV's advertising revenue edged up to 32.58 percent from 31.75 percent while telecoms, financial services and airline groups raised advertising spend in a battle to win new clients and keep old ones.\nBut some brokers, such as BZW, are warning that the advertising revenue outlook over the next four to five years in Britain should be questioned against a background of increasing competition, analysts say.\nAnother highlight in Carlton's results was its fast-growing Quantel division, which designs and manufactures tapeless editing and broadcasting systems for the film and television industry worldwide.\nOperating profits leapt 28 percent to 26.2 million pounds, fulfilling expectations of rapid growth. Some analysts expect new product launches to feed through into the bottom line in the next 12-18 months.\nBut Carlton's video division cast a pall over results, with operating profits slipping to 36.2 million pounds on 12 percent lower turnover of 242.4 million.\nChairman Green blamed the slow start to the year on the timing of releases and variations in the mix of the business, but added that he was optimistic about making progress in the second half.\nAnalysts are awaiting news on whether Carlton and its partners in British Digital Broadcasting (BDB) have been awarded key digital terrestrial TV licences in Britain.\nCarlton in January joined rival TV giant Granada Group Plc and Rupert Murdoch's dominant pay-per-view broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc to form the formidable BDB.\nBDB wants to offer some 15 subscription channels. The group faces competition from Digital Television Network (DTN), owned by Nasdaq-listed NTL Inc -- but in what has been dubbed a classic case of David versus Goliath, most analysts tip BDB as the winner.\nCarlton, which has a cash pile of 166 million pounds, said it expected the Independent Television Commission watchdog to award the licence by the end of June.\n\"Digital terrestrial television brings enormous opportunities to Carlton,\" Green stated.\n($ = 0.604 British Pounds)\n", "French Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole said on Saturday it would take full control of merchant bank Banque Indosuez from financial holding company Compagnie de Suez on December 23.\nThe two companies said in a joint statement that the total price would be 11.9 billion francs.\nCredit Agricole bought a 51 percent stake in the merchant bank in July for 6.3 billion francs and will on Monday pay the outstanding 5.6 billion francs.\nCompagnie de Suez said its 1996 annual result, expected to be published on April 2, would show a 300 million franc capital gain on the transaction.\nUnder the original sale terms, Credit Agricole would have bought an additional 29 percent in July 1997 and the remaining 20 percent on January 1, 2000.\n\"It has been a joint decision to speed up the transaction,\" Compagnie de Suez spokeswoman Michele Meyzie told Reuters.\n\"Credit Agricole has engaged a restructuring of its activities and this is easier to pursue when it has full control of Indosuez. At the same time, for us it is welcome to have the capital gain and the 5.6 billion francs in cash,\" she added.\nThe companies said than an audit ended at June 30 this year showed that the value of Indosuez was 11.790 billion francs to which was added some interest.\nIn May, when the orginal deal between the two companies was announced, the vale of the bank was put at 11.85 billion francs.\nCredit Agricole is setting up an international investment bank under the Banque Indosuez name -- combining French brokers Cheuvreux de Virieu, Dynabourse and Hayaux de Tilly.\nIn asset management, there is the combination of Indosuez and Segespar which have a combined 650 billion francs under management.\nOn Friday, Dutch savings bank SNS said it was buying Banque Indosuez Nederland NV.\nGerard Mestrallet, the former head of Societe Generale de Belgique who was appointed chairman of parent Suez in July 1995 after a messy board room battle, is restructuring the holding company which suffers from heavy property losses.\nIn June, Mestrallet said he expected a return to profit in 1996 after a pre-tax loss of 3.9 billion francs in 1995.\nCredit Agricole has a five percent stake in Suez.\n", "Britain cleared U.S. utility CE Electric's 782 million pound ($1.29 billion) hostile takeover bid for Northern Electric on Friday, just days ahead of a final deadline for shareholders to accept the offer.\nRemoving the first hurdle to the deal, trade and industry minister Ian Lang said in a statement: \"CE Electric has given me assurances to address the regulatory concerns...These include assurances relating to Northern's financial and management resources and to maintaining Northern's financial status.\"\nThe 650 pence-per-share bid, which electricity supply group Northern has said \"short changes\" investors, closes next Friday.\nNorthern says it has the backing of major investor Prudential Corporation, which owns more than 11 percent of its shares and has bought more at 600 pence apiece.\nPrudential traditionally tends to back the target company's board in a hostile takeover situation. But in the latest war of words, CE Electric said it also had major investors on its side and was confident of victory.\n\"I believe investors will now back the offer. They have seen it cleared and there is no white knight (bidder) on the horizon. We are now confident of getting above the 50 percent threshold,\" said David Sokol, CE Electric's chairman and chief executive.\n\"The decision for shareholders is now crystal clear. You just have to look at the facts. The stock was at 495 pence per share before we came in with our (first) bid (at 630 pence).\n\"The stock will plummet if it's not accepted. Add to that the fact that the FTSE 100 index is looking at a correction. Here is an opportunity to take a very large profit, cash in the bank.\"\nNorthern shares were up sharply on news of the deal being cleared, rising 41 pence to 643.50. The British utility's share price had been sluggish in recent sessions on fears that the deal could be blocked.\nBut Northern's latest rebuttal said acceptance would mean shareholders \"giving up almost one pound per share in dividends over the next nine months and to forego a prospective 1997/98 yield of over 10.5 percent.\"\nNorthern's defence has said it is worth more than 650 pence a share, with some analysts saying it is holding out for 700 pence.\nThe electricity firm has outlined plans to realise value by merging its electricity and gas supply businesses with another regional player. It also wants to develop a 50 megawatt gas-fired power station in a joint venture with Rolls Royce .\nEverything now hangs on next Friday, with both sides keeping up the campaign to clinch support from big investors.\nCE Electric has 30 percent of shares in the bag and four percent of acceptances, needing 50 percent of Northern shares to win.\nNorthern had already escaped the clutches of one predator -- conglomerate Trafalgar House -- last year. The electricity group won the day with a 560 million pound defence package.\nBut the package -- awash with cash -- prompted the electricity regulator to take a closer look at bumper industry profits, resulting in tougher price controls which wiped billions of pounds off shares in the sector.

But analysts saw little change in market sentiment amid mostly domestic trading as investment funds settled positions before the end of the year.\n\"This doesn't really look like a rebound to me. (Mainly) there's a bit of domestic buying and some of the local brokers are just bidding up the market,\" Alex Angell of the brokerage Wood and Company said.\nThe PX50 index closed up 0.56 percent at 521.1 at its daily price fixing on Thursday, putting the bourse about nine percent higher than its low in mid-November.\nThe PSE stumbled through most of the autumn, losing close to 20 percent as key investors sold positions, tired of a market characterised as unregulated and murky.\nAlthough eastern Europe's most-capitalised bourse, the Czech market has long been plagued by poor legislation that investors say fails to provide protection for minority shareholders.\nUnder the Czech Republic's Securities Act, devised to handle the logistics of the government's massive voucher privatisation scheme, the Securities Registry (SCP) is bound by law to provide services such as moving securities to and from client accounts.\nSince the SCP does not reveal any details of transactions, including prices and volumes, local brokers have taken to the SCP because of its privacy and faster settlement process.\nBut this has restrained activity on the PSE which sees on average $4-6 million of stock turnover each day, compared with $15 million in Warsaw, a much smaller market.\n\"There are clearly investors who have decided to stay away from this market because of its opaqueness and are still on the sidelines,\" said one international trader.\n\"This is the case especially at the end of the year when a lot of local funds push prices all over the place in order to get a desired result on their books for the year,\" he added.\nBut many analysts said that hope is not lost for the bourse.\nThey expected investors to buy back into the market as the downtrend bottoms out, although maybe not before the end of the year.\n\"I expect most of the buying to come in the New Year, but I think it means that investors already familiar with the market should do something now,\" said Danial Gladis, head of the brokerage Atlantik Financni Trhy.\nMarket officials have also begun taking steps to correct the problems which should slowly lure back disenchanted investors.\nIn April, parliament approved a series of market reforms to compel companies and fund managers to be more open and accountable. A key element tackles the chronic problem of slow and irregular reporting of company earnings and actions.\nThe PSE itself has taken several steps to brings more transparency to the market, stressing in particular the need for the early creation of an independent watchdog, though analysts said a lack of political will to establish the body remains.\n", "Australian corporate profits, largely in line with expectations in the latest earnings season just finished, are on the mend after 18 months of disappointment, analysts said.\nOverall earnings still fell but analysts are optimistic that profits for the year to June 30 should show an overall rise as economic growth gathers pace and commodity prices trend higher. The results also reflected cost cutting, as companies tear into costs to deliver earnings growth in Australia's low inflation environment, analysts said.  \nCraig Drummond, head of research at brokers J.B. Were &amp; Son, said earnings per share (EPS) for industrial companies was 1.7 percent up while resource company EPS was down four to five percent.\nThe drop in resource earnings, due mainly to lower commodity prices and a higher Australian dollar, pulled overall earnings slightly down, Drummond said.\nHe said this corporate earnings season marked the end of disappointing profits that industrial groups have posted over the past 18 months. He said both industrial and resource profits should rise in the second half of 1996/97 and calendar 1998.  \n\"The market is not really worried about this half year result and we should start with banks having reasonable results in May,\" Drummond said.\nThree of Australia's four largest banks, National Australia Bank Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, are to report their 1996/97 first half results in May.\nDavid Rees, equity strategist at brokers BT Securities: \"I think compared with 12 months ago there have been a lot of signs of improvement. I think compared with what people were expecting, ... it is pretty close to line ball.\"  \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, pastoral and energy group Wesfarmers Ltd and retailers Woolworths Ltd and Coles Myer Ltd all reported better-than-expected profits.\n\"I think what is important for the market is what happens next and our view is that given the evidence of cost cutting and restructuring, given what has happened, we are looking for improvements across a whole range of companies,\" Rees said.\nRees said there should also be earnings improvements coming from the growth in Australia's capital expenditure (capex), which the government expects to be about 17 percent for 1996/97.  \n\"What we are now looking for is the follow through from capex ... to the bottom line,\" Rees said. Analysts said many companies improved their 1996/97 half profits by cost cutting.\nMarcus Tuck, economist at HSBC James Capel, said: \"Generally the cost cutting has been good and you could say that managers are slowly learning to deal with a low inflation environment.\"\nAustralia, which has enjoyed 22 quarters of continuous economic growth, has only seen three quarters with inflation rates above five percent and has had 12 quarters since June 1991 with an inflation rate below two percent.  \nWith the results season out of the way, investors are currently more concerned about the outlook for U.S. interest rates, said Mark O'Brien, head of equities at Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP).\n\"The results that have been coming out having been largely in line.

Thursday reported a 17 percent rise in third-quarter profits, an unusually small rate for the company.\n3Com executives told investors, however, they expect business to pick up again in the fourth quarter and said that, contrary to fears among Wall Street investors, the industry does not face an extracted slowdown.\n\"We do not expect that the demand weakness we saw in December will recur,\" said Eric Benhamou, 3Com chief executive. \"The fundamentals of the industry remain very strong and the potential remains for the industry to sustain growth rates in the 30 to 50-percent range in the coming years.\"\n3Com, the second-biggest maker of networking equipment after Cisco Systems Inc., said net income rose to $87.6 million, or 47 cents a share, from $74.6 million, or 42 cents, in the same quarter a year ago.\nThe company announced last month it was acquiring consumer computer modem giant U.S. Robotics Corp. in a stock deal valued at $7.3 billion.\nWall Street, after having been warned a month ago by executives that the company faced a difficult quarter, expected 3Com to earn 46 cents a share, according to a recent survey by First Call.\nRevenue for the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 30 percent to $786.8 million from $606 million a year ago.\n3Com makes electronic devices that send information through computer networks. In December, the company had unusually weak sales because of falling product prices and aggressive moves by competitors Cisco and Intel Corp.\nThe warning set off a month-long slide of networking stocks and spurred concerns that the industry segment had seen its best days. Since the warning, 3Com's shares have lost more than half their value in seven weeks.\n3Com shares on Thursday closed up $1.44 at $33.63.\n\"It looks like the worst is behind them, although it could take at least a quarter or two for them to get things back in line,\" said Noel Lindsey, analyst at investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. in San Francisco.\nBenhamou's positive remarks also likely will boost 3Com's stock Friday, Lindsey said.\nAbout 45 percent of 3Com's revenue comes from the sale of networking adapter cards, the graham-wafer-sized devices that plug into PCs to connect them to networks. 3Com said adapter card revenue rose 39 percent in the third quarter to $346.3 million.\n3Com also sells switches and hubs, the devices that shuffle information through networks. Sales of these system products rose 24 percent to $432.6 million.\nBenhamou said the company is bringing expenses in line with revenue. He also said strong sales throughout Asia is offsetting weakness in Japan. Similarly, strong British sales are mitigating weak sales in Germany, he said.\n\"During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our high-end\" network equipment, 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou said in a statement, \"and the number of multimillion-dollar orders we received from large accounts has never been greater.\"\n\"At the same time, our industry is in the midst of many important transitions,\" Benhamou added, citing the adoption of higher-speed technologies, new methods for directing network traffic and pricing and distribution increasingly based on volume sales.\nHe said that as a result of these changes, 3Com's results in the latest quarter reflected increased price competition and a pause in industry demand as corporate networking customers and network service providers assess how to maximize their investments in computer networks.\nBut he added the changes were \"positive for 3Com and the industry in the long run.\"\nThe acquisition of U.S. Robotics, the leading worldwide maker of modems for the consumer market, will create a company with annual revenues topping $5 billion.\nUnder terms of the agreement, each share of Skokie, Ill.-based U.S. Robotics will be exchanged for 1.75 shares of 3Com stock.\n", "Scottish-based Stakis Plc on Wednesday reported a surge in visitors to its casinos and a sharp rise in its hotel room rates, with chief executive David Michel in confident mood about future trends.\n\"In real terms we are just back to where room rates were in the late 1980s. Room rates have just about reached their pre-recession levels in the provinces,\" Michels told Reuters.\nThe company's hotels, excluding the Metropole in London acquired in November for 327 million stg ($543 million) from Lonrho, showed an occupancy level of 71.8 percent in the first 13 weeks of 1997, a touch down from 72 percent last time.\nBut its average room rate rose to 50.10 stg over the same period, up from 45.58 in 1996.\n\"In the first quarter we did 10 percent, but I still think the average will be 7.5 percent or more over the year,\" said Michels. \"Our forecast is to finish this year at 76 percent occupancy,\" he added.\nAlthough January was a typically dull month for hotel occupancy, future bookings are at similar levels to last year, giving every confidence Stakis can achieve its target, he said.\nThe group's hotel occupancy was also pulled back slightly in the period by the temporary closure of the Stakis Tyneside where work is underway on a 3.5 million stg refurbishment.\nDuring the six weeks Metropole traded under the Stakis flag, it showed 64.7 percent occupancy at an average price per room of 64.77 stg for its 2,266 rooms.\nIn a trading statement, Stakis said attendance at its 23 casinos rose to 603,000 in the quarter up from 525,000, but the spend per head fell to 110 stg from 129 .\nTurnover at the casinos rose 20 percent to 14.2 million stg driven by the 17 percent increase in attendances.\nThe fall in spend per head mainly reflected the sale of the Barracuda casino in April last year to Ladbroke, said Michel. The spend per head at the Barracuda averaged 450 stg.\nBut Michel was encouraged by the increased casino attendance. \"More people realise that they are a reasonable night out, you don't have to spend 100 stg,\" he said.\n\"We have spent a year trying to make them do so, we've made a number of conversions, one big new build, and promotions to our base membership of 900,000, and we have introduced new training tables.\"\nThe improvements coincided with an increase in newspaper and television interest in casinos.\nStakis shares were up 1-1/2p at 103p in early trade.

The sale was reserved for small companies.\nPrivately-held Pocket's big creditors include a group of Asian entrepreneurs and communications-equipment makers Siemens AG of Germany and L.M. Ericsson of Sweden.\n\"It enables the company to develop a plan to improve our financial health\" while continuing to build a wireless phone system, Pocket Chairman Daniel Riker said of the company's filing Monday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.\nPocket, based in Washington, said it would take \"several months\" to restructure its finances and business affairs before the company would emerge from the Chapter 11 process on firm financial footing.\nThe Federal Communications Commission on Monday gave PCS companies from last year's auction some breathing space when it suspended indefinitely a March 31 deadline for them to make payments to the agency for their licenses.\nThe FCC took the step while mulling a request from NextWave, Pocket and seven other winners for permission to make the payments annually instead of quarterly.\nThe bids have become loans from the government, with the winners paying interest on the money owed for the licenses.\n\"When you're out trying to raise capital, investors don't like to see their money go toward interest,\" said Kevin Inda, a Pocket vice president.\nThe company has had to postpone initial public stock and bond offerings until the market for PCS stocks improve.\nAnalysts foresee a shakeout in the industry as a host of new players engage in a city-by-city battle for market share with established cellular providers typically owned by big regional Baby Bell companies and long-distance carriers.\nPocket's bankruptcy filing is expected to send a shudder through the ranks of the other auction winners who are trying to drum up money from wary investors.\n\"Pocket was a respected company that was considered to have put together a sensible plan,\" said Edward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine. \"It won't make financing more available.\"\nPocket said it has about $1 billion in assets, largely the value of its licenses, and about $1.5 billion in liabilities. The latter is largely the long-term debt owed to the FCC.\nThe company's 43 licenses cover 35 million potential U.S. customers in markets such as Chicago, Detroit, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, New Orleans, Las Vegas and Honolulu.\nPocket's financing plans had hinged on an initial public offering planned for last fall.

In 1994 Packer led a consortium to bid for the 12-year Sydney casino licence, but lost out to the Showboat led consortium in December 1994.\nSince losing the Sydney casino license bid, Packer interests have launched several legal actions against Showboat for the award of the licence by the New South Wales (NSW) government.\nPacker's punt on SHC shares have already made him a profit as shares in both the casino owner and PBL rose strongly after the deal was announced before Monday's sharemarket open.\nIn early afternoon trade, SHC shares were at a record high of A$2.27, a 34 cent or 17.61 percent rise in active trade, while PBL shares were 25 cents higher at A$6.35.\nThe deal was good for both companies as Packer's influence was likely to yield a tax-concession for the casino on the high-roller market, which is seen boosting cash flow for both the casino and PBL, Australian market analysts said.\nSHC owns the only legal casino in Australia's largest city and has battled the New South Wales state government for the past 16 months to get a similar tax rate to other Australian casinos.\n\"I think Packer will probably get the tax-break from the government,\" one Sydney-based casino analyst said. \"I expect there will be some tax-break announcement this month,\" he said.\nThe Sydney casino is seeking a 10 percent tax concession from the state government on big spending gamblers, mainly from Asia, compared with the present tax rate of 27 percent.\nPBL is also expected to end the disappointing run of operating results the casino has reported since it opened a temporary casino in September 1995. The casino is expected to open a A$1.0 billion permanment casino later this year.\nPacker also has a 10 percent stake in Melbourne casino operator Crown Ltd and about 20 percent of Hudson Conway Ltd, which in turn owns 37 percent of Crown.\n\"Given the Packer-Hudson Conway type of relationship it looks like there is a bit more to come out of this one,\" said Richard Wolf, a casino analyst at Bell Securities.\n(A$1 = 78 U.S. cents)\n", "Chinese authorities have imposed a curfew on a town in the mainly Moslem region of northwestern Xinjiang after at least 10 people were killed in a separatist riot last week, officials and local residents said on Monday.\nAt least 10 people were killed and many wounded last Wednesday when 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining, smashing cars, burning shops and beating up Han Chinese to protest against Beijing rule.\n\"Both Han Chinese and Uighurs were killed or injured,\" a propaganda official said by telephone from Yining in the near the border with Kazakhstan.\nA Chinese source with close links to the government said the separatist riot was among the most violent for many years in Xinjiang, where Moslems are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up just 38 percent of the population.\n\"A circular has been issued and broadcast on television ordering people not to go out after dark,\" said one local resident, a Han Chinese. \"We don't go out after the sun sets. There is a curfew every night.\"\nLocal officials described the riot as a small incident fuelled by unidentified \"foreign hostile forces\" and refused to say how many people had been killed or injured.\nHowever, the Chinese source said at least 10 people had been killed, including one police officer, and many wounded and arrested.\n\"One police officer was stabbed to death,\" said the source, who declined to be further identified.\nThe Hong Kong-based Ming Pao newspaper said rioters set fire to the bodies of those killed. About 100 were wounded, it said.\nThe rioters attacked ethnic Han Chinese on sight, smashed cars and set fire to shops, forcing local authorities to send out about 1,000 police and paramilitary People's Armed Police to quell the riot, one Han resident said.\n\"They said they wanted the Han out of Xinjiang,\" he said.\nThe riot erupted after a Chinese policeman tried to arrest a man of the ethnic Uighur minority, the Chinese source said.\n\"The police tried to arrest a Uighur criminal suspect but the suspect and his family resisted arrest,\" the source told Reuters by telephone.\n\"The scene attracted neighbours and onlookers and the crowd swelled to more than 1,000 and turned into rioting,\" he said. \"The police were called in and fired teargas to dispel the crowd.\"\nThe demonstrators, shouting anti-Chinese slogans, had marched on a government building and police had asked them to disperse, said the propaganda official in Yining, about 700 km (440 miles) northwest of the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi.\n\"There was a demonstration and they shouted slogans calling for Han Chinese to be driven out of Xinjiang and for Xinjiang to be split from the motherland,\" he said, adding that the rioters had \"used the pretext of religion\".\nThe festival to mark the end of Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting, fell at the weekend, overlapping with China's celebration of the biggest holiday in its calendar, the lunar new year, last Friday.\nXinjiang, considered by many Chinese a wild frontier territory, has a long history of ethnic clashes between the native population of mainly Moslem ethnic minorities and the ruling Han Chinese.\n", "Australian Treasurer Peter Costello's construction of a road-block in front of National Australia Bank Ltd's takeover plans has paradoxically made the bank look more attractive, analysts said on Wednesday.\nBut they said Costello's announcement that he would not allow a big bank merger until parts of the sector became more competitive tarnished the takeover premium built into Westpac Banking Corp's share price in particular.  \nInvestors who had expected National Australia Bank (NAB) to be given the green light to go on the big bank merger warpath pushed NAB's share price 2.5 percent higher, happy for now it will not have to make a big share issue to finance a takeover.\n\"The price movement in NAB is a reflection in the short term that the market sees it as a positive NAB won't be an acquirer because of the potential dilution of a share issue to fund such a takeover,\" said one senior Sydney bank analyst.\n\"NAB was underpriced and to the extent that a big rights isuse was hanging over the market, it makes sense for it to kick up a bit,\" said Macquarie Equities analyst Graham Maloney.  \nNAB closed up 39 cents at A$16.11 after Treasurer Costello ended the \"Six Pillars\" policy banning mergers between the four major banks and two major life groups, but said the four majors would have to wait for stronger competition before merging.\nWestpac Banking Corp, seen as the most vulnerable to takeover, closed down 20 cents at A$6.67, while ANZ Banking Group Ltd closed down 11 cents at A$7.89.\n\"There was a margin of acquisition premium there, particularly in Westpac. Now that it appears that there's unlikely to be an acquisition, it makes sense to mark it back,\" Maloney said.  \nAnalysts said however that Costello's comments about ending the current blanket ban on foreign takeovers of the major banks could offset some of the sector's disappointment.\n\"The equity markets are a little bit disappointed that the 'four pillars' effectively remain, but at the end of the day there is a potential for foreign takeover,\" said J.B. Were, head or research at Craig Drummond, adding that Westpac and ANZ were not expensive banks by global standards.\n\"The only risk is that there are major foreign holders that bought into both of those banks in the expectation that there could be a major bank merger,\" Drummond said.  \n\"Some traders could still cause Westpac and ANZ to be weak in the short term.\"\nBrokers said NAB's share price appeared also to benefit from the potential for a takeover bid by a foreign group.\n\"(The Wallis report) hasn't ruled out the possibility of allowing a foreign bank to take over any of our banks -- it seems to strengthen NAB's position and also the Commonwealth's (Bank of Australia ) position,\" said Kevin Lourey, a dealer at Melbourne broker, Peake Lands Kirwan.\nCBA's shares rose 28 cents to A$12.98.  \nLonger term, analysts said the Wallis Inquiry's recommendations on freeing up access to the banking sector and allowing non-banks access to the payments system would sharpen competition and eventually put profit margins under pressure.\n\"Opening access to the payments system, I see that as critical,\" said Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson.\n\"The capacity of someone like a GE Capital to have access to the payments system is a fairly important increase in competition,\" he said.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n", "China will retain controls over the price it pays farmers for grain even after reforms trumpeted as unifying the state-set price with that of the market, official media said on Monday.\nMinister of state economic restructuring Li Tieying said last month China would this year unify the price for compulsory sales of grain to the state with market prices, a reform aimed at boosting the role of the market in the agricultural sector.\nHowever, provincial authorities would continue to have the final say on the price they paid for grain, the Xinhua news agency on Monday quoted Wang Lingui of the State Grain Reserve Administration as saying.\n\"The purchasing price will be determined by governments at provincial levels on the basis of the market price,\" the official agency quoted Wang as saying.\nSteep hikes in the official grain purchase price and falls in market prices caused by a record 480-million-tonne grain harvest in 1996 meant the time was right for reform, Wang said.\nBut he added that market trends would not be the only factors considered.\n\"The market price forms a principal basis for setting a purchasing price, but is not the only criteria,\" he said. \"Therefore, the purchasing price should not necessarily follow the market price.\"\nGrain traders said last month the difference between state purchase prices and market prices had narrowed to almost nothing, suggesting that merging the two would have little immediate impact.\nBut analysts said the government may be concerned that future bumper crops could force market prices down sharply, and in turn force farm incomes lower.\nChina's government has long paid lower-than-market prices for grain purchases to ensure state granaries are well stocked.\nBeijing's communist leadership has for years tried to free grain prices, but all attempts have fallen foul of fears that uncontrolled rises could push food prices beyond the pockets of urban residents and spark social unrest.\nA government spokesman last month voiced apparent unease about unifying state and market grain prices, saying farmers' enthusiaism for planting grain would be sapped if prices fell.\nThe annual state grain-collection quota of 50 million tonnes would remain unchanged under the planned reforms, allowing the state to guide grain production, stabilise the acreage sown and maintain stable grain price, Wang said.\n\"Meanwhile, building a protective price system, which will set a ceiling on the market price and the bottom line of the purchasing price, is a must,\" Xinhua quoted Wang as saying without elaborating.\nThe state price should be allowed to move over time to encourage farmers to hold on to their grain and so ease harvest-time pressures on state granaries, he said but gave no details.\n", "The French government on Wednesday called off the controversial sale of electronics group Thomson SA in a major policy U-turn after weeks of staunchly defending its choice of buyer.\nIt was the second privatisation to be halted in less than a month after a decision to suspend the sale of state-owned bank CIC.\nIt comes at a time when Prime Minister Alain Juppe, at a record low in opinion polls, is anxious to avoid another labour revolt following last month's truckers stoppage.\nThe Finance Ministry said in a statement the suspension of the proposed Thomson sell-off to Lagardere Groupe was due to objections to the planned sale of the company's consumer electronics unit to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.\nBut the office of Prime Minister Alain Juppe said renewed talks about the sale could start soon.\n\"The government will launch consultations as rapidly as possible allowing the privatisation to take place on a basis that will be defined very quickly,\" Juppe was quoted as saying.\n\"The aim of privatising Thomson addresses the necessity for France to have an electronics and defence industry of global standing,\" he said.\nIndustry Minister Franck Borotra said in a statement the privatisation of Thomson remained essential\n\"The goal of privatisation of Thomson, and in particular TMM (Thomson Multimedia), remains essential for the future of the company,\" Borotra said.\n\"TMM needs to cuts its debt, enter new markets and improve its competitiveness in order to better exploit its technological and human resources,\" he added.\nSeveral thousand workers of Thomson Multimedia marched in Paris and other cities on November 20 to protest against a sale to a booming Asian competitor, fearing for their jobs and working conditions.\nStaff were also enraged by Juppe telling parliament in October their hi-tech company was worthless. The prime minister said the company was \"worth not even a franc, it is worth 14 billion francs of debt.\"\nThe government said in October it had picked Lagardere because it was best for French defence interests and would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc after a 10.8 billion franc ($2 billion) state capital injection.\nLagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58-percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its own Matra Defense Espace.\nThe Finance Ministry's surprise suspension announcement came on the day the European Commission had been expected to give the green light to the deal.\nThe ministry said the Privatisation Commission \"declared itself incapable of giving a favourable opinion to the Lagardere Groupe offer, because of the terms of Daewoo Electronics' purchase of Thomson Multimedia.\"\nIt added the companies could continue their discussions with the Privatisation Commission and the state would pursue talks with the European Commission about conditions for a capital increase, on which Brussels had expressed reservations.\nShares in Lagardere and Thomson-CSF were suspended, while those of Alcatel fell three percent with investors expecting the group to make a new bid that could create uncertainties about the financing and its own profit recovery.\nLagardere said in a statement it was still interested in taking over Thomson, which it said was of strategic importance. A spokesman for Alcatel Alsthom said only that the company \"took note\" of the decision.\n\"The chances (for Alcatel) have got to be increased by this, if they can come up with a different offer,\" said a Paris share broker, adding the decision was a blow to the government's standing. \"It doesn't look good for the French government.\"\nAlcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk recently said he was ready to make a new offer for Thomson, breaking weeks of silence after French newspapers suggested Chirac might have been influenced by a disputed report of British plans to take over the company.\nBritain's GEC has said it is willing to talk about a cooperation deal with whoever wins Thomson.\n($1=5.271 French Franc)\n", "Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa will unveil on Thursday revised plans to curb civil liberties and rights in the territory after it reverts to China at midnight on June 30, a spokesman from Tung's office said on Wednesday.\nThe original proposals, announced in early April, restrict demonstrations and ban overseas funding of political parties. They have been revised after Tung launched a three-week consultation exercise seeking views from the public.\n\"The proposals have been revised after the consultation, considering what people said,\" the spokesman told Reuters.\n\"We will have a compendium of the thousands of submissions...what sort of responses there were,\" he said.\nThe revised plans will be announced on Thursday by Michael Suen, a top civil servant recently seconded to Tung's office, and are expected to be made into post-handover Hong Kong laws by the China-backed provisional legislature.\nThe interim chamber, under China's plans, will itself replace Hong Kong's current elected legislature on July 1.\nTung's plans had long been expected after China's parliament, the National People's Congress, endorsed in February a proposal to change or drop some laws protecting civil rights in Hong Kong.\nTung, the territory's chief executive-designate, argues the intended changes are mere technicalities, needed to strike a balance between freedoms and social order.\nBut they have drawn a groundswell of opposition from Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp as well as strong criticism from Britain, the United States and human rights groups.\nTung's revised plans were preceded on Wednesday by a fierce debate in Hong Kong's legislative council, with prominent lawmakers condemning the controversial plans.\nIndependent legislator Christine Loh said Tung had given no basis for his intended changes to current laws that have worked well for Hong Kong.\n\"The proposals are an invitation to political self-censorship and predictably have a serious, heinous effect on participation in public affairs and an assault on the international character and public spirit of Hong Kong civil society,\" she said.\nBut a motion, put forward by Democratic Party legislator Cheung Man-kwong, expressing deep regret over the proposals, was rejected by a vote of 27 against 23.\nLegislator Ngai Shiu-kit and a member of the pro-business Labour Party argued the proposed changes were necessary.\n\"Some people have behaved themselves in such a manner in public that have given rise to some alarm,\" he said, referring to a protest last year when a group of Hong Kong activists stormed into the Japanese consulate in a row over disputed islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan.\n\"If a society is manipulated by such people, then Hong Kong will be embarking on a very dangerous path and that would not be in the overall interest of the community,\" he said.\n", "China trumpeted the 100-day mark for the recovery of Hong Kong on Sunday and hailed late leader Deng Xiaoping for his guiding role in bringing more than a century of colonial shame to a close.\nHundreds of people gathered at midnight near Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing to watch a huge electronic countdown clock as it flashed only 100 days to go before the British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1.\nOfficial newspapers covered their front pages with reports of the impending end of British colonial rule as called for under a Sino-British accord signed in 1984.\n\"We have endured 100 years of shame, 100 years of resistance and 100 years of waiting,\" said the Guangming Daily.\n\"Now in another 100 days, the hopes of generations will be realised.\"\nThe Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, devoted much of its front page to the historic occasion and the role played in it by the nation's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who died last month aged 92 before he could see his dream fulfilled.\nDeng guided China's negotiations with Britain and is credited with devising the formula of \"one country, two systems\" that allows Hong Kong to keep its capitalist system and a \"high degree of autonomy\" for 50 years.\n\"At this moment we think even more fondly of Deng Xiaoping,\" said the party newspaper.\n\"It was he who proposed the great formula of 'one country, two systems' that allowed us to peacefully resolve a thorny question left over from history and realise the complete reunification of our country...\"\nThat praise was echoed by some of the hundreds of people who braved Beijing's chilly night air to watch the countdown clock mark the last 100 days before the transfer of power in Hong Kong.\n\"This is Deng's contribution,\" said a retired office worker surnamed Chang. \"I am overjoyed.\"\nA huge roar erupted from the crowd at midnight as students waved banners saying, \"China takes the road to strength\" and chanted \"Hong Kong comes home\".\n\"I'm thrilled,\" said An Na, a student at the Chemical Industry Institute. \"I wish I didn't have to wait 100 days.\"\nChina ceded Hong Kong island to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanjing following the Opium War, and Britain later added to its holdings in the area.\nWhile China hailed the impending recovery of Hong Kong, it had barely a passing word for the British government that decided to hand back the colony peacefully rather than contest its claim to the territory.\nThe official media also had little to say about China's pledges of a \"high degree of autonomy\" under the joint accord, though it hinted at concerns in Hong Kong and elsewhere.\nThe Shenzhen Special Zone Daily, published in the border boom town of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, tried to reassure residents of Hong Kong about a report on the Chinese army garrison that will be stationed in the territory.\n\"Don't worry, dear compatriots,\" it advised its readers, without saying what they might have to worry about.\nThe People's Daily similarly sought to deflect concerns.\n\"More and more people are coming to the belief that the Chinese government is reliable and capable and will faithfully carry out its promises,\" it said.\n", "China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday dismissed British opposition to Beijing's plans to disband Hong Kong's legislature and said it would not affect the smooth transfer of power in the territory this year.\n\"The British side's opposition to this is an overreaction and unreasonable and unnecessary,\" Qian told reporters.\n\"... if they (British authorities) continue to voice their opposition to the operation of the provisional Legislative Council I don't think it will have any impact on the smooth transition of Hong Kong,\" he said.\nHong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, becoming a Special Administrative Region of China after 150 years of British rule.\nBeijing has pledged to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the transfer of power.\nChina has said it will scrap Hong Kong's existing elected Legislative Council and install an appointed provisional body in a move opposed by Britain as well as the United States.\nQian, who is also a vice-premier, conceded that foreign countries had commercial interests in Hong Kong but that did not give them the right to inferfere in the territory's affairs after the handover.\n\"No foreign country has the right to interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,\" he said, repeating Beijing's long-standing position.\nQian also held out the prospect of legislators who lost seats in Hong Kong being able to run for posts in China's parliament, the National People's Congress.\nHe said, however, they would have to recognise the Chinese constitution and accept China's procedures for choosing delegates.\nChina's parliament has little real power and its main task is to approve laws drafted by the Communist Party.\nIt has nearly 3,000 delegates and Hong Kong will be entitled to only 36 of those seats next year.\n", "Hong Kong's future lawmakers drew howls of protest from the pro-democracy camp on Saturday after they supported Beijing-backed plans to dilute civil liberties in the territory when it returns to China at midnight on June 30.\nThe democratic camp also accused the future lawmakers of the provisional legislature of selling out the people of Hong Kong by merely doing Beijing's bidding.\n\"This group, anyway, was not popularly elected, what Beijing wants, it will pass. This is a foregone conclusion,\" said Tsang Kin-shing, a legislator of Hong Kong's current elected chamber and a member of the popular Democratic Party.\n\"They are just doing it for their own advantage, I don't have any hope in them. They are just selling out on Hong Kong people,\" he told Reuters by telephone.\nThe outcry follows a meeting of the provisional legislature across the border in China's Shenzhen city earlier on Saturday, where members gave their backing to plans by Hong Kong's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, to place curbs on freedoms from July 1.\nThe plans include requiring police permits for political protests and a ban on foreign funding of political groups. They have sparked protests from Hong Kong's lawyers and human rights activists, as well as from Britain and the United States.\nBut the curbs, Tung argues, are necessary to preserve social order in Hong Kong, which will return to China on July 1 when more than 150 years of British colonial rule comes to an end.\nTung's plans were widely expected after Beijing resolved in February to repeal or amend existing Hong Kong laws protecting freedoms and political rights.\nThe 60-member interim chamber, which was selected in December under rules crafted by China, agreed with the broad principles of the planned curbs, which have yet to be drafted.\n\"Hong Kong's situation is sensitive, as at any time, but now especially Hong Kong people must be on the alert for the possibility of the region being infiltrated by hostile elements,\" said provisional legislator Elsie Tu.\n\"It is our responsibility to maintain public order and prevent interference by outside political parties.\"\nSome, however, said the curbs must be reasonable and not restrict freedoms as Hong Kong people were usually law-abiding while others urged clearer definitions of some concepts in the proposed curbs to allay fears in Hong Kong.\nTung has cited concepts such as \"national security\" as a basis for the planned curbs, but critics have criticised the idea as both alarmist and groundless.\nThe planned curbs are widely expected to go through legislative procedures before the handover and be confirmed and made into Hong Kong laws on July 1 by the interim chamber.\nThe China-backed provisional legislature has held its meetings in China rather than Hong Kong to protect itself from legal challenges by members of the elected chamber.\nChina, angered by democratic reforms introduced by the last British governor, Chris Patten, has said it will disband the elected legislature and install the provisional body as Hong Kong's official lawmaking assembly after July 1.\nThe future chamber also prepared to make its first law for Hong Kong on Saturday. A bill, covering public holidays for 1997 and 1998, passed through all three readings and will be confirmed as law on July 1, the local cable TV station reported.\nAndrew Cheng, a current legislator and Democratic Party member denounced the passage of the bill.\n\"The provisional legislature is an unconstitutional structure and they don't have any legal foundation to pass laws for Hong Kong,\" Cheng said on Radio Television Hong Kong.\n", "Britain's top financial regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) on Thursday launched a 400,000 pound ($654,000) advertising campaign designed to heighten the public's awareness of the review into pensions mis-selling.\nUnder the banner, \"Have You Lost Out On Your Pension?\", the campaign seeks to underline the importance of the public playing its part in the review.\nThe advertisements will be carried in the national press between Thursday and Sunday this week.\nThe move has been timed to coincide with the mailing of questionnaires by firms to people who have potentially been mis-sold pensions.\n\"It is vital that investors respond to the questionnaire, even if they are unable to provide all the information asked for. Otherwise, their case cannot be resolved speedily,\" the SIB said in a statement.\nJust two weeks ago regulators moved to speed up compensation payments to victims of pension misselling by banks and insurance companies in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nCompanies involved have been given an ultimatum to  settle outstanding cases in an effort to speed up the process and complete it by the end of next year.\nAs many as 1-1/2 million people may have been wrongly advised to take out personal pensions instead of staying in occupational schemes.\nA review was launched in 1994 but recent figures show that so far only around 50,000 assessments have been completed out of the 570,000 cases currently for review.\nA total 102 million pounds has been paid out in 12,650 cases where redress has been accepted, around 8,000 pounds each.

Winthrop's funding costs are expected to drop as a result, allowing it to grow its business.\n\"We've always known that somewhere down the line, we'd have to get that borrowing cost down,\" said Winthrop President David Morgan, who has agreed to continue running Winthrop after the deal is completed.\nThe deal values Winthrop at $36.50 a share, based on a TCF stock price of $47, TCF said.\nTCF shares fell 62.5 cents to $46.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Winthrop rose 37.5 cents to $34.375 on Nasdaq.\nThe deal is likely to reduce earnings per share slightly in the first full year after the acquisition, and boost earnings after that, told analysts on a conference call.\nMinneapolis-based TCF also said it has suspended its share repurchase program due to the accounting treatment it chose to use for the deal.\nThe deal is expected to close by the third quarter, subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement, a due diligence review, and approval by both companies' boards of directors, shareholders and regulators.\nTCF, with assets of $7.1 billion, has banking operations in Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio.\nThe proposed acquisition appears to fit Cooper's focus on \"power assets and power liabilites,\" said Joseph Duwan, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.\n\"The (interest rate) spreads are relatively wide, the yields are attractive, as opposed to straight commercial lending,\" Duwan said of the leasing business.\n", "Australia's largest shopping mall owner, Westfield Holdings Ltd, announced on Wednesday its U.S. arm would list on the New York Stock Exchange in May and raise US$400 million in an initial public offering.\nWestfield America Inc would then use the proceeds to go on a US$500 million shopping spree around the United States, buying out Westfield's partners in the shopping malls it already owns and buying new malls.\nThe resulting group would then be the fourth largest listed shopping mall owner in the United States, Westfield Holdings chairman Frank Lowy said.\n\"We opened a little door before and now we're opening a huge door for us to expand our business in the United States,\" Lowy told a news conference.\nLowy said Westfield America Trust would list its U.S. vehicle, CenterMark Properties Inc, as Westfield America Inc, diluting its 67.2 percent stake in CenterMark to about 50 percent.\nWestfield America would then first buy Westfield Holdings' 50 percent stake in the Garden State Plaza shopping centre in New Jersey for US$145 million.\nAbout US$210 million would then be available to buy out Westfield America's partners in shopping malls it already partly owns and to buy up new malls.\nLowy told the news conference the US$210 million of equity would be combined with debt to buy out partners and new malls.\n\"We see borrowings of maybe US$150 million to US$200 million, which gives us an opportunity to consider acquisitions of about US$350 million altogether,\" Lowy said.\nOwnership of U.S. shopping malls was increasingly transferring from private or family companies into listed public companies, and Westfield's U.S. listing would help accelerate the process, he said.\nLowy said many of Westfield America's partners were family concerns or closed-end funds, many of which wanted to cash in their stakes. Closed-end funds must cash in their investments after a certain period.\nSome were also unable to inject the extra capital needed to continually re-develop or expand the shopping malls, Lowy said. \"Some of our partners just do not have the cash, and now they have the option of watering down (their holdings) or selling out,\" Lowy said.\nWestfield had said last year when listing the Australian unit trust vehicle for Centermark, Westfield America Trust, that it planned to list CenterMark in the United States within five years. Lowy said strong U.S. market conditions had led to the earlier than expected listing.\nThe offering is planned for May and is being underwritten by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co, but Lowy said the timing may change if the U.S. market slumps before then.\n\"If conditions change, we'll have to reassess,\" he said.\nWestfield officials said the U.S. listing gave the Australian-based company more flexibility when acquiring shopping malls in the United States, as it opened up access to the U.S. debt markets.\nThe ability to offer U.S. listed shares to shopping mall owners instead of cash would also open up a new range of acquisition opportunities, as many sellers preferred shares to cash for tax reasons, they said.\n", "The global empire of British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp. charged into the vast Spanish-speaking world Friday, leaving them with only Asia to conquer.\nIn a long-expected move, BT confirmed that flagship Spanish telecoms carrier Telefonica de Espana SA would join its Concert alliance, enabling it to pursue the booming Latin American telecommunications market, which is expected to be worth $60 billion by 2000.\nThe deal, which was unwittingly revealed by Concert's newest parter, Portugal Telecom, earlier this week, was seen as a blow to AT&amp;T Corp., BT's arch-rival, and heralds a major change in the telecommunications landscape across the Americas and Europe.\nIn its new deal with Concert, Telefonica is taking a 1 percent stake in BT and BT is taking a 2 percent stake in the Spanish group. Each deal is worth about 280 million pounds ($457 million).\n\"This is good news although it had been expected in the market,\" said Jim McCafferty, an analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.\nWith a fiber-based network that includes a marine link between Spain and Latin America, the companies plan to establish a state-of-the-art communications portfolio offering voice, data, internet/intranet and video stretching from Alaska to South America.\nIn a seemingly inexorable journey across the world, Concert now offers seamless global communications services to customers in 41 countries, focusing on high-margin, multinational corporate customers.\nThe latest deal with Telefonica means that BT, which entered the Spanish market in 1993, aligns itself with a former rival in a key European market.\nInternational telecommunnications groups like Concert are trying to plug holes in their coverage and make up for growth lost in home markets due to increasing competition. But some experts are also stepping up warnings that vast investments abroad might be too risky.\nOne such investment, which has sparked some concern among the analyst community, is BT's proposed $20 billion merger with MCI. The planned deal, which won overwhelming shareholder support Tuesday, is awaiting regulatory clearance in Brussels and the United States.\nBT expects to win final approval for what will be the largest transatlantic merger in history by the fall.\nBT says it is in constant talks with telecoms operators in the last, major gap in global geographic jigsaw -- the lucrative Asia-Pacific region.\nConcert, which needs to service multinational firms with offices in Japan, has been trying to forge a link with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the world's biggest telecommunications group.\nConcert is competing against AT&amp;T-led partnerships such as Unisource and World Partners as well as Global One, an alliance between Deutsche Telekom AG, France Telecom and America's third long-distance carrier, Sprint Corp.\nThe addition of Telefonica came just four days after BT clinched a strategic alliance with Portugal Telecom that opens the door on South America's biggest market, Brazil.\nThe Internacional SA (Tisa) subsidiary will manage a new 50-50 joint venture called Telefonica Panamerica MCI, which will dig deeper into the $36 billion South American continent.\nTisa already dominates Latin America's communications with an empire spanning Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Argentina and is well-placed to take advantage of the continuing privatisation trend in the region.\n", "Embattled Nomura Securities Co Ltd is expected to announce on Thursday the best results among more than 280 brokerages in Japan for the last business year, but prospects for the current year are gloomy.\nAnalysts said on Monday that Nomura's profits for the fiscal year which ended on March 31 should be far ahead of its competitors thanks to huge profits in bond trading and bond underwriting.\nHowever, they added that business for Nomura in the 1997/98 year would be sharply undermined by a scandal, with the size of the expected profit drop depending on how hard the Finance Ministry comes down on Japan's largest brokerage after regulators complete their investigation.\nJapanese prosecutors and securities watchdog are investigating Nomura for suspected illegal deals involving \"sokaiya\" racketeers, who extort money from a company by threatening to disturb shareholders' meetings.\nIn January, Nomura announced pre-tax, parent current profit of 103.69 billion yen ($829 million) for the first nine months of 1996/97, against 91.49 billion yen ($731 million) in actual current profit for the the full 1995/96 year.\n\"Nomura is expected to be the top in earnings in 1996/97 with profits of more than 100 billion yen ($800 million),\" said Ayako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.\nOther analysts said they expect Nomura to post parent current profit -- pre-tax profit which includes gains and losses made on securities investments and other non-operating activities -- of between 120 billion ($952 million) and 140 billion yen ($1.11 billion).\nIn the first nine months, Nomura posted 81.82 billion yen ($654 million) in stock brokering commission against 105.66 billion yen ($845 million) in 1995/96. Net gains on bond trading stood at 66.33 billion yen ($530 million) in the first nine months against 71.54 billion yen ($572 million).\nBut industry sources said they would not be surprised if Nomura posts a loss in the current year because many institutional and corporate investors have suspended their business with Nomura since it revealed on March 6 that two of its directors were involved in the suspected illegal deals.\nNomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it has held since February 1992.\nIf Nomura's market share falls by 10 percent, it will lose 12 billion yen ($96 million) in commissions, analysts said.\nIn addition, Nomura's underwriting business has also been hit by the scandal.\nThe business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported last week that Nomura had underwritten only 2.5 percent of the domestic straight bonds issued so far in April, compared with 14 percent for all of the previous business year.\nThree other big brokerages -- Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, Nikko Securities Co Ltd  8603 T and Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd -- are also scheduled to announce their 1996/97 results later this month.\nAnalysts estimate Yamaichi's parent current profit at nil in 1996/97 against profits of 15.13 billion yen ($121 million) in the profit in 1995/96, and Nikko to have profit of 40 billion yen ($320 million), down from a profit of 65 billion yen ($520 million).\nThey expect Daiwa to post profit of 60 billion yen ($480 million), down slightly from 62.56 billion yen ($500 million).\n", "As Canada's budget deficit shrinks, politicians campaigning ahead of June elections are debating whether to cut taxes or raise government spending.\nWhile many Canadians say they are desperate for tax relief, others are begging politicians to shun tax cuts and spend the extra money on social services.\n\"They have to stop talking about cutting taxes,\" one Toronto social worker said as Reform party leader and tax cut advocate Preston Manning spoke nearby at the kickoff of his campaign for the June 2 election.\n\"People want to hear about jobs and job creation.

Reform has promised to cut payroll taxes and contributions to unemployment insurance, as well as simplify the income tax system.\nIn 1996, the average Canadian family's tax bill was about 48 percent of its income, a study released on Tuesday showed.\nBut the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) opposes tax cuts, saying right-wing platforms are irresponsible. The NDP actually wants to raise corporate and capital gains taxes.\nThe separatist Bloc Quebecois wants Ottawa to close tax loopholes for big business, while giving tax breaks to smaller firms to stimulate growth.\nThe Liberals are sandwiched between the right's call for tax cuts and the left's call for spending, and face different opinions in their own ranks on the issue.\nThey have taken a typical middle-of-the-road approach, advocating tax cuts once the deficit is licked and when health care and education are securely funded.\n\"The choice the other political parties are offering is to declare the job done before it truly is, to introduce a tax cut before the country can afford it,\" Finance Minister Paul Martin told a Montreal news conference on Tuesday.\n\"They would short-change our hopes for a stronger economy and for greater job creation.\"\nMartin said his party would lower taxes but only when the deficit was eliminated. Instead, his party announced on Monday they would not cut C$6 billion (US$4.3 billion) in health care funding, as had been planned.\nMartin has predicted the deficit for the year ended March 31, 1997, would be less than C$16 billion ($11.4 billion), well below the original target of C$24.3 billion ($17.4 billion) for the year.\nBut the Conservatives argue that 87 percent of the deficit decline was due to higher taxes.

A \"decontamination\" period would allow individual cases to be considered and give farmers time to quit farms.\nNo timetable or details of implementation were given.\nCrop analysts expect Ivorian forest protection plans to bite in 5-10 years as World Bank and international pressure grows, but they predict limited action over the next few years.\n\"(The evictions) could be bluff so we do not expect any short-term effect,\" said one, adding that \"illegal\" output was impossible to quantify. \"The (\"illegal\") yield would change each year with tree age and as planters move around.\"\nDonors say protected forest cover has dropped to 3.6 million hectares from 13 million at the time of independence from France in 1960.\nSODEFOR offices in forest areas have displayed copies of the decree near entrances next to local newspaper articles on evictions of farmers and destruction of cocoa trees.\nYao said some farms had been destroyed in increasingly productive forests bordering the large Tai National Park in south-west Ivory Coast near Liberia, but elsewhere the action had been limited.\n\"At Guiglo (western district) and around Tai, it has begun,\" said Yao. \"(SODEFOR) is also replanting along roadsides as a first step to cut down on access to deeper forest areas.\"\nUp-country buyers say a large SODEFOR base north of Ivory Coast's increasingly important cocoa export port at San Pedro has recently been expanded.\n\"People had one-hectare farms or so but then chopped more and more forest down.

Analysts at SBC Warburg cut the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy\", market sources said, and others were cautious on the outlook for the share.\nThe profits were at the lower end of forecasts and included a 29 percent fall in operating profits at BZW to 204 million pounds.\nThe company, which has repurchased over one billion pounds of shares in the last 18 months, said it would return 500 million pounds to shareholders in the next twelve months, and raised its dividend by 21 percent to 31.5 pence, in line with forecasts.\nBut even the buy-back news failed to cheer the market.\n\"The basic message is that there was disappointment about the headline profits and dividend, the mix of profits and the potential size of any buyback,\" said Michael Lever, analyst at HSBC James Capel.\n\"The figures were disappointing relative to expectations and everyone will be pulling their numbers back. I don't think they will make much more in 1997 than they did in 1996.\"\nMarket sources said estimates for Barclays pre-tax profit in 1997 were being trimmed by about 200 million pounds.\nBarclays chief executive Martin Taylor mounted a spirited defence of the results and his strategy at BZW, saying that the UK banking figures were \"cracking\" and that Barclays was investing for the future at BZW.\n\"You have to be careful not to be frightened by your own shadow,\" Taylor told Reuters in an interview. \"The reason that the returns are depressed (at BZW) this year is that we're spending so much.\"\nBZW chief executive Bill Harrison said he plans to improve links between BZW's key areas to build profitable business. He added that the bank's markets division had needed a \"significant upgrade\", but had now been \"re-tooled...and is strongly placed to make a significant earnings contribution.\"\nIn a statement earlier, Barclays admitted underperformance by BZW in the fixed income market, with the exception of sterling, and foreign exchange area.\nTaylor said BZW would continue to incur quite high costs in the first half of the current year and would then face the disruption of moving its offices to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands.\n\"I would hope that the second half would be a lot better,\" he added.\nBZW has had had a turbulent time in the past year which started with the death of its chief executive David Band and has included high-level management shake-ups.\nOn top of this, BZW has also been involved in what have been perceived as some high-profile disasters with its clients. The biggest of these was its takeover defence for Northern Electric against U.S. energy group CE Electric which is being investigated by Britain's Takeover Panel. The late disclosure by BZW of a 250,000 sterling discretionary fee clause meant that CE's offer was extended and it captured Northern by the slimmest of margins.\nBut Taylor said that well-publicised events last year such as the Northern Electric defence had not done BZW damage.\n\"I think Northern Electric showed BZW behaving very energetically to try and prevent a client being taken over and almost succeeding,\" Taylor said. \"We very nearly saved it.\"\nBut the head of quity sales at another investment house said, \"The trials and tribulations at the investment banking arm look as if they will probably be continuing into the next year.\"\nTaylor said Barclays was looking for the best way to return the bank's excess capital to shareholders but rejected the idea of a special dividend, saying that share repurchases help non-sellers to concentrate their position.\nHe noted that earnings per share had risen by 25 percent to 104.2p per share.\nTaylor also rejected the notion that Barclays was devoid of ideas because it wanted to return capital.\nHe said the bank would make acquisitions if they added to shareholder value but could see none on the horizon at the moment.\n", "CardioThoracic Systems Inc is exceeding its internal targets for increasing the number of cardiac surgeries done worldwide using equipment for operating on a beating heart without cracking the chest.\nAt each of 12 centers around the world, surgeons are doing about 11 surgeries per month with the company's new devices, up from none a year ago, said chief executive Richard Ferrari.\n\"We're above our target\" for procedure rates, he said on Monday in an interview with Reuters prior to a presentation to investors here at a Dain Bosworth conference.  \nTo date, more than 200 minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass, or MIDCAB, surgeries using the company's equipment have been performed. Three-quarters of the surgeries have been single blood-vessel grafts, with one-quarter involving multiple-vessel bypasses. The complication rate of one percent is lower than traditional procedures, Ferrari said.  \nThe Cupertino, Calif.-based company is gearing up to train more surgeons to use its equipment. \"If we're doing everything perfectly, we'll graduate 80 surgical teams per quarter,\" Ferrari said, adding he is confident that some Wall Street expectations for CardioThoracic may be met.\nThe company is comfortable with analysts' estimates of 1997 sales reaching about $11 million, versus no revenue this year. \"That is a fair number,\" Ferrari said.\nPiper Jaffray projects sales rising to $50.5 million in 1998 and $108.9 million in 1999.  \nCardioThoracic also is comfortable with analysts' projections of a loss of $1.48 per share this year and a loss of $1.38 per share next year, Ferrari said.\nChief financial officer Steve Van Dick said, \"We'll reach breakeven in mid- to early-1998, with just a slight profit. I don't expect we will end 1997 in the black.\"  \nCapturing even a small part of the 1.9 million heart revascularizations done annually in the United States would make its revenue projections achievable, Ferrari said. Each single-use MIDCAB toolkit is priced at about $2,500. \"For 1997, CTS' projection is 4,000 procedures. In 1998, it's 17,000 and in 1999, it's 50,000,\" he said.\nThe total cost of a MIDCAB procedure is about $15,000 -- less than an open-heart coronary artery bypass graft and equal to or more expensive than some other alternatives.  \nMIDCAB is performed using devices allowing the surgeon to work on a beating heart through small holes in the chest, eliminating the need for the huge incision and cardio-pulmonary bypass circuit that are standard in open-heart surgery.\nLarger companies, such as Medtronic Inc and Genzyme Corp, are moving into the young market for MIDCAB equipment. \"It legitimizes a lot of things we've been saying for a while,\" Ferrari said.  \nWhile larger competitors may pose a competitive threat, Ferrari said CardioThoracic feels secure in its lead in research and development, patent protections and regulatory filings. \"We have much more knowledge about this than they do. We have a huge start ... It's a couple of years,\" he said.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May gave marketing clearance to two of CardioThoracic's five MIDCAB tools -- the access platform and the stabilizer.\nA 510k application for marketing clearance has been filed with the FDA for a distal perfusion device. The company expects to file 510k's for a stitcher and an artery harvester this month, Ferrari said.\nThe company continues to expect to have the entire tool kit approved for more active marketing by early 1997, he said.\nThe company wants to do its own marketing and distribution in the United States, but will seek partners for non-U.S. markets. \"There have been some people who have expressed some preliminary interest in what we're doing,\" he said.\nThe company is seeking European Union marketing approvals. \"We've not focused on the Japanese market yet,\" Ferrari said.\n", "Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said on Monday it expects most of its grounded Airbus Industrie A330-300 aircraft to be back up and running within three weeks.\nThe British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), meanwhile, urged PT Garuda Indonesia to ground its A330-300 fleet, the Civil Aviation Department (DCA) of Hong Kong said.\nCathay's fleet of 11 Airbuses was grounded on Saturday, the day after a Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engine failed on a Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair) flight and forced the plane to make an emergency landing on one engine in the Philippines.\nIt was the fifth time since November that a Cathay Pacific or Dragonair A330-300 had made a single-engine landing. Rolls-Royce said on Friday that gearbox bearings were to blame for the problems with the Trent 700s, which were introduced in March 1995.\nDragonair, owned 25.5 percent by Cathay, has also suspended operations of its fleet of four A330-300 aircraft.\nRoland Fairfield, engineering director for Cathay Pacific, told reporters that Rolls-Royce had proposed a modification to the Trent 700 engine gearbox, which the companies hoped to start incorporating into the Airbus fleet within one week.\n\"We expect the aircraft to commence re-entering service on a progressive basis in approximately one week's time,\" he said.\n\"The rate at which the remainder of the fleet enters service is going to be very much a function of how fast manufacturers can supply modification kits and we can get them embodied into the gearboxes, but I would expect at this stage that from the commencement of re-entry of the aircraft into service, the entire fleet will be back flying within two weeks of that date.\"\nHong Kong's DCA said in a statement that the British CAA call for Garuda to ground its A330-300 fleet had prompted the DCA to tell Garuda that its services to Hong Kong \"should only be operated by aircraft other than\" Trent-powered A330s.\nBut Garuda said earlier it would only ground the airplane if there were an order from the aircraft maker or from the engine maker.\nStressing their primary commitment to safety, Cathay and Dragonair declined to give any indication of costs of the suspension, or its impact on 1997 profits.\n\"Clearly at the appropriate time in the appropriate way we will be discussing these issues,\" said Tony Tyler, director of corporate development.\n\"It is too early to make such comments we are all aware there are regulations covering what we can and cannot say ...stock market regulations ... and at this stage we are not in a position to comment on that particular feature of this issue.\"\nBut analysts expected some erosion of 1997 profits, which some had forecast at HK$4 billion before the suspension. One analyst said the impact would depend largely on how long the fleet remained dormant.\nAnother analyst, Mark Simpson at Schroder Securities, said he was reducing his earnings forecasts for Cathay, but added that Rolls-Royce would almost certainly help defray Cathay's costs and reduce the bottom line impact.\nCathay declined to reveal whether any compensation agreement with Rolls-Royce was under discussion.\n\"We're not in the habit of disclosing the financial arrangements that go on with our suppliers,\" Tyler said.\n", "London-based banking giant HSBC Holdings Plc, will on Monday announce pre-tax profits for 1996 of above 4.6 billion stg, with analysts confident the bank will continue to produce profitable growth.\nIn 1995, pre-tax profits were 3.672 billion and HSBC is expected to raise its dividend to around 40p per share from 32p for the previous year.\nHSBC is the parent of Hongkong Bank, Hang Seng, Britain's Midland and Marine Midland in the U.S.\nAnalysts expect HSBC's margin in its key Hong Kong market to have come under some downside pressure in the second half after a 25 basis points improvement in the first six months.\nBut most expect the overall margin to have been maintained and the bank's Hong Kong mortgage business to have continued to flourish.\nUK Mortgage business is also being pursued aggressively although there may have been some erosion in margin and analysts will be looking to Midland Bank for cuts in its cost income ratio.\nMarine Midland has already reported, weighing in with a 34 percent increase in net income to $380 million for the year.\nOne item that could affect the headline profit figure for the group is the level of realised stock market gains at Hang Seng which could provide a swing of as much as 100 million stg.\nAnalysts do not expect any strategic changes with investment banking continuing to occupy a secondary role and HSBC refusing to be drawn into competing with the large US houses but positioning itself for growth in its Asian core.\nIn terms of capital, HSBC is thought unlikely to perform share repurchases and analysts expect it maintain a progressive dividend policy.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864\n", "U.S. and Chinese negotiators were locked in last-ditch talks into the night on Saturday to try to hammer out a new textile accord and a deal on market access as a new deadline loomed for a cross-Pacific trade war.\nHowever, U.S. officials hinted that an agreement could be virtually in the bag with negotiators expected to work virtually through the night to put the finishing touches to a final text.\nChief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said earlier she was confident of accord on renewing a 1994 textile accord and resolving a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports on the fifth day of talks with officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\n\"We felt like we had made tremendous progress and we are looking to complete negotiations today,\" she told Reuters before leaving for the ministry. \"You're always positive you can reach an agreement but you have to balance it out.\"\nThe United States had extended by a day the deadline of midnight January 31 in Washington (0500 GMT) for agreement on a new textile accord.\n\"I felt like it was important to extend it, the deadline, for one day... so we could get a fresh start this morning,\" Hayes said of the talks that went virtually without a break for 48 hours on Thursday and Friday.\n\"We did not complete the agreement... so we felt like we'd have one extra day to complete it,\" she said before resuming negotiations that dragged late into Saturday without agreement as a new deadline loomed.\nU.S. officials had said they hoped for a deal by the end of Saturday.\nThe Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise. Officials declined to say whether the threatened multi-billion penalties on China would be imposed if the deadline extension expired without accord.\nChinese officials refused to comment, saying only talks were continuing.\nWashington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.\nChina has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.\nHayes said the U.S. side was still focusing on two major demands -- its market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.\n\"The two main things that we have been consistently concerned about are the market access that China has to the United States... and also making sure that it is balanced, that we have a market access package from China,\" she said.\nDisagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier.\nHowever, they said hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement.\nWashington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the previous deadline of January 31, Hayes has said.\nWashington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries.\n", "The number of banks charging non-customers for using their automated teller machines doubled over the past six months, a consumer watchdog group said Tuesday.\nAbout 45 percent of ATMs added the controversial surcharge, on top of the fee most consumers already pay their own banks for using another bank's machine, up from 23 percent in October, according to a survey by U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\nThe non-profit consumer advocacy group also found that the average fee had risen 20 percent to $1.15 from 96 cents.\n\"Banks aren't earning money the old-fashioned way. Instead, they're gouging consumers,\" Edmund Mierzwinski, programme director for the group, told a press conference.\nTwo states, Connecticut and Iowa, have banned the practice of charging non-customers and 12 other states, along with the federal government, are considering similar legislation.\nMierzwinski endorsed those efforts and said consumers should avoid using machines that impose a surcharge.\nThe rise in fees followed a decision one year ago by the two largest ATM networks, Visa's Plus and Mastercard's Cirrus, to lift a prohibition on surcharges.\nBanks defended the practice and said the additional fees helped pay for ATMs in new locations.\n\"The marketplace should decide the prices for ATMs, not the government,\" the American Bankers Association said in a statement. \"Price controls will only inhibit innovation and put a halt to future ATM growth.\"\nBanks added almost 17,000 new ATMs last year, a 13 percent increase, according to a survey by the publication Bank Network News. With surcharges now permitted, \"ATM growth is accelerating,\" editor Don Davis said. \"It's a better business to be in, so more people are getting in.\"\nBig banks were more likely than smaller ones to impose a surcharge, according to the survey. Among the 300 largest banks, 53 percent of ATMs had a fee while only 40 percent of smaller bank ATMs and 6 percent of credit union ATMs charged a fee.\nThat could raise antitrust law implications if large banks banded together to impose fees and drive smaller competitors out of business, Mierzwinski charged. \"Not only are big banks using their monopoly muscle to punish consumers with higer fees, but their strategy is to use the surcharge to hurt small banks and credit unions as well,\" he said.\nCustomers of small banks, which have fewer of their own ATMs, would likely have to pay a surcharge more often.\nBanks say free-market competition is functioning properly. \"Competitions is already keeping ATM pricing in check,\" the ABA said.\nThe consumer group said it surveyed 860 ATMs chosen at random in 27 states and the District of Columbia. The highest rates of surcharging were in the South, with 93 percent of Texas ATMs imposing a surcharge, 95 percent in Georgia, and 88 percent in Viginia and North Carolina, the group said.\n", "Tobacco to insurance group B.A.T Industries Plc reported a five percent rise in 1996 profits to 2.495 billion pounds ($4 billion) on Wednesday, hit by an exceptional charge of 160 million pounds for U.S. environmental claims against its Eagle Star insurance unit.\nExcluding the charge, profit rose by seven percent.\nChairman Lord Cairns said in a statement B.A.T dismissed any liability for damages currently being claimed by smokers in a string of tobacco related lawsuits in the U.S.\nThe company also said it kept an open mind on its corporate structure, but gave no news of any concrete plans.\nAs well as disappointment over the exceptional insuarnce charge some analysts had hoped B.A.T would say more about the possible demerger of its tobacco and insurance arms.\nB.A.T shares, up 32 percent since November as its legal battles in the U.S. looked more promising, tumbled 20 pence to 530 pence in early trade.\n\"We continue to believe that B.A.T Industries itself has no potential liability in any U.S. tobacco litigation,\" Cairns said, adding that the tobacco industry was confident of winning the cases and does not intend to offer a settlement.\nHowever, Cairns said the company would be prepared to \"evaluate proposals from third parties to provide relief from all current and future suits, provided that they were in shareholders' interests\".\nCairns said, \"Our twin goals are to improve the long term growth prospects of our business and to increase shareholder value. We continue to evaluate business oppurtunities and issues of corporate structure that will enable us to meet them.\"\nB.A.T director of public affairs Michael Prideaux told Reuters the company was keeping an open mind. \"We were surprised by media reports that we had ruled out a demerger,\" said Prideaux. \"We are not convinced that simply doing the splits helps either business much, what we are saying however is we have an open mind.\"\nThe company has looked at several options for improving shareholder return over the last year, including merging its financial services arm, comprising mainly general and life insurance companies, with another insurer.\nPrideaux dismissed the idea of floating off the company's U.S. cigarette arm Brown &amp; Williamson as a way of ringfencing the rest of B.A.T from any potential payments to smokers in the United States.\n\"Tobacco is strategically managed as world wide business so simply floating off B&amp;W would be a classic way of destroying shareholder value because B&amp;W plays an integral part in developing U.S. international brands around the world,\" said Prideaux.\n\"If it became independent you would probably end up with separate sales networks.\"\nB.A.T's tobacco business turned in a 7 percent overall improvement in local currency to 1.634 billion pounds with group volumes four percent ahead and world market share increasing to 12.8 percent from 12.4 percent.\nTrading profit from financial services grew by an underlying eight percent to 1.2 billion with strong performances from two insurers Farmers in the U.S. and Allied Dunbar in Britain.\nThe company recommended an eight percent increase in the base dividend to 26.0p, with a further 3.5 pence to be paid as a foreign income dividend.\n($ = 0.619 British Pounds)\n", "AirTouch Communications Inc. agreed on Friday to buy U S West Media Group's cellular phone operations for about $4.5 billion in stock and debt, replacing a complex 1994 agreement between the companies.\nIf the transaction goes through, AirTouch would become the second-largest cellular service provider in the United States -- behind AT&amp;T Corp. -- with 5.3 million customers in 20 states from the West Coast to the Mississippi River.\nThe companies warned, however, that they would call off the acquisition if Congress passes legislation that closes a popular corporate tax loophole.\nUnder the agreement, AirTouch, based in San Francisco, would pay about $2.2 billion in stock and assume $2.2 billion of U S West's debt.\nAirTouch would acquire New Vector, U S West's domestic cellular operation, and U S West's interest in PrimeCo Personal Communications, an advanced wireless joint venture among three Baby Bell regional phone companies.\n\"It's a good move to put the companies together,\" said Charles DiSanza, telecommunications analyst at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.\n\"They've been operating together for a while and already the economies of scale have helped the U S West operations get substantially more profitable.\"\nAirTouch shares rose $1 to $24.50 in midafternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., rose 50 cents to $17.75\nAnalysts said AirTouch would be paying a relatively cheap price for a healthy enterprise.\n\"The markets U S West has -- Seattle, Denver, Salt Lake City -- are some of the fastest growing cellular markets in the country,\" said Mark Lowenstein, analyst at Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston.\nThe U S West acquisition also would give AirTouch a strong regional \"footprint\" against AT&amp;T's cellular business, Lowenstein said.\nAirTouch and U S West agreed to merge their cellular operations back in 1994 in a complex, three-step transaction. But that deal never won much favor from investors because the final value was to be determined by an outside appraisal of U S West's operations.\nFriday's transaction \"eliminates much of the uncertainty investors had about the previous agreement,\" said Kevin Roe, analyst at investment bank ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. \"This one clearly spells out the terms and the timeline.\"\nThe companies could scrap the acquisition, however, if Congress passes legislation introduced Thursday. The bill seeks to bar so-called Morris Trust transactions, which let companies sell chunks of their operations without paying taxes.\nIf the bill passes and regulators apply it to U S West, the companies could consider going back to their original agreement, the companies said.\nCustomers of U S West Media Group's cellular service will not notice any service changes, the companies said. Most of U S West's domestic cellular employees also will become AirTouch employees.

The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., has not yet determined how many it will fire, Harrah said.\nApple dismissed about 1,300 people last year as part of a broad corporate restructuring programme.\nEarlier this month the company said it would launch another restructuring programme aimed at cutting another $400 million in costs. At the time Apple executives said additional layoffs were possible but they provided few details.\nOn Friday, Harrah confirmed layoffs will be part of the plan.\n\"There will be layoffs as part of a larger restructuring,\" Harrah said. \"We are taking a look at the entire business\" including the possibility of discontinuing lines such as the handheld Newton computer and the Pippin home entertainment console.\nAbandoning Newton and Pippin would mark a return to Apple's core business of focusing on traditional PC products rather than other forms of technology. It would also signal a departure from the vision of former Apple Chief Executive John Sculley who pushed for the Newton before he was fired in 1993.\nThe move comes weeks after Apple reported a fiscal first quarter loss of $120 million on a sharp decline in sales. The struggling computer maker recently warned it does not expect to return to profitability until September, six months later than originally scheduled.\nApple's troubles are a setback to Chairman Gilbert Amelio's plan to stanch Apple's losses by 1997. Under his plan, Apple aims to reduce its costs so it can break even at $8 billion in annual sales.\nApple executives have blamed weaker-than-expected sales of the company's consumer-oriented personal computers for the decline in revenues.\nTo bolster sales, Apple on Friday said it cut price cuts on many of its product lines by as much as 27 percent. The company slashed prices of its consumer-oriented Performa machines, its high-end Power Macintoshes and its business-oriented Workgroup Servers.\nFor example, the price of the Power Macintosh 9500/200, a machine popular with graphic artists, was slashed to about $3,200 from $4,200.\n", "Hong Kong's hefty cash reserves offer a comfortable cushion for children born in 1997, the year the British colony returns to Chinese sovereignty.\nAccording to Wednesday's 1997/98 budget figures, thrifty Hong Kong will confront its future as part of China with HK$330 billion (US$42 billion) in total fiscal reserves.\nThat works out to more than US$6,500 for each man, woman and child in the territory.\nBy comparison, gross national debt in the United States of US$5.5 trillion translates into a debt of US$20,500 for every child born there this year.\nBut Financial Secretary Donald Tsang resisted the temptation to hand down a give-away budget.\nInstead of widely-anticipated tax cuts, Tsang's budget speech for 1997/98 (April-March) stressed the need for continuity in 1997, and Hong Kong's ability to work with China to strike a balance.\n\"Fortunately, our healthy public finances and robust economic prospects have made the task of finding the right balance somewhat easier,\" Tsang said.\nBut critics were not satisfied by the government's failure to spend more on the needy, particularly the elderly, while reporting a budget surplus of HK$15.1 billion this year rising to HK$31.7 billion in 1997/98.\n\"I think the size of the surplus is utterly obscene and I'm very, very mad just on that,\" said Emily Lau, an independent Democrat and outspoken critic of the government's social policy.\n\"We are probably the richest place on earth and to think we have several hundred thousand poeple living from hand to mouth.\n\"I've got nothing against the tax reduction on wine, that's fine. But I think we should also do something for the elderly.\"\nTsang cut duties on wine to 60 percent from 90 percent.\nExperts warned that the gap between rich and poor in Hong Kong is bound to widen as impoverished Chinese immigrants flock to Hong Kong seeking streets paved with gold.\nIn 1995, Hong Kong increased the quota for mainland immigrants to 150 a day from 105, mainly for family reunions.\n\"Twenty years ago, Hong Kong could absorb impoverished migrants from the mainland in large numbers because it had an immense need for cheap labour,\" said David Dodwell, a director at Jardine Fleming Holdings.\n\"Today, that is no longer the case. Now our capacity to absorb those in the economy today is much less than it used to be. We don't have the unskilled jobs,\" he said.\nHong Kong's rapid transformation from international manufacturing and industrial hub into a services economy geared to China's economic expansion has caused the relocation of virtually its entire manufacturing base into southern China.\nTsang's highly conservative budget indicated growing awareness of the potential ramifications of mainland immigration, with a 150-percent boost to spending on benefits for newly-arrived mainland children.\n\"As for the children, we help them fit into our schools with special support services and remedial English programmes,\" he said. \"In 1997/98 we will spend a total of around HK$168 million on these children -- an increase of over 150 percent in real terms of 1996/97.\"\n($ = 7.74 HK dollars)\n", "Nomura Securities Co Ltd paid more than 70 million yen ($555,000) via stock deals into accounts linked to a racketeer, the securities firm's former president said on Tuesday.\nHideo Sakamaki, who stepped down from his post last month to take the blame for the payoff scandal, said internal Nomura investigations had discovered a total of five irregular stock deals through which the money was transferred.\nNomura announced on Tuesday that Sakamaki's replacement, Masashi Suzuki, would also resign, along with 15 board members, in a sweeping reshuffle of the company's top management resulting from the scandal.\nSakamaki, who was testifying before a committee of the Upper House of parliament, said that one of the irregular stock deals included a transaction involving more than seven million shares of a commercial bank on March 15, 1993.\nAsked whether it was true that Nomura provided trading profits of more than 70 million yen ($555,000) through five suspected stock deals, Sakamaki said: \"I think the amount is something like that.\"\nIt was the first time a Nomura insider had publicly revealed the amount of money transferred to the racketeer.\nProsecutors and the securities watchdog are investigating Nomura for deals involving the racketeer, or \"sokaiya\". Such racketeers extort money from a company by threatening to disrupt its shareholders' meetings.\nA Japanese news service reported on Tuesday that the Ministry of Finance was likely to suspend some of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as a punishment for the scandal.\nAsked if there were accounts at Nomura linked to other racketeers, Sakamaki said that he believed there were no such accounts.\nHe said that while he believed that only the two directors were involved in the payoffs, he was also responsible himself for causing the scandal as Nomura's top manager.\nHe said that Nomura would work out measures to avoid a recurrence of such a scandal.

Spokesman Jack Daly said the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company hopes to launch a \"national value-price promotion.\"\nPointing to a current promotion on Chicken McNugget sandwiches, which analysts said has helped McDonald's build sales this month, Daly said, \"It's in that same spirit.\"\nCharles Gonzales, a McDonald's franchisee with two units in the San Francisco area, said the nationwide promotion would feature a different sandwich for 55 cents each month when a customer buys french fries and a drink at the regular price.\nThe promotion, he added, is expected to start with the Big Mac hamburger, which is usually priced between $1.90 and $1.99, and will include breakfast sandwiches as well, he said.\nBut the promotion, to be presented to franchisees on Thursday, could spark a price war, analysts said. That prospect worried investors who drove fast-food stocks sharply lower.\n\"Everyone will have something for 55 cents. Now it's a zero-sum game again,\" said Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok.\nBut Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said Wendy's International Inc. and Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, may not match McDonald's price promotions right away.\n\"There are a lot of things (companies can do) to enhance value without directly cutting prices,\" Adelman said, including increasing the frequency of regular promotions.\nEarlier, Burger King said it had no plans to change its prices. Wendy's officials were not immediately available.\nMcDonald's stock tumbled $2.625 to $44.625 and Wendy's slid $1.50 to $20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares were among the most active issues. American shares of Britain's Grand Metropolitan Plc, which owns Burger King, fell $1 to $30.625, also on the NYSE.\nDean Witter's Adelman said it remained to be seen if the McDonald's plan will bring in more customers. \"We have much more jaded consumers today,\" he said, noting price cuts were not \"new news.\"\nGonzales noted some franchisees oppose price promotions since they often do not boost customer traffic enough to offset lower sandwich prices. Moreover, regular customers may be tempted to order whatever sandwich is being offered that month instead of higher-priced menu items, he said.\nDaly, however, said increased sales volume is expected to offset lower menu prices. \"Margins (are) a function of volume,\" he added.\nDick Adams, chairman of the Consortium, an independent association of McDonald's franchisees, said he expected the promotion plan to be approved.\n\"They (franchisees) are going to vote for it,\" Adams said. \"They are being told that it's the only plan that is available.\"\nHe said McDonald's was expected to present the plan in a satellite broadcast to operators across the country on Thursday.\nMcDonald's has been looking to boost domestic sales, which have been pressured because of competition. In a December 1996 memo to owners and operators, Jack Greenberg, chairman of McDonald's U.S.A. said, \"We must re-energise and focus our U.S. marketing efforts and develop a national value proposition.\"\n", "British Biotech Plc moved to reassure its shareholders on Thursday after the surprise resignation of finance director James Noble.\n\"It is a smoooth transition and we believe we have a broad and strong management team,\" chief executive Keith McCullagh said in a telephone interview with Reuters.\n\"We have had a number of talks with our major shareholders and they are very confident about what's happening, as are our two brokers,\" he added.  \nNews of Noble's resignation, as the company prepares to launch its first products, came as a complete surprise to analysts who watch the company closely.\nHowever McCullagh said Noble \"has been considering his future for some time but his decision has only happened this week.\" He denied suggestions of tension at the top of the company, saying \"it is an amicable departure.\"\nMcCullagh praised Noble's contribution to developing the business, which has gone from being a small research operation to stand on the brink of entering the FT-SE 100, saying he had \"raised in excess of 300 million stg for the further development of the business and taken the major responsibility for developing relations with shareholders.\"\nNoble has not yet taken another post, but McCullagh said he was considering a number of opportunities.\nSome analysts believe Noble, who is 37, may want to use his skills in the kind of start-up operation which British Biotech was a few years ago rather than in the large international business it will become if its major drugs, notably cancer treatment Marimastat, succeed.\n\"His interests and skills are in corporate finance and investor relations and the management of that phase of growth. That is what he likes to do,\" McCullagh said.\nHe added that Noble's replacement would be \"a more traditional finance director than we have had in the past.\"\nThe company would be using headhunters to find someone with \"strong international operating experience for a major company which has a range of subsidiaries and which is building revenues and profits.\"\nThe chief executive said the decision on Thursday to name chief accountant and company secretary Anthony Weir as finance director of the group's UK operating subsidiary, British Pharmaceuticals Ltd, was to \"emphasise that our financial management is continuing smoothly and soundly.\"\nHe also took the opportunity to deny a suggestion in the Daily Mail newspaper that British Biotech, which raised 143 million stg in a rights issue last year, could return to the markets for further funding.\n\"We have just under 200 million stg in cash reserves and that is a considerable amount of money,\" said McCullagh, adding that it had sufficient funds to commercialise its lead products.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n", "Stagecoach Plc, the star performer of Britain's transport sector whose shares soared 138 percent in a year, promised on Friday more bumper growth this year fuelled by acquisitions overseas.\nOutlining its strategy for 1997, executive chairman Brian Souter said the Scottish-based buses-to-railways group had not run out of steam and still could deliver growing returns.\nHe also tried to dampen concern about the size of group debt, with total gearing at 567 percent, saying it still had the financial scope to remain a deal-maker.\n\"We are very comfortable about our gearing levels. We would be in a position to make a major European acquisition in the next year if needed,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\nThe fast-growing group is set to target rail and bus firms in the Nordic region as well as examining the Pacific Rim.\nStagecoach, which started as a brother and sister team running the local bus company in Perth, Scotland, is now Britain's biggest transport operator having acquired privatised railway operations in southwest England, a rolling stock company and bus operations in England and Sweden.\nOn buying market share in the British bus market -- Stagecoach has 17 percent with the aim of reaching 25 percent -- Souter said he wanted to wait until the election due by May, which the opposition Labour Party is strongly-placed to win.\n\"We are holding back on these deals because of the prices,\" he said. \"Once the Labour (Party) is in place and we know their policies, then we can move. But for now we have a sabbatical on acquisitions in this area.\"\nOn debt, he said: \"This gearing question is an important one which we want to address with the market.\"\nThe 567 percent gearing includes securitised debt and falls to 197 percent once securitised loans are stripped out.\nStagecoach expects to have 230 million pounds in free cash in two to three years and stressed that 70 percent of its current 830 million ($1.36 billion) of total debt, including securitised loans, was fixed for seven years at 7.19 percent.\nThe Porterbrook UK rolling stock unit could turn in 50 percent of group profit, say analysts, a figure the company does not argue with. \"It has exceeded our initial expectations and we continue to be very happy with it,\" said Souter. \"We are very comfortable with forecasts analysts are making.\"\nSouter said the performance of the shares, which rocketed from 274 pence in December 1995 to the current level of 799-1/2, reflected the quality of underlying earnings.\nStagecoach said it ran all its businesses against a \"worst case scenario\" set of conditions: a market slump, interest rates hiked to 15 percent and an eight percent fall in passenger traffic. Souter said all businesses remained viable.\n\"I'm not saying our business is risk or recession free but these are great quality earnings.\"\n\"Political and regulatory uncertainty are the only worries, but we're not as uncomfortable as we were six months ago.\"\nThere are longer-term concerns about earnings once its South West Trains passenger rail franchise ends in 2003 and the termination of some Porterbrook train leasing deals around the same time.

That would indicate Donald Tsang is not being marginalised as some people were speculating,\" said Bob Broadfoot of the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy.\nBroadfoot was referring to Tung's decision to appoint Tsang chairman of a Land Fund Committee to be established when Hong Kong becomes a Special Administrative Region of China on July 1.\nThe Land Fund's management threatened to turn into something of a political football when Tsang's post-handover status was debated earlier this year.\nA bitter opponent of Tung's proposals to alter Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, Tsang's continued tenure as Financial Secretary after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control in 48 days was considered less than certain.\nTsang was eventually confirmed, but in February, Tung said he was considering changes in the reporting structure at the territory's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\nInstead of reporting to Tsang, Tung suggested that HKMA chief Joseph Yam might report directly to the chief executive, effectively sidelining Tsang.\nBut no changes have been announced. And Tsang's appointment as controller of the Land Fund was interpreted as a sign that changes were unlikely.\n\"That puts him back in the reporting arrangement between Tung and Yam, doesn't it?\" said Broadfoot.\nTung said on Wednesday that the HKMA will manage the fund under Tsang's direction.\nThe Land Fund was established in 1984 to assuage Chinese concern about Britain's intentions. The fund, made up of proceeds from government property sales, now exceeds HK$150 billion -- equivalent to Hong Kong's fiscal reserves.\nHalf of land sales proceeds were remitted directly to the colonial government. The other half was held in escrow in the Land Fund to revert to the post-colonial government.\nThe fund has become so large that its inclusion into the existing reserves, or Exchange Fund, threaten to boost the Hong Kong dollar and put pressure on the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar peg.\nAny change to Hong Kong's independent monetary system could undermine corporate confidence in the territory after the transition, experts said.\nThe status of the territory's top three civil servants is being watched closely in Hong Kong.\nTsang, Chief Secretary Anson Chan and the future secretary for justice are automatic members of Tung's inner cabinet, or Executive Council.\n-- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843-6352\n", "Cigarette makers bargaining with anti-tobacco activists on settling smoking lawsuits have talked little about money and are dwelling on tighter government regulation of tobacco and eliminating sales pitches to youths, sources said Friday.\n\"Less than 5 percent of the time in those rooms was spent on money,\" said one participant in the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe talks -- which began behind closed doors about two weeks ago between top industry executives and an array of anti-tobacco leaders -- are expected to resume Sunday in Chicago, a source familiar with the negotiations said.\nA second session is planned for Monday, with an early break for the Passover holiday. The source said no other talks were planned for next week.\nOne set of key players in the talks, the state attorneys general suing tobacco companies over Medicaid costs, was struggling to coordinate its approach, according to Ed Cafasso, spokesman for Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger.\nIn the United States, Attorneys general are the top legal officials in the individual states.\nWashington politicians and some health groups have objected to some publicized proposals as tepid and a reported $300 billion settlement as too little.\nNews on Wednesday of the talks, a landmark in the 40 years the tobacco industry has steadfastly fought lawsuits and restrictions on its products, still cheered Wall Street.\nInvestors Friday again raised tobacco company stock prices on speculation that a comprehensive litigation and regulatory settlment, even with a price tag as high as $300 billion, was imminent.\nStock in Philip Morris Cos.

Industry analysts generally approve of a settlement, although some say the industry is unlikely to pay as much as $300 billion.\nSeveral attorneys involved in the talks said the prime issues for the attorneys general were winning restrictions on selling cigarettes to people under 18, unambiguous declarations by the cigarette companies on smoking's health risks, and a pledge from the industry to develop safer cigarettes.\n\"The fourth is money,\" said John Hough, an assistant attorney general in Washington state.\n", "Two of Japan's most troubled banks took action on Tuesday to end their long-running financial woes, with one announcing a radical restructuring and the other finding a merger partner.\nThe moves are seen as just the beginning of a drive by the the indebted banking industry to get ready for Japan's emerging \"Big Bang\" era of financial deregulation.\nNippon Credit Bank Ltd, one of three long-term credit banks in Japan, announced that it would cease overseas operations, sell off its Tokyo headquarters as well as other property and write off bad loans totalling 460 billion yen ($3.7 billion).\nHokkaido Takushoku Bank, Japan's 10th-largest commercial bank, meanwhile, said it will merge with the smaller Hokkaido Bank Ltd and cease overseas operations to become a \"super-regional\" bank.\nNCB said the restructuring will boost earnings by 50 billion yen ($403 million) over the next five years. It hopes to gain 67 billion yen ($540 million) from the real estate sales and will also eliminate 600 jobs to cut costs.\nDespite the moves, NCB president Hiroshi Kubota told a news conference that he cannot rule out the possibility of a tie-up or merger with other banks in the future.\nEarlier on Tuesday, NCB put three non-bank financial affiliates under bankruptcy protection.\nAs a long-term credit bank, NCB raises cash through issuing debentures rather than taking deposits.\nThe Japanese government, which has spoken of the benefits of deregulation and leaving the market alone, has taken a strong hand in ensuring that NCB survives, urging other banks to accept newly floated shares to help it rebuild its capital base.\nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) also said it planned to use 80 billion yen ($645 million) from a special fund created to cope with bad loans from the collapse of \"jusen\" housing loan firms.\nFinance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference that the capital increase and disposing of bad loans \"will substantially improve NCB's business foundation and will contribute to the stability of financial systems both at home and abroad\".\nFinancial analysts have criticised the NCB plan, saying it would further weigh down other big banks, which are themselves in far from robust financial health.\nIn addition, some said the moves were too timid.\n\"The restructuring programme announced by Nippon Credit Bank is quite drastic, but when taking into account the size of its massive problem loans, the programme falls short of solving its bad loan woes,\" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc.\nHokkaido Takushoku said it had no choice but to retrench, ending lofty ambitions of being a global player in the banking world.\n\"We made the decision (on the overseas pullout) believing that it was inevitable to ensure leverage in our business while promoting bad loan write-offs,\" it said in a statement.\nHokkaido Takushoku said it and Hokkaido Bank would merge as equals by April 1998.\nBoth are headquartered in Sapporo, the largest city on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.\nThe merger will cut costs at the two banks and mean the elimination of 2,000 jobs.\nIt will also help Hokkaido Takushoku face its mountain of bad debts.

It also reported a former options trader, allegedly Papouis, to financial markets watchdog the SFA.\nOptions are contracts which give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security at a set price on a set date in the future.\nThe SFA said it had been notified of the NatWest probe into the loss and had opened a file while the Bank of England has said it is cooperating with the SFA.\nThe episode was especially embarrassing to NatWest coming only days after it announced its 1996 results.\nOn Thursday, a senior NatWest Markets official said that compared with the size of losses run up from derivatives trading at some other banks, it had got off relatively lightly.\n\"If that is all it costs us to learn the value of a tight infrastructure, then it could turn out to be a blessing in disguise,\" Nick Riley was reported by Britain's Press Association agency as saying.\nRiley is administrative officer for NatWest Markets' global foreign exchange business. His comments were made during a conversation at a charitable function on Thursday night, banking sources said.\nThe PA said Riley had pointed out that other banks such as Barings, which crashed in 1995 owing around $1.4 billion as a result of losses run up by Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson, paid far more to find out that their internal controls were inadequate.\nBut a NatWest spokeswoman distanced the firm from Riley's comments.\n\"He is not a spokesman for NatWest and his comments are not therefore attributable to the company. This was a personal view,\" she told Reuters.\n", "Britain's Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday it had become involved in a probe into alleged irregularities at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, the funds arm of Deutsche Bank's UK-based investment bank.\nA spokeswoman for the SFO said the office was in contact with British investment watchdog IMRO, which would share any relevant material with the office. The SFO investigates and prosecutes major financial crimes in the City of London.\nIMRO's own probe into MGAM has already led to the suspension of two fund managers and briefly saw trading halted in three MGAM funds, which have around 90,000 small investors.\n\"We have been in contact with IMRO. IMRO are investigating and will share anything of relevance with us,\" the SFO spokeswoman told Reuters.\nTrading in the three funds resumed on Thursday after a 180 million pound ($280 million) bail-out by parent company Deutsche Bank.\nSources in both the British banking and fund management industries said the probe appeared to be focusing on links between suspended MGAM fund manager Peter Young and a UK-based broker, Fiba Nordic Securities.\nYoung was not immediately available for comment.\nA spokesman for Fiba Nordic Securities in London said the firm welcomed any investigation and denied any improper relationship with MGAM.\nFiba Nordic Securities has been a broker and valuer for funds managed by MGAM.\nBritish regulatory sources said the UK's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) had previously been examining the activities of Fiba over another matter.\nThis had subsequently led to the investigation by IMRO into MGAM which prompted Young's suspension.\nYoung, whose own assets were frozen as a result of a high court injunction late on Wednesday, was suspended from MGAM on Monday. MGAM announced on Wednesday evening that a second manager, Stewart Armer, had also been suspended.\nYoung had managed two of the three suspended funds.\nMGAM said Armer was suspended on Wednesday evening \"following the discovery of a suspected breach of personal account dealing rules\".\nA source close to the investigation said Armer's assets would not be frozen and he was not a central focus of the probe. Armer was not available for comment.\nBut in Frankfurt a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said neither Young nor Armer had committed an obvious breach of regulations. \"But both were hovering on the brink of a grey area,\" spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf told Reuters.\nAccording to sources close to the investigation, the probe is trying to determine whether the fund's investments in unquoted stocks were valued above their real worth.\nBritish brokers said they had had few redemptions in the three Morgan Grenfell funds after trading in them resumed but the full extent of any exodus would only become apparent after a few weeks.\n\"We are not seeing any panic selling. Redemption levels look modest at this stage,\" an MGAM spokesman told Reuters.\nHowever, banking analysts in Frankfurt said Deutsche had to tighten up internal controls to prevent a repeat crisis at its UK fund management division.\n\"Something like this can never be allowed to happen again. If Deutsche really wants to be a global player in investment banking, then its control mechanisms must keep in step with its growth,\" said Vereinsbank analyst Natalia Grasegger.\nThe fall-out from the MGAM investigation also spread to Sweden, where Young had invested substantially in unlisted stocks. Stocks held in his portfolio fell amid concerns from Swedish officials about the impact of the probe on the country's alternative stock market.

Greenalls has seen improved hotel occupancy and conference business as the corporate sector turned more buoyant and people took more leisure breaks in the year, said Daresbury.\nDe Vere Hotels revenue per available room rose 10.8 percent and occupancy levels were up at 74.4 percent from 72.6 percent.\nThe company's chain of 46 Premier Lodge's increased occupancy levels from 72 percent to 73 percent with revenue per available room up 9.1 percent during the year.\n\"We think that we are seeing a sort of steady pick up in consumer confidence and we consider that to be sustainable for 12 to 18 months,\" said Daresbury.\nGreenalls is also investing to attract the non-traditional pub goer who wants to eat out and is prepared to trade up by buying wine or premium lagers for instance rather than cheaper ales, he said.\nThis strategy should give the company more exposure at the top end of its pub estate to improvements in consumer spending, said Daresbury.\nThe company plans to extend its pub concepts into 292 of its managed estate over the next year and aims to build 10 to 15 new large city-centre pubs.\nIt announced plans to spend 170 million on developing its business in 1997/98 with about 40 million going on rolling out its Greenalls pub concepts.\nGreenalls Inns now operates 920 outlets nationally, of which 514 are managed food houses. Drinks and food sales per outlet in its enlarged managed pub estate, rose 7.8 percent and 11.9 percent respectively.\nGreenalls Inns pub estate was greatly expanded by the acquisition of Boddington in November for 527 million stg.\nOperating margins at Greenalls Inns managed estate were up 1.1 percentage points at 25.7 percent, which reflected changes in the mix of drinks on offer with more wine, premium lager and soft drinks on sale.\nThe company's branded pub restaurants and lodges saw food and drink sales per outlet up by 14.6 percent and 13.8 percent respectively.\nGreenalls' Premier House operates 175 outlets in Britain, including 88 Millers Kitchens, 41 Henry's Tables, 13 Henry's Cafe Bars and seven Quinceys.\nAnalysts expect Greenalls to turn in pre-tax profits of about 168-170 million stg in 1997/98.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437\n", "Western Resources Inc, which has spent much of 1996 laying the groundwork to buy ADT Ltd, is widely expected to sweeten its unsolicited $3.5 billion offer for the electronic security giant.\nIndustry experts said the bid, which values ADT at 22-1/2 per share, is deliberately low and merely reflects an opening salvo in a hostile transaction.\n\"The price is a low-ball price. There is a very good chance this deal will be done at a higher price,\" said Andrew Jeffrey, analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.\nLong considered one of the premier properties in the highly-fragmented electronic security industry, most industry analysts value ADT at significantly more than the Western Resources offer announced earlier Wednesday.\n\"I feel this stock will go to 25 to 30 on earnings in 1997. Anything below that range is not acceptable,\" said Rosario Ilacqua of Rothschild Inc.\nFurthermore, ADT's proposed acquisition by Republic Industries Inc, which collapsed in September, valued the company at about 29 per share. That deal fell apart due uncertainty from Republic's volatile stock price.\nShares of ADT jumped 2-3/4 to 22-7/8 on Wednesday.\nIn a telephone interview, Western president Dave Wittig declined to discuss a potential higher bid, noting only that shares of ADT have appreciated considerably in recent months.\n\"I think that what we're putting on the table is a fair and full price,\" Wittig said.\nWestern Resources has long been considered a potential buyer of ADT, but the company was not yet expected to pursue a transaction. Western holds a 27 percent stake in ADT and earlier this year opposed ADT's proposed transaction with Republic.\nWittig said Western Resources did not pursue an offer for ADT during the Republic deal because it was consumed with its hostile bid for Kansas City Power and Light. That transaction is still not resolved, but Western Resources is holding merger talks with the Kansas utility.\nThe proposed acquisition of ADT also holds problems for Western, which is taking its offer directly to shareholders in an attempt to install its own board of directors. ADT has a poison pill anti-takeover defense that would be triggered if Western bought more shares of ADT.\nWittig said he is hopeful that ADT's management will come to the bargaining table, but noted the company previously was not interested in a business transaction with Western. Wittig said Western executives last spoke with ADT in June.\nWestern Resources has actively expanded its role in the security business as it built its stake in ADT. It has signed six letters of intent to buy security companies this year, including Monday's proposed $368 million acquisition of the security division of Westinghouse Electric Corp.\nAnd last week, Western Resources announced plans to divest its natural gas assets as part of a strategy to focus on its electricity and security businesses.\n\"They've got a lot on their plate, but as far as wanting to run the electronic security business, this is the way to do it,\" Jeffrey said.\nThe electronic security business has grown increasingly attractive to utilities and telecommunications companies in recent months as they prepare to enter new markets that previously were off-limits due to government regulation. The phone companies and utilities hope to add protection to their menu of services and expand their presence in homes and businesses.\n", "China has jailed dozens of dissidents this year amid Beijing's obsession with stability coupled with easing foreign pressure on its human rights record, human rights groups and diplomats said on Wednesday.\nAuthorities have jailed 12 better-known dissidents or sent them to labour camps in the past year, the Hong Kong-based Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.\nAt least 10 lesser-known political activists have been incarcerated in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, Liu Qing, chairman of the New York-based Human Rights in China, said in a telephone interview.\nIn the southwestern city of Guiyang, another seven to eight dissidents have been jailed, Liu said. He declined to elaborate on the cases pending verification of details.\n\"A lot more dissidents were jailed this year than in previous years,\" Liu said. \"There are not many prominent dissidents left.\"\nLiu, who served 10 years in prison for his role in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement and left for the United States in 1992, attributed the tougher policy on dissent to an easing of foreign pressure on China.\n\"International pressure on China's human rights is easing and disappearing,\" he said.\n\"This undoubtedly is tantamount to telling the Chinese Communists that the Chinese government can go all out and persecute dissidents,\" Liu said.\nThe United States delinked human rights from its annual review of renewing Most Favoured Nation trading status for China in 1994. Many business-minded Western governments have been accused of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in China.\nOf the 12 better-known dissidents to be locked up this year, former student leader Wang Dan received the harshest sentence -- 11 years -- for conspiring to subvert the government.\nA Beijing court took just 10 minutes last month to reject an appeal by Wang, a leader of student-led demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nAnother nine dissidents, including Liu Qing's younger brother Liu Nianchun, were ordered to serve up to three years of re-education through labour.\nLabour re-education is an administrative punishment that can be imposed by authorities without recourse to the judiciary.\nWestern human rights activists say re-education through labour is increasingly favoured as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications or publicity of a trial.\nAnother dissident serving time at a labour camp, Chen Longde, jumped from a third-floor window in a suicide attempt in August because he could not tolerate alleged beating by prison guards, family members said. Prison officials deny the charge.\nTwo dissidents fled to the United States this year -- former student leader Liu Gang and veteran dissident Wang Xizhe.\nObsession with stability was another factor in China intensifying its crackdown on dissent, diplomats said.\n\"The government is obsessed with matters of stability at the moment and all the more so because the 15th party congress is around the corner,\" a Western diplomat said, referring to the crucial five-yearly meeting due late next year.\n\"In the eyes of the leadership, dissidents represent a potential threat to stability and social order,\" he said. \"The leadership fears that treating them leniently would only encourage others to challenge the authority of the party.\"\nChina dismisses international criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.\n", "Baxter International Inc is comfortable with the First Call consensus 1997 earnings forecast of $2.36 per share, compared to $2.11 per share for 1996, said Baxter chief financial officer Harry Kraemer.\nIn an interview Thursday with Reuters, Kraemer said, \"We're very comfortable with that. I would say that's a very reasonable number.\"\nHe said the Deerfield, Ill.-based healthcare products giant expects 1997 revenues to be in the $6.5-billion range, up from $5.43 billion reported for 1996.  \n\"If you start off with the $5.5 billion that we have today, you add Immuno for another almost $700 million and you put in a little growth ... it would be fair to say we'd be somewhere in the $6.5 billion range for 1997,\" he said.\nHe said Baxter continues to anticipate closing its $623-million acquisition of Switzerland's Immuno International AG by mid-year.\nThe company expects to post charges on acquired in-process research and development related to buying Immuno and Research Medical Inc, Kraemer reiterated. But he said the size of those charges still has not been determined.  \nHe said closing of the $236-million acquisition of Research Medical is expected by the end of the first quarter.\nResearch Medical's results will not likely have an impact on Baxter's until the second quarter, he added.\n\"Immuno will be non-dilutive in '97 and will be accretive beginning in 1998. For RMI, which obviously is a much smaller transaction, it will be slightly dilutive in 1997 and will be accretive in 1998 and beyond,\" he said.\nBaxter expects gross profit margin to rise this year over last. \"I would expect to see our gross margin increase during 1997 ... as much as a half a point is realistic,\" he said.  \nGross profit margin was 44.6 percent for the quarter just ended, down from 46.2 percent a year earlier. \"The fourth quarter of last year was much higher than our trends.... We just had a blip in the fourth quarter last year,\" he said.\nGross margin for 1996 was 44.7 percent, down from 45.0 percent in 1995. Baxter offset the decline by cutting selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales to 21.0 percent in 1996 from 21.5 percent in 1995, Kraemer said.\nSales in Baxter's renal business grew faster than in the past, in \"low double digits\" on the quarter, and hit $1.3 billion for the year, Kraemer said.  \nThe renal business consists primarily of clinics that sell dialysis services to patients with kidney disease. Baxter's chief competitor in the U.S. market is Fresenius AG.\nIn the United States, fourth-quarter renal sales were down \"in low-single digits, virtually almost flat\" compared to year-ago results, Kraemer said. The decline was less steep than in the third quarter, however, he said, adding there has been an easing in the price war with Fresenius.\n\"There was a significant price competition the first couple of quarters, which has now levelled out,\" he said.\nFor 1996, Baxter's cardiovascular group had sales of $855 million, the biotechnology group had sales of $1.3 billion, and the intravenous systems group had sales of $2 billion.\nLooking ahead, Kraemer said Baxter expects sales to grow more than 20 percent in 1997. \"We think we're going to generate at least an incremental $300-$400 million in cash flow. We will grow our net earnings after tax in the low double-digits. We do believe, beyond 1997, that we'll grow our earnings in 1998 and 1999 in the mid-teens,\" he said.\n((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787))\n", "The stock of International Business Machines Corp. fell in heavy trading on Thursday, hit by renewed fears about its first-quarter earnings after a published report focused on recent analysts' estimate cuts.\nThe sell-off fuelled the overall stock market's fourth sharp sell-off in five days as investors were already scared that Friday's March employment report, if robust, could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again soon.\nIBM fell as low as $128.875 before ending down $2.375 at $131.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the third most-active issue on volume of 4.6 million shares.\nIBM shares began their tumble in London, where investors first read a Wall Street Journal article that said analysts may not be through cutting IBM's earnings estimates.\nThe report talked about a recent spate of analysts' estimate cuts, citing fears that a stronger dollar and a mainframe product transition will hurt IBM's first-quarter earnings, due April 23, and depress the stock even further. A strong dollar makes sales overseas worth less in dollar terms.\nAs previously reported, two weeks ago three Wall Street firms made negative comments and two lowered their estimates on IBM, fuelling a drop in IBM's shares in late March.\nThe report, which appeared as a \"Heard on the Street\" column in Thursday's Journal, also dredged up an almost two-week old rumour that IBM was going to pre-announce that its earnings would come in below analysts' estimates.\n\"The Wall Street Journal article today is a summation of old news,\" said John Jones of Salomon Brothers. \"We talked to IBM today and they have no plans for a pre-announcement.\"\nOne trader said of the newspaper article: \"They are a bit late to the party here.\"\n\"I heard the rumour but I wouldn't put any credence to it,\" said another trader.\nAn IBM spokesman declined to comment on the quarter.\nAs previously reported, on March 21, Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich cut IBM's 1997 earnings estimate to $12.30 a share from $12.50. For all of 1996, IBM earned $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share.\nOn March 20, Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Jay Stevens lowered his first-half earnings estimates for IBM, saying customers might hold off purchases of mainframes until an anticipated upgrade. Some analysts are expecting initial shipments in June.\nStevens added to his estimates for the second half of the year, however, saying the year would be more back-end loaded, as customers make purchases in the second half of the year.\nAlso in March, Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh said it would be tough for IBM's first-quarter earnings, which it estimated at $2.32 a share, to compare to the year-ago period's. The analysts' consensus estimate is $2.31 a share for the first quarter, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.\nFor the first quarter of 1996, IBM posted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $2.48 a share, excluding charges associated with software acquisitions and other special items.\nGary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst, said he is maintaining his first-quarter earnings estimate of $2.32 a share, which he has had since February.\n\"It's going to be tough to make that number and I doubt that they can overachieve it,\" Helmig said. But he added that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed drastically since February, so he sees nothing new to affect his estimates.\nThe IBM drop caused the Dow Jones industrial average to lose 39.66 points to end at 6,477.35 after an initial plunge of more than 80 points.\n", "Regional Baby Bell phone companies appear to have triumphed over their long-distance rivals in a crucial regulatory battle that would leave some customers paying more and others less for their monthly bill.\nThe Federal Communications Commission has decided against ordering a precipitous cut in the $23 billion long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp pay the Bells each year for access to their local phone networks, said FCC and industry officials.  \nBell executives at one point feared such cuts could cost their companies as much as $10 billion in revenues. Consumer groups and long-distance companies more recently advocate immediate cuts in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, saying that would mean a similar cut in long-distance rates.\n\"The Bells have dodged a bullet,\" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group. \"They may get grazed. But they dodged a bullet that was aimed at them during the last six months.\" The rules are set to be voted on next week.\nLess clear is the impact on phone customers.\nThose who make lots of long-distance calls would see a sizeable drop in their bill, said FCC and industry officials.\nBut wireless phone subscribers could pay anywhere from one percent to two percent more a month through new fees. Customers with more than one phone line for a computer or the kids and who make few long-distance calls would see a monthly rate rise of around $1 or more.  \n\"We're cutting away the frills,\" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview. He is a big advocate of the rules under consideration that are expected to be voted on next week.\n\"We're talking about a $1 subsidy per month that we're eliminating for somebody who's connecting a $2,500 computer to that line and purchasing $20 a month of unlimited access,\" Hunt said.\nInstead of a government-imposed cut, the FCC plans to rely on market powers to lower access charges over time, said FCC and industry officials. That could mean an FCC-imposed loss of Bell revenues of no more than $1 billion the first year.\nFCC officials, meanwhile, say the plan would yield a cut in long-distance charges of more than $1 billion in year one.  \nFCC officials are against a steep cut for several reasons.\nCiting rate hikes by AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp late last year, they fear long-distance carriers may not fully pass on the cut to consumers and pocket some of the money. Long-distance executives vow to pass on the cuts.\nFCC officials also fear a sharp cut would unleash a rise in local phone rates by carriers trying to recoup lost money.\n\"We're keeping basic residential dial tone at today's price,\" said Hundt.\nCritics charge the plan -- which could still change before next week -- would mean higher rates. AT&amp;T says long-distance customers will see a $1.5 billion jump at the outset in July.\n\"Regulators appear unlikely to squeeze the fat out of the Bells' prices, leaving consumers paying for inflated rates,\" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union.\nBut Hundt says that over the next five years at least $10 billion \"will be transferred to consumers\" via access cuts.\nThe plan also would pay for $3 billion to connect schools, libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet and provide cheap phone service for the poor.  \nAccess charges were created after the 1984 breakup of Ma Bell. Experts agree the $23 billion is more than the cost of providing access to the local phone network. But they cannot agree on the amount.\nFCC officials said 85 percent of the nation's 80 million residential phone customers would see a lower monthly bill.\nThose who make lots of long-distance calls would benefit the most, because the agency plans to replace some of the existing per-minute access charges with a monthly flat rate.\nThe 15 percent of residents who do not make long-distance calls would see their bills stay the same. The monthly flat rate \"subscriber line charge\" customers pay to the local phone company is likely to remain $3.50.\nBut customers with more than one line and who make few long-distance calls are likely to see a rate rise.\nThat's because the ceiling, or cap, on the subscriber line charge is expected to rise to $5 a month from $3.50 for each additional residential line, and to roughly $7 a line for multi-line business customers from $6 a month.\nOne possible way around the charge may be for customers to list their additional lines in a different name or use another local carrier, said industry officials.  \nMeanwhile, large businesses or consumers who make a lot of long-distance calls could well see a drop in their phone bill because the FCC plans to lower the permanent access charge to about two cents a minute from about 5.4 cents.\nTo make up the lost revenues, the FCC plans to require long-distance carriers to pay local carriers a new monthly \"pre-subscribed line charge\" for each long-distance customer.\nThe charge -- which will range from 75 cents a month for single-line residents to $4.50 a month a line for multi-line businesses -- are intended to better reflect the actual costs of using the local phone network.\n", "The possibility that landing fees at Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok (CLK) airport could be the highest in the world are a matter of concern for the International Air Transport Association (IATA), its director general Pierre Jeanniot said on Tuesday.\nHe told Reuters that he hoped the increases in fees over those at the existing Kai Tak airport would be reasonable and would \"consider the economic impact on both airlines and Hong Kong\".\nJeanniot was speaking following a speech to the Hong Kong International Aerospace Forum which included key representatives from the territory's Airport Authority.\nLast week, Hong Kong IATA representative Gilbert Chow said new research showed that fees at CLK, which is due to open in April 1998, could be up to four times higher than at Kai Tak.\nIf confirmed this would bring landing fees to around US$12,000 for a Boeing 747, industry sources said.\nThe research was based on revenue forecasts and the expected numbers of flights in and out of CLK, extracted from the business plan suuplied to IATA by the Airport Authority, Chow added.\nThe Authority has repeatedly said charges for landing and aircraft parking will not be announced until next year after full consultations with the airlines.\n\"They may be higher than existing charges but it is premature to speculate on their level. The Authority is committed to completing and operating a cost-effective airport according to prudent commercial principles,\" an airport statement said.\nLater on Tuesday, IATA's director of corporate communications, William Gaillard, who was accompanying Jeanniot, said Hong Kong could become the most expensive airport in the world and a quadrupling of fees was \"obviously crazy.\"\n\"We appeal to the Authority to be reasonable when they come to setting the new fees. The damage that could be done is tremendous. We realise there may be an increase but it should be gradual and by a small amount,\" Gaillard told Reuters.\nHong Kong's Civil Aviation Department said current landing fees for a Boeing 747 are about US$3,000. IATA said the most expensive landing fee is currently US$9,000 at Japan's Kansai airport.\nHong Kong IATA representative Gilbert Chow, who is also station manager for Northwest Airlines, said he would like to be proved wrong by the authority.\nA meeting due to be held this week with authority executives has been postponed. The next meeting is due to be held in February, Chow said.\n\"This is a major concern to us and we are making the appeal -- don't hit us from day one. The airline business is very competitive but on the other hand it brings a lot of economic benefit to the entire territory. If the increase is so dramatic, then airlines will not be able to cope and the increase wil have to be passed onto the consumer,\" Chow told Reuters.\nIndustry sources said the Airport Authority, under pressure to recoup massive construction costs, is also under increasing pressure from a growing lobby of airlines which see future profit margins under threat from higher fees.\nThere have already been previous warnings about fees doubling which have alarmed airline groups including the Orient Airlines Association.\nOne of the main users of the new airport, Cathay Pacific Airways Limited also recently voiced its alarm and warned that Hong Kong's economy risked being damaged if airport fees were set too high.\n- Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017\n", "Russia, expecting an increased grain harvest but lower carryover stocks this year, is unlikely to go on a shopping spree soon despite government talk of imports, industry sources said on Friday.\n\"Soy and maize buying is a real possibility for Russia, but I wouldn't start to talk about any volumes,\" said Arkady Zlochevsky, head of the OGO commodities trading company. But he said he had been buying some Brazilian and Argentine soymeal.\nFarm Minister Viktor Khlystun has said Russia may import 4.0-4.5 million tonnes of maize and soymeal plus 500,000 tonnes of food wheat to supplement the 1996 harvest and a very low carryover from last year.\nWhile other grain sources also talk big numbers, they say Russia's grain needs do not always mean imports will take place.\n\"They do not yet have sufficient information to interpret their grain needs,\" said a senior Western grains source, referring to Khlystun's figures.\nRussian 1996 net grain harvest predictions range from 69 to 75 million tonnes.\nSources say Khlystun has not approached major Western grains exporters in Moscow about any possible buys.\n\"He hasn't come to us,\" said one Western grains source.\nOthers say Khlystun, who gave no specific time-frame for possible buying, may be waiting for international prices to slip on the back of better harvests around the world.\n\"No, no -- no buying right now,\" said Andrei Ambartsumyan of grain trader Exportkhleb. \"But in January, when domestic maize prices could peak, who knows?\"\nBut Eduard Baranov, deputy head of the Centre for Economic Trends, an institute set up by the government, said Russia could be a buyer as it had used most of the carryover from 1995.\n\"Khlystun's (import) numbers are probably close to the truth,\" said Baranov, whose centre sees net grain output at 69 million tonnes, below official forecasts of 75 million tonnes but still above last year's drought-hit 63.4 million.\nThe Western source said Russia's total grain imports last year, with flour converted to grain equivalent and pasta buying included, were 5.5 million tonnes.\n\"The cash and the need are there,\" said a Canadian source, \"but the (Russian) government will not fund the whole amount.\"\nThe source said many small, private Russian traders had turned to Canadian agriculture officials but that no big requests had come from the state or from former state buying agencies like Roskhleboprodukt.\nAndrei Sizov of private agricultural consultancy SovEcon Ltd said he thought Russia's total imports of all types of grain from all sources over the 1996/97 crop year could be six to seven million tonnes, including 3.5-4.0 million tonnes of wheat and wheat flour, 1.5 million tonnes of barley, 200,000-300,000 tonnes of rye and 300,000 tonnes of rice.\nBut doubts remain. \"I've got a lot of interest and requests from the Russian side, but it's hard to say how legitimate it all is,\" the Canadian source said.\n--Moscow Newsroom +7095 941 8520\n", "Canadian mining companies are keeping a wary eye on the strengthening Canadian dollar, which threatens to bruise their earnings and cash flow.\n\"As the Canadian dollar strengthens, it hurts us,\" said Vic Wells, spokesman for Anvil Range Mining Corp., which cited the stronger currency as a factor that forced the company to suspend zinc and lead mining at its Faro property in Canada's Yukon last December.\nAnalysts are forecasting a surge in the Canadian currency in 1997, with some predicting the unit to rise to 80 U.S. cents from its current 74 U.S. cent range.\n\"It'll take the cream off, that's for sure,\" said George Miller, president of the Mining Association of Canada.\nCanada is the world's largest producer of potash, uranium and zinc, the world's second-biggest producer of nickel after Russia and an important source of copper.\nCompanies that produce metal mainly in Canada are especially hit by the currency strengthening against the U.S. dollar because producers must pay their operating costs in Canadian dollars. But most companies' revenues come in U.S. dollars, the currency in which most metals trade.\n\"Currency gets full-time attention here,\" said Alan Thomas, chief financial officer of Noranda Inc..\nA change of one U.S. cent in the Canadian dollar translates into C$20 million ($14.8 million) on Noranda's bottom line, Thomas said. The currency rose about three-quarters of a U.S. cent in 1996, costing Noranda about C$15 million ($11.1 million), he said.\n\"So for '96, there's not a big change. But if the dollar continues to go up, it will have a bigger effect,\" he said.\n\"All our costs are in Canadian dollars -- the salaries we pay, the supplies we buy, the rent we pay. All our products are priced in U.S. dollars and they're priced the same regardless of the exchange rate,\" Thomas said.\nCompanies such as Alcan Aluminium Ltd., with most production outside Canada, are not as exposed to harm from a stronger currency since they pay most of their operating costs in U.S. dollars, analysts said.\nBut for companies such as Inco Ltd. and Falconbridge Ltd., which produce most of their nickel in Canada, a stronger dollar will take its toll.\nFalconbridge figures a one-cent change in the Canadian dollar would knock C$7 million ($5.2 million) off its bottom line, even with the company's substantial currency hedging programme.\nWhile Falconbridge operations in the Dominican Republic and Norway would not be affected by a stronger Canadian currency, about two-thirds of the company's operating costs originate in Canada, said Chief Financial Officer Lars-Eric Johansson.\nInco estimated that every one-cent change in the Canadian dollar amounted to a $9 million pre-tax hit despite currency hedging. But the company earned $179 million in 1996 on revenues of $3.1 billion, so small movements in the Canadian dollar do not have a huge effect, said Inco Chief Financial Officer Tony Munday.\n\"It's not going to kill us,\" he said.\nStill, some mining analysts said the effects of a stronger Canadian dollar must be understood in context.\n\"With a rising dollar, it usually means metal prices are going up as well,\" said base metal analyst David Davidson with CIBC Wood Gundy in Toronto.\n", "The BBC announced \"historic\" plans to break into the domestic commercial television market on Monday, linking up with British satellite cable broadcaster Flextech Plc to offer up to eight new pay television channels.\nFlextech, majority-owned by America's biggest cable television group Tele-Communications International Inc, is contributing 22 million pounds ($35.2 million) of equity and can make 118 million pounds in credit facilities available to the ventures.\nFlextech and BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm, announced in September an agreement to form a joint venture to create a series of mainly digital subscription television channels in Britain, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Irish Republic.\nAfter months of negotiations, the two companies announced that, subject to shareholder approval, they planned to form two joint ventures which will combine the BBC's diverse archive, scheduling and production skills with Flextech's multi-channel television management and marketing knowledge.\nThe principal deal will be to develop and launch, mainly in digital format, a number of new pay-television channels in Britain.\nThe second is to buy out and develop in analogue and, in due course, in digital formats what is currently UK Gold, one of the most successful channels transmitted by one of British Sky Broadcasting 's multi-channel packages.\n\"The joint ventures with the BBC represent a major opportunity for the long term development of Flextech and the consoldiation of its position in the multi-channel television market in the UK,\" Flextech's chief executive Roger Luard said.\nDubbed Horizons, Style, Learning, Arena, Showcase, Sports Entertainment Network, One-TV and Catch-up TV, the eight planned channels include documentaries, consumer, educational and arts programmes, drama, comedy, sport, music and high profile programmes to be aired shortly after first transmission on BBC1 and BBC2.\nUnder terms of its licence, the BBC has to show its programmes first for free to domestic British audiences who fund the corporation though television licences.\n\"These channels will have widespread appeal and will, we believe, play an important role in the future growth and development of multi-channel television,\" Luard said.\nFlextech and the BBC confirmed that they would give the first option for the transmission of up to five of the digital channels to British satellite operator BSkyB 's consortium.\nBSkyB has linked up with Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc to form British Digital Broadcasting in a bid for licences to operate up to three domestic \"multiplexes\", multi-channel digital frequencies.\nFlextech, which simultaneously reported flat annual pretax, pre-exceptional losses of 16.8 million pounds, said that to buy out pay-TV channels UK Gold and UK Living, it would issue 34.95 million shares to media groups Pearson, America's Cox Communications Group and BBC Worldwide.\nThe deal is worth about 269.9 million pounds and values UK Gold at about 210.1 million pounds and UK Living at 104 million pounds.\nIn return, Cox, Pearson and BBC Worldwide will take a 13.3 percent, 5.6 percent and 3.5 percent stake respectively in Flextech.\nAfter buying the 75 percent equity share capital of UK Gold and 68.75 percent UK Living, that it does not already own, Flextech will then sell on the 65 percent share capital of UK Gold for 87.75 million pounds.\nOn completion of the deals, Flextech will own 50 percent of the equity share capital of each joint venture and 100 percent of UK Living.\nTele-Communications International Inc (TINTA), meanwhile, has agreed to offer its financial muscle to the main deal.\nThe U.S. group will fulfil Flextech's financial obligations to the principal joint venture \"in certain circumstances\" if Flextech fails to do so.\nTINTA's subsidiary UAEH owns 50.9 percent of the voting rights in Flextech, representing 46.5 percent of the group's issued share capital.\nAfter completion of two joint ventures with BBC Worldwide and following the share issue to Cox, Pearson and BBC Worldwide, UAEH will hold 36.1 percent of Flextech's shares.\nIn order to preserve its majority voting rights, UAEH will be granted a special voting share.\n($ = 0.624 British Pounds)\n", "Live Picture Inc., the California photography software company headed by former Apple Computer Inc. Chief Executive John Sculley, will on Monday launch its first photo imaging product for consumers.\nThe product, called LivePix, will be available in retail stores for under $100 and will enable home personal computer users to stretch or enhance pictures, stick on disguises or drag and drop them into other digital photos for printing.\nThe product is also available through the LivePix home page at http://www.livepix.com.\nSculley, who joined the Soquel, Calif.-based firm as president and chief executive in January, said in an interview that the technology for the first time enables individuals and families to use professional-quality digital picture editing techniques on their own home computers.\n\"We think that PC photography is really going to be one of the exciting emerging markets,\" said Sculley, whose company has minority equity investment from such industry heavyweights Eastman Kodak Co. and Broderbund Software.\nThe technology allows people to add special effects, such as changing colouring, skewing images or distoring them, and to compose graphics such as greeting cards and calendars which incorporate pictures and text.\nLivePix, like the company's Live Picture product for professionals, uses FlashPix technology the company pioneered to allow speedy, high resolution photo viewing and printing.\nInstead of moving the tiny pixels used to create computer monitor images about, a task Sculley describes as taking \"an excruciating long time to move on the screen\" FlashPix uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to speed processing.\nWhile Sculley noted that older technology could take a half an hour or more to move rotate and manipulate a photographic image, or requires movement of low grade images to improve speed, FlashPix moves pictures rapidly.\nThis is one feature which is expected to help speed adaptation in the market of digital editing technology.\nAlthough digital cameras remain expensive -- at around $350 to $800 for entry-level models -- and image quality for these is still below that of film cameras, the industry expects consumers to take advantage of the increasing availability of services which will digitize film images.\nSculley said Live Picture has also been working with other industry leaders, such as Hewlett-Packard Co. which is a dominant force in computer printing technology, to develop and expand a market which is now in its embroyonic stages.\nSculley noted that three are more than 60 billion photographs taken every year, but only some 2 percent of those are ever duplicated or used again, providing a wide-open market for people to add new, digitally-enhanced flourishes.\n\"What we really want to do in the early stages is to establish the foundation,\" said Sculley, who predicted the market would really begin to heat up in the build up to Christmas 1997 a year from now. \"The technology is here now.\"\nSculley compares the advance and the consumer market potential with that of electronic publishing in the 1980s, when several major software companies such as Aldus and Adobe, which have since merged, thrived by significantly lowering the cost and ease of professional graphics.\nHe also said the concentration of major high tech firms on the Internet will provide enormous new market potential.\nThis week, for example, Live Picture has scheduled a briefing in conjunction with Hewlett-Packard, Eastman Kodak, Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.to discuss further plans for using its technology to publish and distribute photographic images on the Internet.\nSculley said people will be able to include photographs in documents and send them in electronic mail.\n\"What makes this technology different from anything that's come before is it is totally open, it's available and has huge advantages in sending photos over the Internet,\" Sculley said.\nMicrosoft is expected to introduce a product in the same general area soon, also using FlashPix technology, according to industry executives, and Sculley said competition would only help define and expand the market at this stage.\n\"What we really want to do is see FlashPix become the standard and see it grow,\" said Sculley, adding that Live Picture wrote most of the original technology behind it.\nSculley, who left Apple in 1993 and served briefly as chief executive of Spectrum Information Technologies Inc. before a financial scandal surfaced at the small company, also has a New York-based venture capital business.\nIn January, Sculley announced he had joined privately-held Live Picture, and had bought a piece of the company. He has declined to detail his holding, although he said holdings by key executives of Live Picture exceed that of the corporate investors.\n", "Russian demand for imported sugar has picked up earlier than usual on the eve of the beet harvest, and traders said less price volatility and more consolidation were adding stability to the domestic market.\n\"Demand is normal, prices are stabilising,\" said a senior trade source. \"There's sugar coming into the ports and demand is good.\"\nHe said raws would need to arrive by mid-July to be processed at domestic refineries before the Russian beet crop supplanted them as a feedstock.\n\"The (Russian) market is strong at the moment,\" said a second senior trade source. \"You are seeing demand for sugar at the moment. There is some pretty intensive importing of raws right now -- the price structures make tolling profitable.\"\nTraders debated market talk of sugar backlogs at the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk and whether Russia could soak up any unplaced cargoes looking for homes.\n\"If you have raws arriving in the Black Sea in July, you'll be pressed,\" said the first source, adding that refineries needed 14-21 days for processing and that they would be less keen to contract for raws as the beet harvest approached.\nRecent market talk that around 250,000 tonnes of raws, possibly Brazilian, could be expected later this summer in Novorossiisk or the Baltics was still speculative, traders said.\nA Novorossiisk port source said that a backlog of Cuban raws at the outlet had edged down only slightly to 80,700 tonnes from around 90,000 tonnes last week because the Russian receiver was not ready to take delivery.\nHe said the port expected to receive around 200,000 tonnes of raws, probably of Cuban origin, this summer, including 70,000 tonnes of unknown origin before June.\nIndian refined white sugar stocks in port warehouses were around 400,000 tonnes, the port source said, but the senior trade sources said it was overblown by a factor of ten or more.\nRussia is heading into its traditional jam-making season, a major factor that spurs a rise in refined sugar imports.\n\"People are preempting a little, because demand doesn't normally pick up until end-June,\" said the first trade source, adding, \"the high-quality sugar market is much stronger -- you're seeing significant demand, especially at the Western (beverage) bottlers (with Russia operations).\"\nSources said domestic sugar reserves were being drawn down but that a fundamental, long-term pick-up in consumer demand had yet to materialise. Some traders see Russian demand as fairly price inelastic and relatively steady despite economic decline and tight disposable income.\nRussian consumption is about five million tonnes a year.\nThere is less room for European sugar in Russia, which meets most of its needs by importing whites from Ukraine and refining Cuban raws and its own sugar beets.\nBut the structure of the Russian market is changing.\n\"The market is consolidating -- it's a natural market development,\" said the first source, adding that the days of suppliers having to leap over three or four middlemen to get to buyers were gone.\n\"You're getting directly at the refiners, and you're cutting out the wild (price) swings,\" he said.\nA big glut in 1995, in which buyers imported too much and demand failed to take off as hoped, forced changes in distribution networks that were now consolidating the market.\n\"The domestic market will remain strong but it won't go crazy,\" said the first trader. \"But hopefully this will establish a pattern.\"\n--Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520\n", "More than 250 Chinese citizens have called on Beijing's top military leaders to take tough action in a dispute with Tokyo over a group of islands in the East China Sea, a petition organiser said on Sunday.\nBeijing should send Chinese forces to the disputed Diaoyu Islands, known in Japan as the Senkakus, to destroy a makeshift lighthouse built there by a right-wing Japanese group in July, organiser Tong Zeng said in a telephone interview.\n\"We are calling for troops to be sent to get rid of the Japanese lighthouse,\" Tong said. \"Japan has violated our territorial integrity...we are very angry.\"\nThe rare petition was addressed to Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and chairman of the Central State Military Commission, and to other top military leaders. It had been signed by 257 ordinary citizens, Tong said.\nPetitioners included officials, retired servicemen, workers and students, he said.\nTong is a leading anti-Japanese campaigner in China whose high-profile approach led authorities to confiscate his passport and order him to leave Beijing temporarily during last year's 50th anniversary of the Japanese surrender.\nBeijing and its arch-rival, Chinese Nationalist-ruled Taipei, both claim the Diaoyu Islands, which are located about 300 km (190 miles) west of Okinawa and 200 km (125 miles) east of Taiwan.\nTokyo says the uninhabited group has always been part of Japan.\nThe dispute over the islands' ownership flared in July after the Nihon Seinen-sha (Japan Youth Federation) moved to buttress Japan's claims by building an aluminium lighthouse on one of them, prompting howls of protest from China's state media.\n\"The Chinese side must take strong and concrete action to protect our nation's territorial integrity,\" the Chinese petitioners wrote in their appeal to Beijing.\nThe military should immediately remove the five-metre (16-ft) Japanese lighthouse, or at least should send warships to protect any Taiwanese or Hong Kong groups who attempted to destroy it, they said.\nWhile China's Communist Party-controlled media quickly condemns any perceived signs of resurgent Japanese militarism, Beijing has in the past suppressed unofficial protests against Tokyo and campaigns for Japanese compensation for war victims.\nPetitions to parliament judged hostile to the government have often prompted the detention of signatories, but Tong said the Diaoyu petition was a private move by ordinary people that would be welcomed by the Beijing leadership.\n\"There is nothing wrong with this action, this is to protect China,\" he said. \"I think the government could not but welcome it.\"\n", "China was silent on Tuesday on the fragile health of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping after Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and other leaders cut short out-of-town trips to visit the ailing patriarch.\nThe State Council, or cabinet, declined on Tuesday to make immediate comment on the rumours that the health of Deng, 92, had deteriorated recently or that he had suffered a stroke.\nIn Taipei, Taiwan's top policymaker on mainland affairs described Deng's condition as serious and said the government would closely watch developments.\nParty chief Jiang, who is also state president and head of the army, returned at the weekend, cutting short an unpublicised visit to the communist revolutionary base of Ganzhou in central Jiangxi province, said one Chinese source close to the party.\nPremier Li Peng also flew back to Beijing at the weekend, abruptly curtailing a tour of the booming southern province of Guangdong because of Deng's deteriorating health, said the source, who asked not to be identified.\nThe two leaders had returned to Beijing where they visited Deng, the source said.\nDeng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded compound behind the Forbidden City of China's emperors in central Beijing.\nDiplomats have said one barometer of Deng's health in China's highly-secretive system is the travel of top leaders and close family members, with few willing to be out of town or abroad if Deng were close to death.\nVice-Premier Li Lanqing was abroad on a visit to Israel and Iran, and Defence Minister Chi Haotian was in the Philippines, where officials said he would not change his travel plans.\nChinese sources have reported increasing rumours in Beijing in the past few days that Deng's health may be failing.\nHowever, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week Deng was all right for a man of his age.\nHong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper reported at the weekend that the architect of China's sweeping economic reforms had been rushed to hospital on Thursday after a massive stroke that followed an earlier, mild stroke.\nDoctors said that if Deng's stroke had been a haemorrhage he could have died within hours, while if it was a thrombosis, or formation of a blood clot, he could last days or weeks.\nRumours about Deng's health surface periodically and one such rumour caused Hong Kong stocks to tumble last Friday.\nThe worries over Deng's health deflated Taiwan's main stock index by 1.161 percent to 7563.76 on Tuesday morning while Hong Kong's major index slipped 0.80 percent to 13039.03.\nDeng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival when he appeared frail and faltering on a visit to Shanghai. He is now believed to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity.\nChina's elderly leaders exert great influence after their retirement in a society where age is revered and in a communist system in which officials spend years building up a power base.\nDeng retired from his last official position in 1990 and his only post is honorary chairman of China's Bridge Association, a title that reflects his passion for the card game.\nDeng was in the public eye at the start of the new year when state television ran a 12-part documentary on his life, but without details of his present circumstances or interviews with his wife or children.\nWestern diplomats say the longer Deng lingers the less impact his death will have on the delicate balance of power at the top of China's ruling Communist Party.\n", "Britain and China on Tuesday agreed to let Chinese troops into Hong Kong ahead of its return to China, but the accord was marred by a looming quarrel over residency rights after the handover.\nHong Kong, a British colony of more than 150 years, will become a Special Administrative Region under China on July 1.\nThe fight over residency rights, or \"right of abode\", is of concern to 750,000 Hong Kong people who have obtained foreign citizenship and now are unsure if they also will have the right to live permanently in Hong Kong after the handover.\nLast week, future leader Tung Chee-hwa proposed measures to curb protests in the territory and bar political parties from receiving overseas donations after July 1.\nWith 77 days to go before China regains soverignty over Hong Kong, fewer people in the territory of 6.4 million say they are finding reasons to celebrate.\nIn a telephone poll for the daily South China Morning Post, 57 percent of 586 people surveyed last week said they would be happy on June 30, a drop of nine percentage points compared with a similar survey in February.\nThose who said they were saddened by the sovereignty change rose to 17 percent from 11 percent. The English-language daily said it was the first decline in good feelings about the handover since August last year.\nOn Monday, Beijing announced rules on who would qualify for the \"right of abode\" in Hong Kong after July 1.\nBritain quickly accused China of going it alone on an issue that should have been settled in diplomatic talks.\nBeijing further angered Britain by saying it would send the residency bill to the provisional legislature it has appointed to replace the elected Legislative Council on July 1, and not to the current lawmaking body.\n\"It's our domestic affair. We don't need the British to tell us who is a Chinese national,\" reports from Beijing quoted China's top Hong Kong policy official Lu Ping as saying.\nFirmly contradicting Britain, Lu said the issue had never been on the agenda of Sino-British diplomatic negotiations on the details of the sovereignty transfer.\nMore trouble appears to lay ahead over the issue.\nGovernment-funded Radio Television Hong Kong reported on Tuesday that the British-led Hong Kong government will not extend any help to China, potentially jamming further talks.\n\"The government said it won't cooperate with China in drafting of right of abode legislation if it is put to the provisional legislature before the handover,\" it reported.\nBut on Tuesday, the Hong Kong government suddenly announced a breakthrough accord over the stationing of an advance party of 40 Chinese soldiers in the territory ahead of the handover, ending months of deadlock over the unit's size and role.\n\"They (PLA soldiers) will not be armed and will not enjoy any special legal status or...privileges and immunities,\" a government spokesman said.\nHugh Davies, a chief British representative in a joint Sino-British group handling Hong Kong's handover, said more Chinese troops would move in over the next few months.\n\"We haven't got a timetable, we are still talking to the Chinese side about future numbers, but clearly within the next two and a half months, that's not a great deal of time, we would expect some more to arrive shortly before the arrival of the main body of the People's Liberation Army,\" he told reporters.\nThe PLA advance guard will prepare the facilities for the PLA garrison due to take over defence duties from the British army's \"Black Watch\" regiment on July 1. The PLA garrison might eventually be up to 10,000-strong, military sources say.\n", "Regulators will host an auction Tuesday that supporters promise will usher in a new breed of nationwide radio service but critics charge may cost U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars in lost revenue.\nUp for grabs are two licenses to provide radio programming that will be beamed coast-to-coast via satellite. Digital radio will offer listeners CD-quality sound and specialised programming that can be tuned in anywhere in the nation.\n\"Americans will be able to travel anywhere in the country, including remote rural areas where radio reception is poor, and enjoy the same high-quality audio and wide selection of programmes the entire trip,\" said William Caldwell, president of Seattle-based Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corp., one of the bidders at the Federal Communications Commission sale.\nThe FCC resolved a long-standing dispute among its four commissioners in early March by limiting the auction to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital radio.\nTwo of the commissioners -- Chairman Reed Hundt and Susan Ness -- favoured opening the sale to any company wanting to bid. But in the end they agreed reluctantly to limit the auction so the launch of digital radio would not be delayed further.\n\"The decision to keep the auction door closed may needlessly cost the public millions of dollars,\" Hundt said when the agency announced its decision.\nHundt said that if other companies value the digital radio airwaves but are \"arbitrarily excluded from the auction, it is safe to predict that the auction winners will simply sell their licenses to those companies.\"\nAside from DBSC, the other three bidders are: CD Radio Inc. of Washington, D.C.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston, Va.; and Primosphere LP of New York.\nCommissioner Rachelle Chong contended that opening the bidding would have been unfair to the four.\n\"These applicants have been ready and willing to move forward for some time. The have expended considerable rsources in developing this technology,\" she said, adding that the first application was filed seven years ago.\nDigital radio is unlikely to be on the air for at least three years -- if not longer -- owing to the time it takes to get satellites built and deployed into orbit.\nThe service will probably be subscription-based, with an expected cost of about $10 a month. Listeners will have to buy a special radio receiver that will cost about $200, on top of the price of a regular radio.\nThe credit-card sized satellite antenna could be installed in cars, trucks and homes.\nIf it wins a license, DBSC plans to deliver regional programming throughout the country. It would offer, among other things, children's programming, foreign-language, classical music, opera, all-news, all-sport and educational programmes to targeted demographic groups.\nThe programming would be offered as an advertising-supported service and as a commercial-free subscription service.\n", "The Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents (HAFFA) is to raise some of its freight charges from January 1, HAFFA chairman Sam Chung has told Reuters.\nBut he said the majority of rates, including handling and documentation, terminal charges and attendance fees will not increase.\n\"HAFFA's goal is to keep freight costs down in order to maintain Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading air freight centre. We raised tariffs this year only on essential, mainly labour intensive items.

But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted.\nRubin outlined two possible approaches. Under one approach, some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded.\nUnder a second approach, no mixing would be allowed with banks but, as currently permitted, thrifts would be allowed to combine with  commercial firms.\nIf banks are allowed to mix with commercial firms, the reforms could take effect two years after enactment, Rubin said. If mixing is not allowed, the reforms could take effect in nine months.\nThe Federal Reserve should continue to oversee bank holding companies, while specific activities would be overseen by specific regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators.\nBanks would be allowed to underwrite municipal revenue bonds.

They want decision times cut and better coordination between mining and other ministries.  \n\"What the Minister of Finance and what the Minister of Mines says are two different things,\" Philippe Palanque, managing director of Ivory Coast's largest mine, SMI (Societe des Mines d'Ity), which is prospecting around its existing site.\n\"Administrative decisions are sometimes taken all the way up to the Prime Minister,\" said another exploration geologist.  \nIvory Coast's annual gold output of less than three tonnes a year is dwarfed by mining giant Ghana's annual output of 40 tonnes. Recent finds in Mali are set to at least double national production to over 10 tonnes, but underlying Birimian greenstone geology is similar throughout the sub-region.\n\"Ivory Cost had no mining experience like Ghana, so development has been slow while Mali and Burkina have raced ahead in the 1990's,\" Joe Hinzer, General Manager at Ivory Coast's other gold mine SOMIAF (Societe Miniere d'Afema) told Reuters.  \n\"Ivory Coast has good potential but discoveries like Ghana and Mali follow no rhyme or reason,\" said one geologist, adding that a find of one million ounces would be seen as good.\nSMI opened in 1990 and was privatised last year. It predicts a gold production, by leaching ores with cyanide, of 1,523 kilos in 1996/97 after ouptut of 1,276 last year.\nSOMIAF says its production is set to jump to 935 kilos against 565 last year and has started feasibility studies for expanding operations in the next three years.  \nNewcomers are undeterrred by small gold ouptut, pointing to geological potential, infrastructure, and political stability.\n\"(The mining code) is not a star example but it works. There are some pretty good tax exemptions,\" says Peter Pelly, geologist for South Africa-based Gencor which, with other firms, has joined a gold rush to West Africa.\nExploration companies are given a customs duty waiver on imports but they say red tape delays securing the exemption.\nState participation in projects has waned however, with mining develpment arm SODEMI a candidate for privatisation.  \n\"In the last year since the mining act a lot of companies have gone straight into ventures without Sodemi,\" says Gencor.\nMining firms arriving in Ivory Coast in the early 1990's are still tied into joint-ventures but benefit from 30 years of mapping and prospection by SODEMI.\n\"Sodemi is improving as it gains more experience but at one stage we almost pulled out as the goal posts kept changing,\" said one geologist, citing problems over board representation.  \nOther mining and investment laws give the state a free ride of 10 percent of mining profits but allow firms to repatriate funds and dividends.\nTaxes are now levied at three percent of turnover rather than profits, while tax breaks apply for mining investments of 500 million CFA or more.\nProcessing time for permits of up to 1000 square km, valid for three years but renewable twice for two years, was slashed from over a year to a few weeks.  \n\"The fiscal regime is also better but there needs to be more work on banking and accounts as well as uniform implementation of different mining code provisions,\" said one mine manager.\nIvorian officials say relaxation of unwritten gold sales rules are being considered. Gold from SMI is currently marketed at spot rates through West Africa's central bank, (BCEAO).\n\"We are paid the going gold rate but payments are often delayed,\" says Planque. \"We cannot raise loans against the gold or stabilise profits on the futures market,\"  \nSMI, which is planning to open a new gold mine as part of a French (BRGM) and Australian (Normandy Mining) group, La Source, also wants clearer rules on illegal mining at its proposed site.\n\"At the moment there are too many, over 5,000, artisanal miners from Liberia, Guinea and Mali,\" says Palanque.\n-- Abidjan newsroom, = 225 21 90 90\n", "Hong Kong's finance chief Donald Tsang on Wednesday hammered home a message of fiscal independence when he presented the last budget under British rule, even though he had China breathing down his neck.\nThe Financial Secretary hailed cooperation with Beijing, which helped draft the budget that will straddle Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1.\nBut he peppered his speech with reminders -- to listeners in the territory's Legislative Council that China plans to dissolve this year -- that Hong Kong will remain financially independent of Beijing.\nTsang stressed that China had chiselled this autonomy in stone in the Basic Law, which will be Hong Kong's constitution after the sovereignty change.\nMany in Hong Kong have worried that China will try to milk Hong Kong of its wealth, but Beijing has said it will not remove a cent in taxes from the territory.\n\"It's so obvious that Hong Kong will be worth more to China as a going concern than for a one-off raid on the pot of gold,\" said an analyst with a major securities house.\nThe Basic Law says the territory will maintain independent finances, manage its own economic policy and keep free trade.\n\"These articles have a clear message. The resources of Hong Kong are to be managed separately and independently -- they are to be used exclusively for the benefit of Hong Kong people,\" Tsang said in his speech.\n\"Financial and monetary affairs shall be determined exclusively by Hong Kong law...trade and investment shall continue to enjoy freedom of movement and freedom of markets.\"\nBecause the budget for the year starting April 1 straddles the handover at midnight on June 30, it was crafted jointly with Beijing through the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group responsible for settling handover details.\nBut there will be no repeat. Beijing had stated that from July 1, preparation of Hong Kong budgets would be Hong Kong's business alone, Tsang emphasised.\n\"He seemed very keen to remind China of all those things, and I think he is very right to do so,\" said pro-democracy legislator Emily Lau, a strong critic of China's communist leadership.\nDuring budget negotiations a Chinese negotiator, Chen Zuo'er, complained that Hong Kong's spending was speeding out of control, like a racing car.\nLau told Reuters: \"I'm quite sure everybody knows there has been a lot of pressure on him (Tsang) and on the government with all these public scoldings by Chinese officials about the racing car running out of control and killing everybody.\"\nThe budget that was agreed was moderate on the expenditure side and China appeared pleased with it.\nBut some analysts said Tsang's speech highlighted concerns that China might meddle in Hong Kong's economy.\n\"He tries to assure Hong Kong the autonomy of the government has not been affected, but the reality is that the budgetary autonomy of the Hong Kong government has been affected in the negotiations,\" said political analyst Sunny Loh.\nAnother analyst at a fund management house said there were doubts about how long China would allow Tsang to stay in his job after a recent speech in which he warned that China's plans to slash civil liberties could scare away investors.\n", "Bagel sales continue to heat up as more restaurants open across the United States, but the number of companies that will be doing most of the baking is expected to narrow.\n\"It's a consolidating category,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Howard Penney.\nFor now, much of that consolidation in the $2.3 billion industry will involve smaller, regional chains being acquired by the larger, publicly traded firms.\nLater on, access to capital is expected to be a key factor in determining which players emerge as dominant, analysts said. That competition appears to favor, in particular, the No. 2 chain, Einstein/Noah Bagel Corp..\n\"If you were to handicap the race to supremacy on that factor alone (access to capital), it would be hard not to arrive at the conclusion that Einstein is going to be the dominant chain,\" Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok said.\nEinstein/Noah Bagels currently has more than 315 stores in 27 states and the District of Columbia.\n\"We're now No. 2 in bagels but expect to be No. 1 by the end of 1997,\" said Einstein spokesman Gary Gerdemann, adding the company planned to open 300 to 350 stores this year.\nBruegger's Bagel Bakeries, a unit of Quality Dining Inc., now ranks No. 1 with 450 units in 37 states. It plans to open a \"triple-digit number\" of new stores this year, said Chris Romoser, a spokesman for Bruegger's. He did not give an exact figure.\n\"The category is growing by leaps and bounds,\" Romoser said. \"We believe there is a lot more room for growth.\"\nJack Grumet, chairman of Manhattan Bagel Co., a chain of about 300 units, said much of that growth comes as small, independent units are gobbled up by the larger players.\n\"We see a lot of consolidation,\" Grumet said. \"There's a lot of fear in the minds of the smaller guys with two, four, six, eight stores\" as the large chains survey their markets.\nHe added that Manhattan Bagel, which plans to add 120 to 160 units this year through franchisees or area developers, gets offers from independents to purchase their stores.\nThe expanding industry reflects America's growing appetite for bagels, which date back to the late 17th century.\nSales in 1996 were an estimated $2.3 billion, up from $1.6 billion in 1995 and only $429 million in 1993, according to the Independent Bakers Association, citing industry figures.\n\"It's really a substitute for bread and for doughnuts,\" said Michael Evans, chairman of BAB Holdings Inc., which operates Big Apple Bagels.\nEvans said BAB hopes open 70 to 80 units this year, expanding its network of 162 stores.\nBagel sales include products sold in grocery stores, which in the aggregate are still the leading outlet. To tap into the popularity of the bagel, breakfast cereal giant Kellogg Co. last year bought Lender's Bagels, a line of frozen grocery store bagels.\nEateries that bake fresh bagels, however, say they do not compete with the grocery stores.\n\"They are two separate outlets,\" Evans said, adding consumers often acquire a taste for bagels at the grocery store and then discover hot-from-the-oven products at restaurant chains.\n\"Lender's has done us a great favor,\" Evans said. \"It has educated the consumer...\"\n", "Quaker Oats Co.

Sales of its six-flavor Diet Snapple line, however, rose 23 percent in 1996.\nChicago-based Quaker said it earned $18.1 million, or 12 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $47.8 million, or 36 cents a share, in the 1995 period. Excluding a $40.8 million pretax restructuring charge in the 1995 fourth quarter, Quaker posted a year-ago operating loss 18 cents a share.\nFourth quarter revenues were $1.06 billion, down 10 percent from $1.18 billion a year earlier, which included $90.3 million from divested businesses.\nFor the full year, Quaker said it earned $244 million, or $1.80 a share, which included a $113.4 million gain on divested business. In 1995, it earned $720 million, or $5.39 per share, with a $1.05 billion gain.\nSales last year were $5.20 billion, 13 percent below the previous year's $5.95 billion, which included $796.9 million from divested businesses.\n\"This was a rebound year in which our largest, value-driving businesses -- U.S. and Canadian foods and worldwide Gatorade -- increased their operating profits,\" Chairman William Smithburg said in a statement.\nA $100 million cutback in advertising and marketing costs in 1996 also helped results, analysts added.\nIn a conference call, Smithburg said Quaker was committed to at least 10 percent real earnings growth in 1997. \"We're going to try like crazy to do even better than that,\" he said.\nQuaker management again pledged to turn around Snapple, which it bought over two years ago for $1.8 billion.\n\"We need to stabilise (Snapple's) volume\" in 1997, Smithburg said. \"Our goal is to operate Snapple at cash positive in 1997.\"\nCash positive means Snapple is expected to be profitable, excluding goodwill charges of about $50 million a year.\nQuaker surprised some analysts by not taking a charge in the fourth quarter to reduce Snapple's value. Analysts had expected Quaker to take a large writedown for Snapple, potentially as high as $1 billion.\nSmithburg declined to comment on speculation and rumours that Quaker was looking to sell Snapple, a fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business, and its Gatorade sports drink.\nHe said Quaker's management continues to review steps to \"create value for shareholders,\" but declined to be specific.\nGatorade, Quaker's largest brand, had a strong year in 1996, Smithburg said, with sales volume rising 6 percent in the fourth quarter and 4 percent year-to-date.\nGatorade is launching this year a \"Frost\" line of Gatorade beverages that will feature a \"cooling taste,\" Smithburg said. \"The trade acceptance has been nothing short of terrific.\"\nSmithburg said the company's hot cereals business had a strong year, with sales volume up 9 percent.\nReady-to-eat cereals, such as Cap'n Crunch and Life, gained 3 percent in volume for 1996.

Mid-crop prospects are expected to be clearer by mid-March as pod counters complete tallies.\nLate mid-crop volumes depend partly on rains up to April.\n\"Normally we get a bit more rain in early March but they are a bit late,\" said the weather centre spokesman. \"If dry weather continues until the end of the month trees might be over-stressed but some stress is normal for this time of year.\"\nA crop analyst said, \"There is some yellowing of leaves which we usually see in January, but I am not worried.\"\nOthers returning from growing areas said drizzle had fallen in southern regions with isolated thunderstorms.\n\"There was not much rain but we are still optimistic that levels will increase soon,\" one said. \"My figures show average rainfall of 20 mm for February against (an average) 54 mm.\"\nLate 1996 rains and a mild January harmattan wind meant the effects of drought in February had not been as harsh as might otherwise have been the case, said crop analaysts.\nOn some eastern cocoa and coffee plantations, fires that had been started to clear undergrowth had got out of control.\n\"There has been some damage to badly maintained plantations but on farms we usually visit the fire swept through undergrowth in a flash and did not affect trees,\" said one crop analyst.\n\"Overall, there doesn't appear to have been much serious damage at all,\" he said. \"It sounds worse than it is, although some coffee farms were burnt to the ground.\"\nData from the 10 national weather stations showed the following total rainfall for the last eight days of February in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days in brackets)-\nDalao 2.7 mm (0), Gagnoa 20.2 mm (0), San Pedro 12.6 mm (0.1), Tabou 21 mm (0.1) and Man 2.0 mm (0), Dimbokro 32.3 (0), Yamoussoukro 0 mm (0), Abidjan 8.9 mm (2.7), Sassandra 8.8 mm (0), Adiake 13.9 mm (10.3), Korhogo 0 mm (0).\nRains fell in Abidjan on Monday and Tuesday as skies remained overcast.\n-- Matthew Bunce, Abidjan Newsroom +225 21 90 90\n", "Colombia prepared on Sunday for the start of a nationwide strike on Tuesday that promises to be the largest in 20 years, according to labor leaders and the security forces.\nTalks between union chiefs and government ministers aimed at averting the stoppage by more than 800,000 state workers broke down in the early hours on Sunday.\nState workers were demanding a 21.5 percent pay hike, compared to the weighted 13.5 percent government pay offer, and were protesting at what they say are the whittling away of labor rights and government plans for the privatization of state-run industries.\nThe government issued a communique on Sunday saying: \"The salary demands far exceed the government's current financial capacity ... The suspension of national and regional privatization processes would affect the improvement of efficiency of public services.\"\nThe unions began drawing up last minute plans for the nationwide shutdown that could paralyze all but essential public services.\nThe police and armed forces, meanwhile, announced beefed-up security measures to curb radical protest and what they say is the possibility of leftist guerrilla attacks, timed to coincide with the industrial action.\nA police spokesman said roadside checkpoints would be set up across the country and at key entry points to the capital.

The cane harvest continues and the factories are flush with processed sugar.\nBreakeven point for the factories, which process cane into coarse granulated white sugar, is around 4,000 yuan a tonne.\nTraders in China and Hong Kong polled by Reuters said no movement in prices could be expected just before the new year, when the entire country closes down.\n\"The Spring Festival is very long and holidays are anything from a week to a month in some places, so the market will not change,\" another Chinese trader said.\nGuangdong and neighbouring Guangxi are China's principal sugar-producing provinces. Total sugar production for the current season is expected to be 6.6 million tonnes.\nThe cane harvest ends in late March and crushing will continue until around May, after which prices traditionally begin to strengthen.\nChina's annual sugar demand has been put at eight million tonnes.\nOne industry executive in Australia told Reuters that with the industry having told itself Chinese demand will hit 14 million tonnes a year by 2005, maybe it is time to look at why demand has remained constant for the past few years.\n\"The (Beijing) government is able to control the industry in terms of what comes in, what goes out and to a large extent to influence prices through official procurement channels,\" he said from Sydney.\n\"So maybe it is time to ask if it is also the case that the government controls demand,\" he said. \"China is not like India, where the government would fall if there is no sugar to put in the tea.\"\nOther trading sources have said that as sugar is not an integral part of the Chinese diet, it is a flexible commodity. People will buy it when it is available and won't miss it when it is not.\nFactories were not immediately concerning themselves with government pronouncements that domestically produced sugar would be procured for central reserves in order to shore up prices, traders said.\nNor was there any concern about imports as nothing was expected to arrive in China before the middle of the year.\nThe central government said it would permit sugar imports of 690,000 tonnes, which would include tonnage imported under barter deals with Cuba.\nBut traders and producers around the region have said they expect China to import at least 1.5 million tonnes of sugar in 1997.\n", "Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc will soon own Chef Boyardee, Polaner fruit spreads and PAM cooking spray, but the leveraged buy-out firm still has a big appetite for food companies.\nThe Dallas-based group, which announced on Friday a $1.3 billion acquisition of American Home Products Corp's food unit, plans to buy two Mexican food firms this year and does not intend to stop there, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hicks told Reuters in a telephone interview.  \n\"Our plan is to use this as a platform,\" he said of the American Home Products deal, the biggest ever for Hicks Muse. \"We intend to start with this and grow both internally and through additional acquisitions of branded products.\"\nSeven-year-old Hicks Muse has been digesting food businesses for several years. It bought dairy firm Morningstar Group in 1991 and took the company public in 1992.\nIn March it bought Ghirardelli Chocolate Co from Boston buy-out specialist Thomas Lee.\nIt also owns Campfire marshmallows and Angela Marie's.  \n\"We like established brands because we think they offer the most ability of cash flow and long-term growth potential,\" Hicks said.\nHe said his firm had been searching for a large food acquisition and was alerted to the American Home Products food business about six months ago. Most Wall Street analysts had expected the unit to be bought by another food company.\nThe devotion to the food industry by Hicks Muse comes as U.S. food companies undergo major cost-cutting and restructuring programs due to the maturation of key products and intense competition for supermarket shelf space.  \nOn Thursday Campbell Soup Co unveiled a plan to repurchase stock, cut jobs and expand overseas in an effort to boost profits in the mature industry. And Nabisco Holdings Corp announced in June that it would cut 4,200 jobs as part of a cost-cutting program.\nHicks said the buy-out firm will finalize plans to integrate American Home Products's food business by the time the deal closes in 60 to 90 days.\n\"We have a vision of what we are going to do,\" Hicks said, but declined to be specific.  \nOne of Hicks's savviest investments was in the 1980s when he and fellow Dallas investor Robert Haas built a beverage powerhouse through acquisitions of soda brands A&amp;W, Seven-Up, Dr. Pepper and Squirt.\nBut the Hicks Muse group ran into trouble with its 1994 $390 million purchase of G. Heileman Brewing Co, maker of Lone Star beer and other brands. In July it sold the brewer to Stroh Brewery Co for an estimated $275-$300 million.\nOther Hicks Muse investments include radio stations and a foam company.\n", "3Com Corp Chairman Eric Benhamou said he plans to use the company's proposed merger with U.S. Robotics Corp to expand the reach of 3Com's office-oriented equipment into small business and home markets.\nIn a telephone interview Wednesday evening after the announcement of the $7.3-billion-merger (on a fully-diluted basis), Benhamou said a key force behind the deal was the prospect of enlarging the market for its corporate network equipment into retail sales channels.\nAs the leading supplier of modems, U.S. Robotics' strong presence in retail outlets can be used to propel sales of 3Com's core network adapter card business, he said.\n3Com is by far the world's dominant supplier of adapters, or network interface cards (NICs), used to link personal computers to networks.\n\"Our OfficeConnect product line is perfect for the retail market,\" Benhamou said, referring to products it introduced in 1996 that repackage its other corporate office equipment -- hubs, switches and routers -- for small business and home users.\nOfficeConnect products link the computers, printers, modems and telephones found in home offices in a low-cost network.  \nBenhamou also sees opportunities to sell U.S. Robotics modem products for desktop and laptop computers to corporate offices using 3Com's 500-strong enterprise sales force.\n\"We will just leverage Robotics strength in retail outlets,\" he said in reference to his plan to shoe horn 3Com equipment into consumer markets that -- until the recent demand explosion for Internet links -- was largely confined to office networks.\n\"(The new demand for network connections) even reaches into your shirt pocket with products like Pilot,\" he said. Pilot, a product 3Com will acquire in the merger, is a shirt-pocket sized personal information organizer that offers ties to the Internet.\nFurther growth will come from Robotics efforts to develop higher speed modems like the 56 kilobit ones it introduced on Monday and future cable modem and digital subscriber line modems that transit up to six megabits per second.\nHe said the merger would also give 3Com access to a growing base of telco carrier customers who use Robotics hubs equipment to provide Internet dial-up services, saving 3Com from having to invest on its own to enter the Wide Area Network (WAN) market.  \nRobotics focuses heavily on WANs, providing equipment for both ends of an Internet connection: modems for consumers and hub connections for service providers. Fifty percent of its revenue come from modems, a third from hub equipment and about 20 percent from sales of Pilot and miscellaneous products.\n\"As far as technology is concerned, we are very focused on LANs,\" Benhamou said, contrasting his company's traditional focus on local area networks (LAN) found in corporate offices.\nOf 3Com's $2.3 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues, 40 percent came from network adapter cards and 60 percent from sales of hubs, switches and routers systems, largely to corporations.\n\"We only have about one to two percent overlap in terms of product revenues,\" Benhamou said of the two companies.\n-- New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736\n", "Britain could raise between 600 million and 1.5 billion pounds ($960 million to $2.4 billion) in net proceeds from the sale of the London Underground rail network, Steven Norris, a former transport minister now working on the Conservative Party election manifesto, said on Wednesday.\nNorris, who is spearheading the ruling party's election campaign for London and the south-east of England, told Reuters he also believed the government is strongly examining the option of fare and service standard controls for the tube network.\nIn a telephone interview, Norris, who has been involved informally with government studies into a possible sale of the network, known as the tube, said he understood the sale proceeds figure excluded the cost of funding necessary investments.\nThe gross proceeds figure was put at between 1.4 billion and 2.5 billion pounds, he said. In the run up to Britain's general election, which must be held by May 22, London Underground has been turned into a \"political football\", government sources say.\nAs politicians among the ruling Conservatives and also the opposition Labour party believe that Londoners' votes may ride on the tube in more ways than one, there is great pressure on the government to submit a compelling case to the public.\nNorris said he believed the government was also looking at a way of safeguarding service levels, much as the Department of Transport has already done with the national rail network.\nA government source also told Reuters earlier that fare controls were on the cards under sell-off plans -- a crucial tactic for commuters who are likely to fear that higher fares would otherwise follow from privatisation.\n\"The key selling point of (national overground) rail privatisation to consumers was provision of fare controls and the need to maintain existing levels of service,\" the source told Reuters. \"So it is unlikely that those would not be maintained under the London Underground sale.\"\nThe government source concluded, \"In a pre-election situation the government has to have reasons to do it which are presentable in the public eye.\"\nThe comments came the day after opposition Labour leader Tony Blair, ahead in electoral opinion polls, said he was committed to keeping the tube in public hands and revitalising it through private sector investment.\nNorris slammed Labour's plans to encourage private sector investment into the tube to maintain track, signalling, tunnels and for new trains as inadequate.\nHe said private finance projects in the underground worth 1.0 billion pounds were already underway.\nThe sale options being looked at by the government include a full scale sale, or selling the franchises to run individual tube lines, he said.\nThis is seen as a feasible route because the network currently runs each line as a separate business, with its own fleet of rolling stock. But Norris said franchises would have to be long enough to allow franchisees to recoup necessary investment in the network.\nThe network, some of which is more than a hundred years old, built in the Victorian era, faces a government budget freeze of 500 million pounds per annum in the next financial year.\nThat government subsidy will be slashed to 350 million in the year after and 150 million for the year after that.\nA spokesman for the Department of Transport said the shortfall should be filled by an expected increase in the system's operating surplus (or profit) which is currently at 100 million pounds and seen growing up to 300 million.\n($1=.6237 Pound)\n", "Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s. said on Thursday it had agreed with Czech steelmaker Trinecke Zelezarny a.s. to cooperate in steel production and privatisation projects.\nSkoda said the deal would help make the ailing Czech steel industry more efficient through coordinating the modernisation of production in complementary areas.\nSkoda, which makes heavy iron finished and semi-finished goods, said in a statement from its headquarters in Plzen that both companies would specialise and coordinate in unspecified areas of production, aiming to cut costs.\nSkoda's spokesman Karel Samec said selected products would be manufactured in the cheaper of the two mills.\n\"This scheme will also be used in the future in other companies,\" Samec said in a statement. \"Cooperation and... participation in privatisation is necessary, bearing in mind the current stagnation of the steel production in the world.\"\nSamec declined to specify which privatisation projects Skoda had under consideration.\nThe Industry and Trade Ministry plans to sell 19 percent stakes of the 67 percent it holds in two other steel firms -- Nova Hut a.s. and Vitkovice a.s.\nThe plan has yet to be approved by the full cabinet.\nTrinecke Zelezarny, one of the four biggest steelmills located in the northeastern town of Trinec, was partially privatised through a direct sale of a 51 percent stake to a domestic investment group and the government's voucher scheme.\nA steel industry source told Reuters on Thursday that Skoda, which has rapidly acquiried companies in the post-Communist era, was also considering acquiring the troubled Poldi Ocel steel mill west of Prague.\nSkoda's Samec told Reuters he \"was not aware\" of any plans that would lead to Skoda acquisitions in Nova Hut or Vitkovice, and that \"it was too early to talk about other projects\".\nThe government in 1993 agreed to sell a controlling stake in Poldi to the small Czech company, Bohemia Art which has never fully paid for its majority interest.\nProduction in Poldi came to a halt earlier this year because the company was not able to pay its energy bills.\nSkoda was involved in inconclusive talks earlier this year on bailing out Poldi. Bankruptcy cases against Poldi are slowly moving through the courts.\nSkoda, based in the western city of Plzen, makes everything from drink cans to trolleybuses and nuclear components and has shown a large appetite for acquisitions.

But, shortly after that, merger activity began swiftly for other, non-public navigation services.\nSome industry executives and venture investors are already seeing a similar phenomenon in other areas. With the cool state of the market for initial public offerings, many companies are expected to seek corporate investment or buyouts.\nMany have shifted their business plans to the corporate market in an effort to win corporate information technology dollars. Partly, this is also due to a view that public Internet access will not speed up any time soon.\n\"There's no panacea in the bandwidth area,\" said Intel Corp. executive Victor Varney, using the industry term for the speed of an Internet connection. Varney noted that an independent survey projects that by the year 2000 fewer than 20 percent of individuals will have speedier connections than a common phone line.\nOne example of overcrowding in an Internet business sector is the category of \"push computing\" where more than two dozen companies are competing, including Net software heavyweights Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.\nMany industry executives expect Microsoft and Netscape will turn push technology -- the automatic delivery of customized information over the Internet to computer users -- into a commodity market, leaving room for only a few providers.\nVenture capitalists see this as an example of a broader shake-out in the Internet business.\n\"I think we're still deeply into the settling-out period,\" Onset Venture's Winter said.\n\"Is push going to be a business? It may turn out to be a technology like AI (artificial intelligence),\" rather than a full-blown business, he said.\nThe pace of the initial public offering (IPO) market for Internet start-ups was at its most frantic last spring when some companies gained $1 billion initial market valuations despite little promise of sustainable profits.\nAt the time, investment bankers joked you could write \"Internet\" on a dollar bill and they could take it public for $10, but no longer.\n\"Within six months 'Internet' is going to be a nasty word to use in an IPO. I predict no company going public will want to be an Internet company by then,\" said one industry executive.\nNevertheless, major companies like microprocessor maker Intel are seeking to drive adoption of Internet technologies forward and to encourage continued entrepreneurial investment, partly to ensure the continued growth of their own businesses.\n\"We don't think there has been enough thinking through of new content capabilities of the Internet,\" said Varney, who predicts one day there will be \"a much more aggressive integration of the Internet than we see today.\"\n", "China's President Jiang Zemin has emerged to rule China after seven years in waiting as heir apparent to Deng Xiaoping and, at 70, among his most pressing tasks will be to identify his own successor.\nDiplomats said finding an heir could be crucial for Jiang if he is to ward off attacks from ambitious younger men or from power-hungry elders who want to run the show from behind a bamboo curtain -- the means chosen by China's Empress Dowager 100 years ago.\n\"Jiang Zemin, who while Deng Xiaoping was alive was the young successor, has become at the moment of Deng's death the incumbent leader who is immediately faced with a succession crisis,\" said Australian Sinologist Geremie Barme.\nChina's leadership has carefully displayed a united front since Deng died on Wednesday aged 92.\nChina-watchers say this may be a facade.\n\"It'll be like a duck swimming -- on the surface it'll be calm but underneath it'll be turbulent,\" said one Chinese analyst, quoting a Chinese proverb.\nIn imperial China, the transfer of the \"mandate of heaven\" to a new emperor was rarely smooth. While the latest power shift so far has been seamless, analysts said later upheavals could not be ruled out.\nJiang must now confront his own mortality and fend off other aspirants to power, among them Qiao Shi, the former security tsar who now heads parliament, economic supremo Zhu Rongji and Premier Li Peng.\nHe will also face assault on his authority from the last two surviving veterans of Deng's generation, former president Yang Shangkun, 89, and former head of parliament Peng Zhen, 95, whose communist credentials are second only to those of Deng.\nIn a system where Deng held supreme power until he drew his last breath -- even though he retired from his last post in 1990 and never held a top job -- political pedigree and traditional respect for age rank high.\nPolitical acumen will be crucial.\nIn the seven years since he was launched into China's top job, Jiang has toiled to make his position unassailable, battling to boost support while picking his way through the political minefield at the top of the party.\nAnalysts say he certainly now ranks as first among equals in a society that finds itself without an all-powerful strongman for the first time this century, but he may have tried too hard.\n\"Unlike Deng Xiaoping, Jiang has shown himself to be an unwise political strategist for he has, in an unprecedented move in post-imperial Chinese history, claimed and maintained control of all three major arms of power,\" Barme said.\n\"It is strategically suicidal,\" he said. \"It is not wise to be front man in everything.\"\nAnalysts said the time may have come for Jiang, well above the official retirement age of 65, to act quickly.\n\"If he was a wise leader, he would quickly manoeuvre himself into a position where he could appoint a successor who could carry out his legacy -- just as Deng appointed a successor,\" Barme said.\n\"So Jiang is faced with the urgent task of devolving power to younger leaders, but may not have the wisdom to carry out such a strategic reformulation of his position\".\nDiplomats agreed that Jiang's amassing of top jobs could hurt rather than help his survival after Deng.\nHis most immediate challenge comes from Premier Li Peng, who completes his second and final term next March, but whose future post must be decided, albeit in secret, at the crucial 15th Party Congress in October.\nLi wants another job. He wants to be president -- or better still head of the party -- and he can argue that Jiang should give up at least one of his jobs, Chinese political analysts say.\nBut Jiang cannot afford to give up his job as head of the party, and doesn't want to stop being president. Therein lies the future power struggle.\n\"Jiang Zemin enjoys the trappings of power,\" said one Western diplomat. \"He likes the pomp and ceremony, the fanfare and red-carpet treatment. He likes to bask in the limelight.\n\"That is a reason why the Li Peng question is so problematic,\" he said.\n\"If Jiang were willing to give up the presidency then the retirement of Li Peng from the premiership would not create so many problems.\"\n", "The Czech Republic's trade deficit nearly doubled in January, year-on-year, as exports stagnated, and analysts said they saw little change in the trend of the burgeoning trade shortfall.\nThe Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said the January trade deficit hit 13.6 billion crowns compared with a 7.86 billion crown deficit in January 1996.\nThe CSU added that imports, led by continued strong inflows of machinery and raw materials, grew by 8.2 percent year-on-year, while exports contracted by 2.5 percent, spurred by a sharp 11.8 percent decrease in raw material exports.\n\"The figures are better than expected...the market expected above 15 billion crowns...but I don't think it will mean any change in the trade (balance's) development,\" said Petr Tomek of Zivnostenska Banka.\nThe bureau did not issue a revised end-year 1996 figure for the trade balance, which hit a record 160.3 billion crowns. It has forecast the 1997 trade deficit to rise to about 215 billion crowns.\nThe CSU said overall nominal imports for January firmed to 60.04 billion crowns from 55.5 billion for the same month last year, while exports totalled 46.45 billion, down from a previous 47.63 billion.\nBoris Gomez of ING Barings said that while January's trade figures were an improvement from December, where the monthly figure was 17.996 billion crowns, the beginning of the year is traditionally a period of slowing trade.\n\"We're not overly encouraged since historically the first two months of the year we usually see relatively lower deficits because of generally weaker trade flows,\" he said.\n\"We are hoping for a stabilisation of the deficit. If what happened last year when the deficit picked up pace in the second quarter, it's not good, though we are banking on import growth slowing a bit given the tight monetary environment.\"\nLast summer the central bank tightened its monetary policy, raising its discount rate one full percentage point to 10.5 percent, and minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months in the Republic hover around 12.5 percent.\nAnalysts added that the trade figures were also influenced by the strengthening of the currency, the crown, which gained some three percentage points against its dollar/mark basket in January, boosted by demand brought about by a wave of over 35 billion crowns worth crown-denominated Eurobonds.\n\"If the Bundesbank sees it policy down the road of keeping the mark relatively weak to help the economy, that's not good news for the Czechs, nor are the rumblings that the economic recovery of the EU may be slower than expected,\" Gomez said.\nCSU figures showed EU countries accounted for more than 60 percent of both imports and exports with the Czech Republic.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n", "Apple Computer Inc.

Apple said it planned to begin notifying employees about the layoffs later this month.\nApple, once the darling of the computer industry, has suffered in recent years from missed opportunities, management turmoil and failed strategies that resulted in the firings of former Chief Executives John Sculley in 1993 and Michael Spindler in 1996.\nApple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who took over about a year ago, said the latest restructuring was aimed at boosting Apple's core business.\n\"The top priorities guiding our reorganization are the rapid delivery of distinctive products for our loyal business, education, and home customers, and the development of a robust next-generation operating system to carry them into the future,\" Amelio said in a statement.\n\"We can best achieve these goals by streamlining our organization, simplifying our product lines to deliver fewer but much stronger models, and stopping investments in activities that are not central to these core businesses,\" he said.\nOver the last five quarters, Apple has posted more than $900 million in losses, reflecting slower sales of its flagship line of Macintosh personal computers and restructuring expenses.\nIn a statement issued after the market closed, Apple said it will phase out its slow-selling Performa Macintosh home computers this spring in favor of Power Mac models.\nDisappointing Christmas sales of the Performa line led to a stunning $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and a steep decline in Apple's market share.\nAccording to research firm Dataquest, Apple's share of the worldwide PC market tumbled to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent in 1995.\nAs part of the restructuring, Apple said it was exploring options for its Netwon hand-held personal assistant and will no longer produce Apple-branded Pippin devices, which enable television sets to access the Internet.\nWhile Apple will continue to enhance its Mac Operating System, the company said some parts of the system -- such as the Open Doc component software technology, Cyberdog, Open Transport, Game Sprockets, and Mac OS Development Tools -- will receive less money for upgrades.\nApple will also halt funding for the Video Conferencing Solution and AIX Server Software.\nThe moves are aimed at cutting Apple's expenses by at least $400 million a year so the company can be profitable with revenues of around $8 billion.\nApple said it was revising the delivery schedule for future Mac Operating System releases but still plans to deliver its latest version, code-named Rhapsody, in 1998.\n", "Philippe Jaffre, chairman of French oil group Elf Aquitaine, is entering the last lap of an ambitious restructuring drive to cut the formerly state-owned conglomerate back to its core oil and chemicals activities.\nAfter a three-year programme to sell assets from a treasury trove lovingly amassed by state-appointed predecessors such as Loik Le Floch Prigent -- now in jail pending trial on fraud charges -- Jaffre this week said he was ready to give up control of the health and beauty products unit Sanofi.\nSanofi, in which Elf holds 53 percent, has a promising product pipeline but needs money to get them to market quickly.\nIts chief executive Jean-Francois Dehecq also has ambitions to play a part in the global pharmaceutical industry's restructuring and needs more financial support.\nAt a board meeting on Wednesday at Elf's imposing glass office tower in Paris's La Defense business district, Jaffre told Dehecq Elf would not commit money to a Sanofi expansion but freed the unit to engage in talks toward an alliance.\n\"Jaffre wanted to send a signal to other pharmaceutical companies that Sanofi is in play,\" a company source said.\nJaffre had previously said Elf would not invest a lot of money in Sanofi because it was trying to reduce its own debt and improve its profitability.\nElf is among the weakest performers in the oil industry. In 1995, its return on equity was 6.5 percent, compared with 12.1 percent at Shell/Royal Dutch and 16.7 percent at Exxon, according to data on Reuters Securities 3000.\nElf said on Thursday its consolidated income for 1996 was up 40 percent at 7.3 billion francs ($1.4 billion) and the board said it was pleased with the recovery stemming from stringent controls.\nIn June 1994, when Sanofi wanted to buy the Sterling Winthrop business from Eastman Kodak, Jaffre agreed with the $1.68 billion acquisition on condition that Sanofi sold assets for the same amount. Dehecq was forced to part with Sanofi's bio-activities and some lacklustre perfume brands.\nJaffre was appointed chairman and chief executive of Elf in 1993 when it was still under state control and he oversaw the privatisation of the group in 1994. The sale of a 64 percent stake in Elf for 385 francs per share generated 14.9 billion francs, representing the biggest privatisation to date.\nBut Elf reported its first ever loss that year, of 5.4 billion francs, after Jaffre took an 8.7 billion charge to clean up the balance sheet and write off overvalued oil reserves and the Texas Gulf phosphate business.\nHe said he aimed to sell 15 billion francs of industrial assets and six billion of financial assets to cut the debt which stood at 46 percent of equity. Most of this programme has been carried out, company sources said.\nJaffre cut investment in the ambitious Leuna refinery project in former East Germany, sold stakes in Entreprise Oil in Britain and Petrofina in Belgium and most recently a stake in Compagnie de Suez.\nElf returned to profit in 1995, reporting income of 5.04 billion francs, and Jaffre stated his goal to place the company in the Top 10 oil firms worldwide in all its activities by 2005.\nWhile it ranks eighth overall, its chemicals are in 13th place, pharmaceuticals in 20th, and the refining and marketing activities are also lagging.\nChemical unit Elf Atochem rode an industry upswing to boost 1995 operating income to 5.0 billion francs from 1.8 billion.\nThe core refining and marketing business remains weak.

It was a buy rather than a sell,\" Mack said.\nCredit Lyonnais has been rescued by the French government twice from collapse under the weight of its lending excesses, and has been under pressure to sell non-French assets to meet conditions set by the European Commission for approving further state aid for the bank.\nBut the deal has raised speculation that Credit Lyonnais will divest its successful brokerage in Hong Kong, and heighten interest in more mergers and acquisitions among fund managers.\n\"Asset management and broking are some of the few parts of Credit Lyonnais making money right now,\" said Day, now an independent consultant after having been laid off as a result of industry consolidation. \"And I would imagine a lot of people will be phoning up other asset managers,\" he added.\nNo layoffs are expected among CLIAM-Asia's 70 staff in four offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, London and San Francisco.

If that doubles, it will add a fair chunk to average revenues for 1997,\" Snook said.\nOrange says it has the lowest \"churn rate\" -- customers disconnecting or being excluded for bad debt or fraud -- in the industry.\nAt 18.6 percent, it has risen from 18.1 percent in 1995 but Orange's calculations still put this well below the industry average of 28 percent clocked up by rivals Vodafone Group Plc, Cellnet and One-2-One.\nSnook said foreign expansion projects apart from those in the Netherlands and Greece were on the back burner.\nBacked by main shareholder Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, Orange is hoping to be the chosen partner to take a 30 percent stake in the cellular arm of Greek national operator OTE this month.\nOrange raised 1.2 billion pounds via a debt facility in December 1995 for its British expansion plans and since then has withdrawn about 785 million pounds.\nMeanwhile, Orange customers will be able to make calls in more than 50 countries by the end of the year using handsets developed by Motorola that operate at both 1800 and 900 MHz.\nThe new handsets should be on offer by April or May.

They include $110 per share for 40 percent of the outstanding Conrail shares and 1.85619 shares of CSX common stock for each Conrail share.\nThe proposed merger of Conrail and CSX, first announced on Oct. 15, would create a giant that would dominate the rail freight industry on the East Coast.\nIn early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Conrail shares traded at $100.375, up $1.375, and CSX traded at $44, down $1.25. Norfolk Southern traded at $86.375, down 12.5 cents, also on the NYSE.\nCSX and Conrail also established a voting trust to permit payment to Conrail shareholders by 1997.\nThe companies said a Conrail shareholder meeting slated for Dec. 23 would be rescheduled for Jan. 17 and the CSX tender offer would be extended to Jan 22.\nThe revised pact prohibits Conrail and CSX from entering into an agreement with a third party until Dec 31, 1998. The previous transaction set a July 1997 date.\n\"In every respect this merger holds great potential and clearly offers the best result for Conrail. This amendment to the merger agreement reaffirms the decision of the Conrail board that it is not willing to agree to the sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern,\" Conrail chairman David LeVan said in a statement.\nCSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in a cash tender offer at $110 per share and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent.\n\"The actions taken by the CSX and Conrail boards allow us to move on to the next stage of the process, the filing of our merger application with the (Surface Transportation Board),\" the federal regulatory agency overseeing railroads, said CSX chairman John Snow.\n", "China's sugar factories could ease their financial woes by taking advantage of Far East demand and exporting to Asian users but they are unlikely to be given the go-ahead soon, trade and industry sources said on Wednesday.\nChinese producers, most of which are burdened by low prices and high debts, could earn $15-20 a tonne exporting white sugar to the region, a trader with a Western bank in Hong Kong said.\nRecent Indonesian purchases of Thai sugar had tightened regional supply, which could mean Asian buyers will have to look elsewhere for their sugar, he said.\n\"If you take the Thai white sugar out of the market, other importers will need to find a place for sugars, so you could find interest coming from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Philippines,\" he said.\n\"And that's when China will come in as a replacement,\" he said.\nBut that wasn't likely to happen any time soon, an official of the China Sugar Association told Reuters.\n\"The international prices are not at a level we could be happy with,\" he said by telephone from Nanning, capital of Guangxi province where most of China's sugar is produced.  \nTraders in Hong Kong said the current premium on white sugar over raw was $70 a tonne, but Far Eastern white sugar had a further $20 because of the cheaper regional freight rates.\nThe association source said the Chinese government had agreed to buy locally produced sugar for central reserves in the hope of shoring up prices still well below break-even point for the factories.\nThese guaranteed sales would help factories, most of which had to repay bank loans at the end of the season, he said.\nGuangxi's sugar reserves currently held 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes, he said. The national figure was not available.\nCentral reserve sugar would not be released on to the market before ex-factory prices hit 4,400 to 4,500 yuan per tonne, another trader in Hong Kong said.\nWholesale prices had not moved above 3,800 yuan ($457) a tonne for two months, the sugar association source said, speaking anonymously. Breakeven point for factories was 4,000 yuan a tonne, he said.\nDomestic demand has been flat for the past year or so, the official said, so it was difficult to predict when prices would start to firm and factories could see some profit.  \nTraders said they hoped prices would firm once the harvest and crushing season finished in late March.\nSugar prices had been expected to firm in the lead-up to the Lunar New Year holiday, China's premier annual festival when confectionary demand traditionally soars.\nThis was not the case this year, said Asian traders just returned from their five-day break.\nSlack demand for the festival compounded on-going flat consumption of soft drinks, sweets, ice-cream and other sweet luxuries that has kept China's annual sugar demand figure to around eight million tonnes in recent years, a trader with a Chinese firm in Hong Kong said.\nHe blamed China's sluggish economy. \"If people are watching their pennies, they are not going to want to spoil themselves.\"\nChinese sugar demand should pick up as the summer approaches, he said, but it will be six to eight weeks before the factories see higher than break-even prices.\nChina's current sugar crop has been officially predicted at 6.6 million tonnes, a figure most traders polled by Reuters agreed on, though one put it closer to 6.3 million tonnes.\nImports, which central authorities have said will be 690,000 tonnes in 1997, are not expected to begin before mid-year.\n-- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004\n", "Intel Corp. on Wednesday will unveil its Pentium II microprocessor, a speedy computer chip that will help the world's biggest chip maker break into new markets and stave off rivals.\nThe new chip is based on the Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro, but includes software and circuitry -- dubbed MMX technology -- that makes it more adept at handling graphics. In most cases, it works 30 percent to 40 percent faster than today's mainstream Intel products, analysts said.\nAbout a dozen personal computer makers will announce Wednesday they plan to use the chip in high-end machines, said Richard Dracott, Intel marketing manager.\nMost of the new Pentium II machines will be desktop PCs aimed at engineers and professionals who use a lot of computing horsepower for graphics, analysts said.\nAlthough the Pentium II is a souped-up version of the Pentium Pro, it is the biggest product introduction for Intel in years, said Mark Kirstein, research director at semiconductor market researcher In-Stat in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\"The Pentium Pro was really a niche product\" for high-end desktops and servers, the computers that control networks, Kirstein said. \"The Pentium II is aimed at the mainstream.\"\nA streamlined design and cheaper production will make it easier for Intel to churn out the new chip, Kirstein said.\nWithin a year, most new PCs -- even the ones geared for home use -- will be based on the Pentium II, analysts said.\nIntel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., also is trying to pitch the chip to new kinds of customers. The company has told video game makers, for example, that the chip can handle the intense graphics requirements of coin-operated arcade games.\n\"We will be delivering significant performance improvement over the fastest Pentium Pro,\" Dracott said.\nIntel said part of the performance improvement comes from a new so-called cartridge design. The Pentium II will be sold to PC manufacturers in a plastic housing that includes specialised memory chips. Because the microprocessor and memory chips are packed closely together on a seperate circuit board, they can pump data to the rest of the PC much faster, Intel said.\nThere is one more benefit: It frustrates Intel rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp., which for the first time are a credible threat to Intel.\nAMD and Cyrix make chips that work like the Pentium and sell them to PC makers for much less. But their chips are designed to fit into the old slots for microprocessors.\nAMD spent the past two years working on the K6 chip, which works as fast as the Pentium Pro and is 25 percent cheaper, but does not fit into the new cartridge slot.\nSince most of the PC makers are expected to use Intel's cartridge design, AMD now has to spend time and money to make the K6 compatible.\n", "David Jones, chief executive of British fashion retailer Next Plc, on Monday rejected as nonsense press reports that he had been approached by headhunters to take over the top job at Sears.\nSome shareholders at stores group Sears are disgruntled with the dismal performance of the group and are calling for a radical shake-up including a demerger of its very profitable Selfridges department store and the sale of the struggling British Shoe Corporation.\nSears was back in the spotlight last week when it issued a profit warning and reported disappointing Christmas sales, leading to suggestions that chief executive Liam Strong's job was on the line.\nThe Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported that Jones was offered the job of chief executive of Sears but had decided to turn it down.\nBut Jones told Reuters in an interview on his carphone, \"I'm very happy in my current job. I am not intending to leave Next. As far as I am concerned no one is headhunting me for any job.\"\nAlthough Sears sold its mail order business Freemans earlier this month to Littlewoods  LWD.CN for 395 million pounds ($656 million) and pledged to return about 410 million in cash to shareholders in six months' time, some investors are calling for deeper changes.\nSears shares, which traded at 90p on Monday, have underperformed the stockmarket by over 40 percent since Strong took the helm five years ago.\nJones is accredited with rescuing Next from the brink of collapse in the early 1990s -- in the midst of Britain's deepest recession since the second world war -- by combining a sell-off programme of non-core assets, such as mail order business Grattan, and a sharper focus on the main brand.\nHe sold shops and merged others, improving the Next profile on the high street and reducing shoppers' confusion about the range and type of products on sale.\nOn December 6, 1990, Next shares reached a low of 7p compared with 573p today.

The talks have been postponed for a fortnight.\"\nNews of the eleventh-hour grounding of talks came as the European Commission kicked off a separate series of private hearings in Brussels into the proposed British Airways and American Airlines alliance, which is conditional on an open skies pact being clinched.\nBritish and U.S. carriers expressed regret that the Anglo-U.S. talks had been delayed. But sources reiterated that this round of talks had not been expected to deliver a final deal.\n\"It's not damaging. The two sides had been talking informally anyway and this round was never billed as the breakthrough round,\" one U.S. airline spokesman said. \"It was meant to deal with more boring issues like ground handling.\"\nThe two sides are believed to have been inching closer, but Scott Yohe, senior vice-president of government affairs at Delta Air Lines Inc, told Reuters he believed full agreement was not possible in the current round. He said a deal is likely to emerge in subsequent talks.\nBut a number of other major hurdles need to be cleared. First the British government wants to try to link the open skies talks with the BA/AA alliance. The U.S. wants to keep the talks and alliance approval as two distinct issues.\nBritain is still waiting for its competition watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading, to give a final verdict on the alliance after receiving responses from the airline industry.\nIn particular, airlines are waiting for a clarification on how BA should divest itself of 168 landing slots at London's Heathrow airport -- a condition for the BA/AA deal to be cleared by the Office of Fair Trading.\n\"Buying/selling of slots is fundamental to any (open skies) deal,\" said one U.S. airline spokesman.\nWhether BA can sell them or must give them away remains a grey area. Britain says the decision lies with the government, but the European Commission says it has final jurisdiction and claims that selling slots is banned under EU law.\nAnother issue within the open skies framework is the argument by the British government for some protection for smaller airlines taking the full brunt of competition under an open skies regime.\nBritain is trying to secure a dispute reconciliation procedure. This is believed to be for the benefit of players like Virgin Atlantic, the transatlantic carrier owned by entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group.\nAnother complicating factor is the chance of a British election being announced in the coming weeks, which could put the talks on the backburner.\nWith the opposition Labour Party riding high in opinion polls, one industry insider said that if there was a change of government \"there is the possibility that Labour will want to start from scratch.\"\n", "Boehringer Mannheim Corp, a unit of privately held Corange Ltd, said data released Monday at an American College of Cardiology conference leveled the playing field between Boehringer and Genentech Inc in the market for clot-busting drugs to treat acute heart attack.\n\"What this study showed was comparability between the two products.... Essentially, at this point it will be a marketing fight,\" said Gregory Fulton, director of marketing for Boehringer's pharmaceuticals unit.  \nResults from the GUSTO III study showed that Boehringer's Retavase did not save more lives than Genentech's Activase, better known as TPA, researchers reported. In the trial, 10,139 patients received Retavase, while 4,921 patients received TPA. Both drugs, as well as another called streptokinase, are commonly administered within six hours after a heart attack.\n\"Retavase...did not provide statistically significant benefit in 30-day mortality as compared to (TPA),\" Genentech said in a statement released in conjunction with reporting of the data.  \nAs a result, Genentech said, Retavase failed to score the win which Boehringer had hoped for from the study -- proof that the drug is better than TPA, long the dominant drug in the field.\n\"We do not dispute that. The results were very clear,\" said Boehringer's Fulton. At the same time, he said, GUSTO III showed the two drugs to be roughly comparable and Boehringer is \"very happy with that.\"\nThe researchers reported that the study's 30-day mortality rate was 7.43 percent for Retavase, versus 7.22 percent for TPA; total intracranial bleeding rate for Retavase was 0.91 percent and 0.88 percent for TPA; and total stroke rate for Retavase was 1.67 percent and 1.83 percent for TPA.\n\"GUSTO III reinforces the role (TPA) plays in savings lives every day,\" Genentech vice president of clinical research Dr. David Stump said in a statement.\n", "Russia's powerful Gazprom GAZP.RTS pushed back a plan on Wednesday to issue more share look-alikes for foreigners, saying it needed time to clear out its massive debts to give its stock time to appreciate.\nBut the company also issued a challenge to the government to meet it half way as it struggles to make tax and other payments which are crucial to the functioning of Russia's economy.\nEduard Ivanov, director of securities at the world's largest natural gas producer, told a news conference RAO Gazprom planned to issue a second tranche of its American Depositary Shares (ADS) next year, not this year as previously planned.\n\"We consider it expedient to place this tranche in 1998... However the exact timing has not yet been set,\" he said.\nHe said Gazprom still planned to start issuing convertible bonds this year and that the ADSs would be sold on U.S. markets.\nBut company officials said one reason for the ADS delay was Gazprom's tortuous efforts to find a common language with the government -- once its unquestioning supporter -- on payments by the giant company into the budget and state funds.\nMuch is at stake. Gazprom accounted for 26 percent of Russia's 1996 tax revenue -- a whopping figure which underscores the wealth of the company and its key role in Moscow's efforts to plug the budget deficit and keep market reforms on track.\nGazprom, with a market capitalisation of $16.5 billion, accounts for over one-third of global gas reserves, 95 percent of Russian gas output and 39 percent of the world's gas trade.\n\"We are taking the responsibility to pay our debts,\" Pyotr Rodionov, deputy chairman of Gazprom's board and a former energy minister, said. \"But we also demand the government take steps to meet us halfway, especially in planning the 1998 budget.\"\n\"It's time for the state to conduct itself correctly with regard to payments from energy companies,\" he said, referring to what he thought were unrealistic state revenue targets.\nGazprom has been the target of attacks by the cabinet's fresh-faced reformers, who have promised the giant will not be broken up but want it to pay its corporate and other debts.\nGazprom argues that its consumers -- mostly gas-fired power plants and industrial enterprises -- are late payers fuelling a payments crisis whose blame is laid at Gazprom's door.\nThe company -- once a ministry, once headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and now quite coveted by foreign investors -- took pains last month to say peace had broken out in talks with the cabinet on its arrears.\nGazprom said it still owed 3.5 trillion roubles ($608 million), down from an estimated 14.8 trillion ($2.6 billion).\nBut Rodionov said the two sides needed common understanding.\n\"We must first sort out our relations to the state,\" he said, describing what needed to happen before Gazprom offered more of its equity to foreign investors. \"That is the element which will facilitate growth in our share price.\"\nIn a sign the government is still sympathetic to Gazprom's problems, a senior official said on Tuesday one option would be to transfer assets of indebted power companies to Gazprom. Gazprom's first tranche of ADSs, issued in October 1996 and listed in London, set foreign investors drooling. The company plans to make nine percent of its capital available to foreign investors -- who currently own less than two percent.\nIt accounts for 60 percent of Europe's gas imports but plans to sell even more by raising capital abroad for its $45 billion Yamal project linking Arctic gas fields to Western consumers.\nSome of the money will come from the ADSs; other from a bridging loan of $1.2 billion and medium term credits of up to $3 billion dollars, for which Gazprom has mandated banks Credit Lyonnais and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.\nA Gazprom official who declined to be identified said ABN-Amro and Goldman Sachs -- which were awarded but lost the mandates -- would probably still arrange Gazprom's planned Eurobond.\n\"Every bank wants to work with us,\" Rodionov said. \"Of course it's a competitive battle.\"\nGazprom has a strictly-divided share structure separating paper available on the Russian market from that on foreign markets, where ADSs effectively cost three times as much as Russian paper. But Rodionov said this could be tough.\n\"A lock on a door won't stop a cheater,\" he said.\n", "Britain's Northern Electric challenged predator CE Electric on Friday to raise its 630 pence per share bid as it paraded results and forecasts which it claimed proved it was worth more.\n\"They need to get their cheque book out if they are going to further this bid at all,\" Northern chairman David Morris told a news conference.\nBut CE Electric, the British bid vehicle for U.S. energy group CalEnergy, said in a statement that Northern's results were \"lacklustre\" and below its expectations.\nThe regional electricity company, or Rec, said pretax profits for the six months ending September 30 slipped to 50.7 million pounds ($85.12 million) from 58.7 million pounds and an interim dividend of 12.85 pence was paid out, up from 12 pence.\nFull year pretax profits would be more than 112 million pounds, the company said, with a final dividend forecast of 29.85 pence.\nNorthern, which last year fended off a bid from Trafalgar House, now part of Kvaerner, with a 560 million pound shareholder benefit package, said gearing should fall to 95 percent by March 31 compared with forecasts last year of 175 percent.\nMorris said CE Electric \"is clearly going to have to pay a great deal more than 630 pence per share\" to win control.\nHe said the company would be willing to talk with CE Electric \"on the basis of more than 700 pence\", but executives said at 630 pence there was nothing to discuss.\nNorthern has claimed that CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., had indicated a price of 700 pence before it launched its hostile bid in October.\nCE Electric denied that claim and went on to snap up nearly 30 percent of Northern as its shares languished, weighed by concerns that the U.K. government might block the bid.\n\"I do not think they (Northern) have announced anything that is going to make CE Electric put its price up,\" said one sector analyst.\nBut a second analyst said he thought there was \"clearly value there in excess of 630 pence,\" and suggested the two sides might be able to come to an agreed bid at a higher level.\nShares in the Rec fell one penny to 589 pence by 1415 GMT.\nNorthern said gearing, without payment of a special dividend of 56.5 pence due in February under last year's defence package, would be roughly in line with other electricity companies.\nIt argued that, based on the forecast cash flow for 1997, it should be valued at 745 pence a share to balance the current agreed bid for a fellow Rec, East Midlands Electricity, from Dominion Resources of the U.S.\nThat bid valued East Midlands at 670 pence per share but its stock was also dampened by government approval worries and was trading at 609 pence, up 1.5 pence.\n\"We are simply pointing out the value of Northern Electric,\" Morris said, adding that if the government approved the bid, the figures would be more fully appreciated.\nNorthern has said it felt the government should approve the bid but maintained that 630 pence did not represent its true value.\n\"These results and forecasts help to demonstrate that there is significant further value within Northern Electric, value which CE Electric's offer fails to reflect,\" Morris said.\nSome analysts said the results and forecasts underlined the judgement that CE Electric's bid undervalued the company.\n\"The company is worth something around 670 pence, if you exclude the bid premium and shareholders should hold out for something nearer 700 pence,\" said one analyst, anonymously.

We must not underestimate (President Ernesto) Samper's bad faith and capacity for trickery,\" former justice minister Enrique Parejo told Reuters.\nSamper reiterated on Monday his commitment to seeing an end to the constitutional ban on sending Colombians to stand trial abroad, saying \"it forms part of our policies in the international struggle against drugs\".\nBut Parejo believes Samper is merely paying lip service to the idea of extradition to placate the United States, which blacklisted Colombia for a second consecutive year for its perceived failure to crack down on drug trafficking.\nA Senate committee is due to re-open a government- sponsored debate on extradition on Tuesday following a confusing session last week, which ended in a hung vote and left legislators and ministers arguing over congressional rules.\nEven if one of three extradition proposals due for debate clears all congressional hurdles and makes it onto the statute books, Parejo believes it would be so complex as to be unworkable.\nThe alternatives range from the simple abrogation of Article 35 from the constitution -- the one banning extradition of Colombian nationals -- to one that includes widespread restrictions on when extradition could be applied.\n\"This is all part of a manoeuvre by the government. Even if some form of extradition is passed then it will really amount to nothing because there will be so many regulations that these would frustrate the whole process,\" Parejo said.\nExtradition was banned in 1991 after Pablo Escobar, the late head of the notorious Medellin drug cartel, launched a spate of bombings and kidnappings against the state.\nWhen Samper took office in August 1994, amid allegations that he financed his election campaign with donations from the Cali drug mob, he said restoration of extradition was not on his political agenda.\nSamper and his top ministers have reversed that position in the face of increasing pressure from the United States, which has consistently pressed for extradition of the jailed Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, former chiefs of the notorious Cali cartel.\nBut Parejo believes Samper is now giving verbal backing to the restoration of extradition safe in the knowledge that Colombian law makes it virtually impossible to apply new legislation retroactively.\n", "A Hong Kong member of the Chinese committee handling the territory's return handed a letter to Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday protesting against Beijing's plan to dilute civil liberties laws.\nFrederick Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, handed the letter to Qian just before the start of a two-day plenary session of the 150-member Preparatory Committee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.\n\"I gave a document to him in the hope he will study it,\" Fung told reporters. \"I have a different view on the Preparatory Committee proposal to repeal several provisions of the Bill of Rights.\"\nBeijing's plans to repeal or amend a list of 25 Hong Kong laws and ordinances, including parts of its Bill of Rights, will be debated at the session of the caucus responsible for shaping Hong Kong's future in the countdown to the handover this year.\nThe announcement this month from Beijing, which said the laws contradicted Hong Kong's future mini-constitution the Basic Law, has sparked outrage in the British colony and forceful objections from London and its allies.\n\"I feel if it doesn't violate the Basic Law it should not be retracted,\" Fung told reporters.\n\"If the Preparatory Committee abolishes the provisions of the Bill of Rights it will create unnecessary worries and be detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997,\" Fung said in his letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.\nFung's protest followed an attack on Thursday by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten who lashed out at what he called China's repugnant proposal to dilute Hong Kong's civil liberties after it recovers the British colony at midnight on June 30.\n\"On the Bill of Rights, not only does it not contradict the Basic Law, but is necessary for implementing... the two regulations on adapting human rights conventions to Hong Kong,\" said the letter by Fung, who is also a member of the territory's Beijing-appointed provisional legislature.\n\"I believe the abolition of the above bill will bring instability to the rule of law in the future special region,\" he said. Fung's group advocates democracy for Hong Kong but through cooperation rather than confrontation with Beijing.\nFung also voiced opposition to China's decision to repeal recent Hong Kong regulations formally allowing political parties, warning that Beijing's decision to return to the British colonial era system would affect Hong Kong stability as well as its credibility.\n\"I believe that to restore these provisions is totally against developing toward the casting off of colonialism and against the principle of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong,\" he said in the letter.\nHong Kong's post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa, who is attending the crucial committee meeting in Beijing, argued in defence of Beijing's move that the international community had misconstrued the situation.\nU.S. President Bill Clinton has expressed concern. Britain summoned the Chinese ambassador in London order to lodge a protest and Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind plans to pursue the issue in a meeting with Qian next month.\nQian has insisted the transition process is going well.\n", "The former Soviet Union will probably see grain output increase this year after last year's drought-hit disaster, industry officials said on Friday.\nBut unpredictable weather in Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, the region's biggest grain producers, could still hit volume and quality levels.\n\"Ukraine was very bad last year, Russia was quite low and Kazakhstan was below average,\" said Andrei Sizov of SovEcon Ltd, a private agricultural consultancy in Moscow, referring to 1996 output levels that were among the worst in three decades.\n\"This year, weather conditions have so far been better for all three. But 'better' is in comparison to what was last year's really bad situation.\"\nKazakhstan and Ukraine export much of their surplus grain to Russia and other former Soviet republics, as well as to Eastern and Central Europe. Kazakhstan accounted for up to three quarters of Russia's wheat and wheat flour imports last year.\nSowing in the three countries is nearly complete, and industry sources said the weather, not low agricultural inputs, was the main factor -- and the main unknown.\n\"I think we can definitely say output in all three countries will improve on last year, but it's all still unpredictable because the weather is unpredictable,\" said Vladimir Totsky, deputy director of Russia's Grain Union, a private grouping of traders and producers.\nRussia may finally reverse a five-year trend of declining grain area, with around 30 million hectares sown, not including maize, on public-sector farms.\n\"This is more than enough for Russia to meet its needs,\" Sizov said, forecasting net wheat output of 35-38 million tonnes compared with last year's 35 million. \"Imports will fall and there may be material for export.\"\nOfficials have forecast net grain output of at least 70 million tonnes after last year's 69.3 million, which was the second worst crop in three decades.\nAverage temperatures in the European part of Russia were five to six degrees Celsius lower than normal at the end of May, Viktor Trenin of the State Meteorological Service said, adding the cold had not seriously hurt crops.\nBut Siberia and the Urals had the most unusual weather in a century, he said, adding that very hot, dry temperatures in recent weeks made crops grow too fast and sucked moisture away.\nAn expected cold snap with possible frosts could further hurt plantings, he said, adding, \"We haven't seen fluctuations like this in 100 years. It's dangerous.\" He said it was too early to predict weather patterns in the coming months.\nAn Agriculture Ministry official said Russian winter grains were in good condition, with winterkill losses the lowest in five years at five percent, compared with last year's eight to 11 percent.\nIn Ukraine, crops were planted two weeks late and experienced a cooler, wet spring. Totsky said yields were below 1996 levels.\nUkrainian officials have declined to forecast summer weather conditions, but Sizov said net grain output in the former breadbasket would rise to 31-33 million tonnes from last year's paltry 25.4 million. The government has forecast 35 million tonnes.\nIn Kazakhstan, the most secretive of the big former Soviet producers, officials have declined to forecast publicly how output might improve on last year's official, drought-hit 11.6 million tonnes. Almaty's Agro-Industrial Exchange sees output at a net 14 million tonnes.\n\"They had some problems with their sowing campaign,\" said Totsky, referring to official figures showing the area sown to grain down to 14.5 million hectares from 1996's 16.1 million.\nThe giant Central Asian state saw an early spring with heavy rains. Sizov said the weather was a big factor in northern Kazakhstan, where drought often mixes with downpours and snows during the autumn harvest.\n\"Every year, we have to wait and see what cards the weather deals us,\" said Totsky. \"This year will be better, but there's still an element of unpredictability.\"\n--Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520\n", "Canadian police said on Wednesday that they laid more charges in the widening sex scandal involving young boys at Maple Leaf Gardens, the fabled home of the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nPolice on Wednesday filed 50 more charges of sexual abuse against Gordon Stuckless, 47, a former backstage helper at the Gardens.\nStuckless, whose bail hearing was postponed to March 27, now faces 52 charges of indecent assault, gross indecency and buggery.\nStuckless and another former Gardens' employee, John Paul Roby, allegedly lured teen-aged boys to the arena with free tickets and autographs of their hockey heroes.\nRoby is currently facing 75 charges of sexual abuse.\nToronto police detective Dave Tredrea said the investigation was not over.\n\"If enough grounds come up and other suspects come up, then they will be charged accordingly,\" Tredrea said in a telephone interview.\nPolice have said the abuse took place in the back rooms of the arena, sometimes during hockey games or other events.\nThe sordid tale, which may involve up to 90 victims between the late 1960s and early 1990s, has grabbed newspaper headlines across the country.\nThe scandal surfaced after 34-year-old Martin Kruze came forward with allegations of sexual abuse. \"Maple Leaf Gardens was a sex haven of abused boys, tons of them,\" Kruze has said of the abuse he said started when he was 13.\nMeanwhile, Gardens management has named a Toronto police veteran to review security at the arena.\nRetired deputy police chief Walter Tyrrell has said his review will include how the company screens potential employees.\nIt's not the only sex abuse case to rock hockey this year.\nGraham James, one of Canada's top junior coaches, pleaded guilty in January to sexually assaulting two players in the 1980s and was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison.\nJames admitted to more than 300 instances of sexual assault over six years against Boston Bruins player Sheldon Kennedy, who was 14 when the assaults began in 1984.\nThe revelations hit hard in a nation where it is traditional for parents of boys with pro hockey aspirations to turn their children over to the care of junior coaches, often far from home.\n", "Toronto's stock market soared to the eighth record close of 1997, rallying on the back of high-flying golds and lots of takeover news in Canada's oil patch.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index lept 60.40 points to end at 6225.78.

Nomura has repeatedly denied any participation in the scam, saying it was the work of three former executives.\nIt is now up to prosecutors to determine if there is enough evidence to file charges in the case.\nIn a sign that the probe may have a sweeping impact on Nomura, the SESC said that some of the improper orders were handled by more junior employees, which could bring more names into the scandal.\nNomura issued a statement apologising for the scandal.\n\"We deeply apologise for the inconvenience the scandal has caused to our customers and the public,\" it said.\n\"We are taking the complaints seriously...We will make a 'fresh start' to prevent a recurrence of such events.\"\nThe government sources said the SESC would start drawing up proposals for civil penalties against Nomura immediately. But they added that it was too early to say how long it would take the SESC to present the proposals to the Finance Ministry.\nMarket sources say the Finance Ministry may suspend part of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as punishment for the scandal.\nThis would be the heaviest ever penalty imposed on a securities firm in Japan.\nThe scandal has already casted a long shadow over Nomura's business and prompted many clients to shun the financial powerhouse.\nIn March alone, Nomura's current profit dropped to about half the usual monthly levels due to the scandal, which cut its brokerage commissions and its share of the underwriting market, a company executive said in April.\nNomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo bourse fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it had held since February 1992.\nIn the first fallout from the SESC action, the Ministry of Finance said late on Tuesday that Nomura was being suspended from taking part in Japanese Government Bond auctions and underwriting activities.\nNomura's admission in March that two of its directors were involved in transferring Nomura money into the account of a corporate client linked to a sokaiya racketeer was a major blow to the image of the Japanese brokering industry.\nIn 1991, Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were found to be paying improper compensation to favoured clients. Top executives at Nomura resigned that year over payments and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters.\nNomura made a sweeping reshuffle of its top management late last month in an effort to win back public trust in the wake of the scandal.

U.S. Robotics dropped $1.875 to $59.125, also on Nasdaq, and was the second-most active share.\nAnalysts said the proposed stock swap unveiled Wednesday undervalued Skokie, Ill.-based U.S. Robotics, the world's leading maker of computer modems for the consumer market.\n\"I think U.S. Robotics shareholders are being robbed,\" said Donaldson Lufkin analyst Eric Buck, who harshly criticised the terms of the deal.\nSeveral analysts said the offer -- involving stock and options valued at $7.3 billion in all -- put a low-ball value on U.S. Robotics of 20 times annual earnings vs. its historic multiple of 25.\n\"If anything, this deal is more of a take-under than a takeover,\" Salomon analyst Peter Swartz said of the 3Com deal. \"Both stocks are down 50 percent from their highs.\" Swartz noted that many network stocks are trading at historic lows.\nU.S. Robotics Chairman Casey Cowell said the sale price was \"absolutely\" not too low, noting that networking company valuations have been very volatile recently and that both U.S. Robotics and 3Com stock prices have fallen.\n3Com especially has been under pressure after announcing its fiscal third quarter revenues would be weaker and that it cut prices on its core product, its adapter cards.\nThe merger, if approved by shareholders and government regulators, would create a combined company with $5 billion in annual revenues and 12,000 employees -- second only to leader Cisco Systems Inc. with more than $6 billion in annual revenues. The merger also comes as the Internet and other computer networks continue to grow in importance.\nAnalysts said the deal put pressure on other network equipment players to use their stock to fund major acquisitions of their own.\n\"We believe the competitive landscape of the networking sector is undergoing a fundamental restructuring,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Bill Rabin said in published comments. \"Other networking vendors will have to combine or be bought.\"\nAlong with 3Com and U.S. Robotics, network company stocks were among the most actively traded on Nasdaq Thursday.\nCisco Systems fell $3.06 to $55.06, Ascend Communications Inc. dropped $5.375 to $57, and Cascade Communications Corp. slipped $2.50 to $30.125.\nThe main beneficiaries of the 3Com-Robotics deal appeared to be Bay Networks Inc. and Shiva Corp. -- two stocks that have sat in the doghouse for some time -- based on their potential as acquisition targets, analysts said.\nShiva rose 62.5 cents to $15.875 on Nasdaq, recovering from its historic low, while Bay added 12.5 cents to $19.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"The merger forces other players in the industry to ante up to play in this bigger game,\" said Steve Harmon, an independent financial analyst who publishes the Internet Stock Report.\n\"It forces equipment makers to look for end-to-end solutions supplying network products to both businesses and consumers,\" he said, referring to how the 3Com-Robotics merger would allow the combined company to compete in both markets.\nThe pressure to do deals adds to the burdens already weighing on the computer network industry, analysts said.\nEarnings shortfalls or close calls, fears of slowing industry growth and cautionary comments from 3Com, Cascade and Shiva have triggered fears about the whole sector, Rabin said.\nIn addition, technology changes in the industry and the growing threat of competition from outsiders like chip makers Intel Corp. and Rockwell International Corp. have dimmed the outlook for the industry as a whole.\nSome analysts cited fears that Intel may decide to integrate network adapter cards or modem chips directly into the computer chassis it builds, rendering stand-alone products from many network suppliers a commodity -- if not obsolete.\n", "The Justice Department is investigating possible bid rigging during airwaves auctions held by the federal government for wireless phone licenses.\nJustice Department documents obtained Wednesday by Reuters showed the department's antitrust division also is looking into whether bidders schemed illegally to divvy up the licenses being sold.\nThe Federal Communications Commission has raised more than $20 billion since 1995 by selling licenses to companies offering a new generation of cellular phone service known as \"personal communications services,\" or PCS.\nA Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the investigation. She said the antitrust division was \"looking into the possibility of anticompetitive conduct by bidders in connection with the FCC's auctioning of spectrum for PCS.\"\nShe declined to comment on whether the investigation covers all three of the big PCS auctions that have been held. But sources familiar with the matter said the department is seeking information from companies about all of the sales.\nThe department documents focus on the PCS auction that ended in mid-January and raised $2.5 billion. It involved dozens of bidders.\nAt that auction, the FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making it the most licenses sold at once. A third of the licenses were reserved for small-company bidders.\nTop bidders were units of Sprint Corp., AT&amp;T Corp. and BellSouth Corp.\nA spokesman for Atlanta-based BellSouth said the company had not been informed by the government of any investigation.\nA spokesman for New York-based AT&amp;T said the No. 1 long-distance carrier had received a request for information from the Justice Department and intended to coperate fully.\nA spokeswoman at Westwood, Kan.-based Sprint had no immediate comment.\nAttorneys familiar with the investigation said the department has sent out \"numerous\" letters requesting information and documents from auction participants.\nThe \"civil investigative demand\" seeks information about companies' bids, their bidding strategies and communications about the auction with other telecommunications firms.\nIn a sign that the investigation is looking into the possibility of bid \"signaling\" among participants, the department requested documents showing the last three digits of company bids.\nOne attorney familiar with the investigation said it was evident during the bidding that companies used the last three digits of their dollar bidding figure to signal their intentions to other auction participants.\n\"It's clear a certain amount of this was taking place,\" said the attorney, who spoke on condition of not being identified.\nAttorneys expect antitrust investigators will focus on whether companies used such practices to stay out of each other's markets during bidding, or to influence prices.\nIn particular, investigators are expected to probe whether some of the bidding practices merely represented bluffing, or were indeed antitrust violations, said attorneys.\nCompanies hired academics and game theorists to help advise during the PCS sales.\nFCC officials declined to comment on the investigation.\nBut sources said the agency had been alerted about the practice of \"signaling.\"\nAttorneys said a company involved in the January PCS auction, High Plains Wireless LP, had asked the FCC to take away Mercury PCS II LLC's licenses. High Plains accused Mercury of improper signalling involving licenses in Texas.\nMercury has denied the charge.\nThe Justice Department investigation comes at a rocky time for the FCC's airwaves sales. An auction that ended last week raised a disappointing $13.6 million, with licenses for some wireless communications markets fetching just $1 apiece.\nThe total was way below the $1.8 billion that Congress was banking on to help eliminate the federal deficit.\n", "Boeing on Monday scrapped plans to build a new, larger version of its 747 jumbo jet in the near future, saying market conditions do not currently justify the risk and expense, estimated at more than $7 billion.\nInstead, the Seattle-based company plans to focus its development efforts at coming up with new versions of its medium-sized 767 and 777 twinjets, executives said.\nThe decision, announced late in the day, marks an end to more than three years of research that included a joint study by Boeing and partner companies in its European rival, Airbus Industrie into a double-decker jet with room for 600 to 800 passengers.\nBoeing's move to sharply scale back its so-called 747-X program leaves Airbus alone in the market with a proposed all-new superjumbo plane that could seat 600 passengers, compared with 416 in a typical three-class configuration for the current-generation 747-400.\nBut analysts have expressed skepticism that Airbus would be able to raise the funding needed to build such a jet. Airbus executives say their superjumbo, dubbed the A-3XX, could be built for $7 billion, but industry sources put the cost at closer to $15 billion.\n\"If Airbus is going to launch a big airplane, they're going to have to fund it privately,\" said Bill Whitlow, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in Seattle. \"With Boeing throwing in the towel, it's going to make it that much more difficult for them to convince investors that it's worthwhile.\"\nIn a news release, Boeing commercial airplane group President Ron Woodard said the manufacturer would leave some employees on the 747-X program to continue to study a possible larger version of the four-engine plane.\n\"This remains one of the priorities of our product development efforts,\" he said. \"When the market develops for such an airplane, we will be ready.\"\nJohn Hayhurst, vice president and general manager for the 747-X, said about 1,000 people had been working on the program, more than half of whom will be shifted into new 767 and 777 models.\nHayhurst said the decision to focus on the smaller wide-body jets reflects the company's conclusion that trans-Pacific air traffic increasingly will shift away from larger hub cities and toward more thinly traveled city pairs.\n\"We think there's going to be increasing fragmentation on long-haul routes, and less dependence on hubs,\" he said. \"That will require airplanes of the 767 and 777 size.\"\nBoeing market projections foresee a demand for no more than 470 jets with 500 seats or more over the next 20 years, which is unlikely to be sufficient to produce an acceptable return to shareholders on the investment needed to design a larger wing and make other changes for the proposed 747 derivatives, Hayhurst said.\nWhitlow said Boeing could reduce the market demand for new large jets even further by enhancing its line of medium-sized jets.\nFor example, Boeing has announced plans for a stretched version of the 777 that would seat 400 people, nearly as many as the 747. Another version being proposed would have a range of 10,000 miles (16,000 km), more than any other commercial jet, allowing an airline to fly between city pairs such as Singapore and Los Angeles or Hong Kong and Chicago.\n", "Teledesic Inc., the communications startup mostly owned by Seattle billionaires Bill Gates and Craig McCaw, Tuesday picked Boeing Co. to build and deploy its planned $9 billion satellite network.\nBoeing also will invest up to $100 million in Teledesic, giving it a 10 percent stake in the privately-held company, which plans to launch 288 low-orbiting satellites by 2002 to form an \"Internet in the sky.\"\nTeledesic Chief Executive Officer David Twyver said the Kirkland, Wash.-based company talked to virtually all the world's major aerospace companies before settling on Seattle neighbour Boeing as prime contractor for the ambitious project.\n\"But let me say that no one company can do everything that has to be done here,\" Twyver said in an interview.\n\"We expect that most of the major aerospace and telecommunications companies if they're interested in being part of this will find room in it,\" he said.\nThe contract is a major victory for Boeing, which is counting on commercial ventures to provide growth for its rapidly expanding defence and space business\nBoeing's partly-owned Sea Launch Co. is building a mobile, ocean-based satellite launch platform, and the aerospace giant is expanding its space business aggressively through the recently completed acquisition of Rockwell International Corp. units and the planned purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n\"Our relationship with Teledesic is the perfect catalyst for bringing together all of our historical investments in the space business with our recent and planned investments in Sea Launch, Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas,\" Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit said.\nTeledesic, initially formed by McCaw, a pioneer in the cellular telephone industry, and Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., has scaled back its initial plans for a network of 840 small satellites more than 400 miles in the air, Twyver said.\nInstead, the company now plans to provide the same international coverage with a network of slightly larger satellites orbiting about twice as high above the earth -- still far lower than current communications satellites launched into geosynchronous orbit 22,500 miles up.\nTeledesic executives say their network will provide communication comparable to land-based fiber optics, including transmission of voice, data and video, between any two points on Earth equipped with the small dishes needed to link to the low-orbiting satellites.\nOther satellite projects in the works, such as Motorola Inc.'s 66-satellite Iridium project, aim to provide voice and data links to mobile users, more like today's cellular telephones.\n\"We expect our customers to be companies rather than individuals, initially at least,\" Twyver said. \"Almost every company now is putting mission-critical internal applications on Internet-style backbones, and they'll need to get access to every one of their sites.\"\nTeledesic plans to market the service directly in the United States and is in talks with major telecommunications companies overseas for resale rights.\nTwyver said Teledesic is \"very well funded\" now but will be looking for other industrial risk-sharing partners to build out the network.\nBoeing likely will build the satellites at a cost of several million dollars each on a mass-production line in its current facilities.\nUp to 16 satellites then will be packed onto each rocket for launch over an 18-month period beginning in 2001. Various launch vehicles are expected to be used.\nTwyver said the production schedule allows for an 8 percent satellite failure rate, which he said was cheaper than insuring every satellite.\nThe final configuration will include 12 \"beaded necklaces\" of 24 satellites each orbiting the Earth in different planes, with the option of adding more satellites later.\nWith the Boeing investment, Gates and McCaw each will own about one-third of Teledesic. AT&amp;T Co.'s AT&amp;T Wireless, which bought McCaw's cellular business, owns about 10 percent of Teledesic, with venture capital investors owning the rest.\n", "Russia's top aluminium smelters said on Monday attempts to fix contracts with Ukraine's main raw materials supplier had met with no success and Ukraine was instead courting a rival smelter in Tajikistan.\nRussia, chronically short of supplies of alumina, has been seeking supply contracts from Ukraine's Mykolayivsky Hlynozemny plant, with an eye to securing nearby raw materials at attractive prices.\nBut Russian metals officials said Mykolayivskiy had been reluctant so far, leaving Russia's giant Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk smelters with no alumina supplies this year from Ukraine.\n\"We have reached no agreement with Mikolayivskiy over supplies,\" said Yuri Shlaifshtein, a board member at Bratsk, the world's largest smelter.\n\"They're asking prices above world levels -- they can't go on like this much longer.\"\nMikolayivskiy's deputy commercial director, Hennady Bushtruk, earlier told Reuters in the southern Ukrainian town where the plant is based that it planned to sell 90 percent of its 1997 output to Russia but no contracts had yet been signed.\nHe declined to name prices.\nBut Shlaifshtein said the plant was asking around $270 per tonne, above world levels, and wanted to sell the bulk of its supplies to Tajikistan's Tursunzade smelter.\nMykolayivskiy is one of the largest plants of its kind in the region, with a production capacity of one million tonnes a year.\nIt takes about two tonnes of alumina to produce one tonne of primary aluminium, making Mykolayivskiy capable of supplying enough alumina to account for nearly 20 percent of Russia's 1996 output of 2.87 million tonnes.\nRussia has only two functioning alumina plants which can meet only 30 percent of smelters' demand.\nThe lack of raw materials and tight finances have given tolling a key role in the Russian aluminium industry.\nUnder tolling, smelters import raw materials, usually through international commodities houses, process them and then export them, paying back the houses with some of the proceeds.\nShlaifshtein said even Mikolayivskiy wanted to toll alumina at places like Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk rather than sell outright to Russian plants.\nMikolayivskiy, which supplied 800,000 tonnes to Russia in 1994, according to Russian news agencies, was now selling most of its supplies to Tursunzade, officials said.\nKrasnoyarsk board chairman Gennady Druzhinin and Shlaifshtein said recent talks with Mikolayivskiy had come to naught, but Bratsk and Kranosyarsk had already covered most of their alumina supplies for production this year.\n\"Their prices are too high,\" said Druzhinin.\nRussian plants usually complete talks for alumina supply contracts in December of the preceeding year.\n\"We've basically covered our supplies for the year,\" Druzhinin said. \"Bratsk has Pavlodar (the big Kazakh alumina plant), so it's easier for them.\"\nHe said Krasnoyarsk was working with London-based Trans-World Group to invest in the financially troubled Achinsk plant to boost alumina output to 700,000 tonnes this year and to have a more secure source of supplies.\n--Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520\n", "Trampling a half-century of tradition, United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich is reinventing the way the union negotiates its biggest and richest contract.\nAt every turn in the triennial ritual of labor negotiations with Detroit's Big Three automakers, Yokich has surprised industry observers with new, ground-breaking twists, such as dispensing with the traditional concept of a \"strike target.\"\nOn Tuesday, he quietly anointed Ford Motor Co. to lead the negotiations for a new contract covering over 385,000 workers. At the same time, the UAW will continue talks with General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. -- leaving the door slightly open for them to come up with a last minute offer and putting subtle pressure on Ford.\n\"Yokich is an unusually confident and bold leader,\" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California-Berkeley. \"He knows where he wants to go, and if a precedent is preventing from getting there, he throws it out.\"\nThe 61-year-old Yokich, who became the UAW's eighth president last year, has even downplayed the importance of enforcing a strict pattern agreement at all three automakers -- something held sacred by the UAW for decades.\nEvery three years since roughly the end of World War II, the UAW has selected a strike target to hammer out a pattern agreement for all three companies, with the threat of a national strike if talks run past contract's expiration.\nIn many cases, the contracts were negotiated partly through the media, with both sides publicly castigating each other.\n\"I remember back in the early to mid-80s, it was an 'I'll take whatever I can get' attitude on both sides,\" said PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward.\nBut Yokich prefers to duck the media limelight and has gone out of his way to show that he doesn't want a strike, even to the point of saying that he has banishing the word \"strike target\" from his vocabulary.\n\"Our members didn't elect us to go out on strike, they elected us to bring them an agreement,\" Yokich said last month.\nYokich, who worked as a tool and die maker before entering union politics, has a close relationship with Peter Pestillo, Ford executive vice president of corporate relations, which analysts believe will help smooth the way for a quick settlement.\nIndeed, UAW officials in recent days say that with less than two weeks to go before the contract expires Sept. 14, bargainers at all three companies are closer to agreements than at the same point in any prior negotiation year.\nThere may be other breakthroughs -- the UAW and Ford have discussed the possibility of a longer contract of up to five or six years, and Ford has shown some willingness to encourage suppliers to allow the UAW to organize their plants.\nLabor analysts said they expect him to come up with an agreement that provides some improved job security for UAW members, but will not hamstring the automakers' competitiveness.\n\"Yokich is a fairly sensible negotiator,\" Ward said. \"He has a big-picture view of the industry.\"\nHe also has a big-picture view of labor, causing him to embark last year on what may one day be viewed as his greatest accomplishment, the proposed merger of the UAW, the United Steel Workers and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers into a giant metal trades union with over 2 million members.\nRetired UAW leaders applaud Yokich's new direction and do not view him as tearing down their legacy.\n\"He's breaking out of the mold and trying something different,\" Doug Fraser, who was the UAW president in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \"In my view it can only be positive.\"\n", "Regulators Tuesday began auctioning a slice of spectrum that will let users gain access to the Internet over the airwaves or create wireless local phone networks that compete with traditional wired networks.\nTwenty-four companies -- including units of BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, Comcast Corp. and a Bell Atlantic Corp./Nynex Corp. joint venture -- are bidding for the rights to offer \"wireless communications service,\" or WCS.\nThe first day of bidding in the multi-day sale totaled $5.3 million. Analysts said recent financial problems among wireless carriers will put downward pressure on prices. It is the Federal Communication Commission's 14th airwave sale.\n\"I expect prices to go very low for this type of spectrum,\" said Elliott Hamilton, analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm.\nThe FCC is auctioning 128 licenses. Of that total, 104 are 10 megahertz licenses that roughly cover state-wide areas. The remaining 24 permits are for 5 MHz of spectrum and cover larger regional areas.\nThe FCC is not dictating what services companies can offer over this portion of the spectrum.\nPotential applications include broadband wireless access to the Internet, wireless local phone networks, and location services for pinpointing trucks and other vehicles.\nThe value of wireless spectrum has fallen after last year's $10.2 billion auction of licenses for a new generation of cellular phones known as \"personal communications services,\" or PCS.\nEdward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine, said FCC officials \"should be ecstatic\" if the agency can net $2 billion from the lastest auction.\nSeveral top bidders at the PCS sale are under financial strain after bidding high prices. Wall Street has been reluctant to invest in the ventures.\nAlso, FCC officials doubt wireless service providers can offer anytime soon the kind of mobile phone service available through PCS.\nFCC officials cite restrictions on the use of the wireless service airwaves that are meant to prevent interference among users of an upcoming digital radio service that will be broadcast coast-to-coast via satellite. The wireless service and digital radio airwaves are adjacent to one another.\nThe FCC has raised some $23 billion through its airwave sales. But the financial problems among last year's PCS winners has raised doubts over whether the government will ever collect all the money it is owed.\nPAC.N\n", "A year after the ValuJet Inc. crash, the top airline regulator suggested Thursday it would be impractical to force air carriers to install fire-safety equipment in passenger cargo holds in less than three years.\nUnder fire for not moving more quickly to promote airline safety, the Federal Aviation Administration plans next month to propose the installation of smoke detectors and fire suppressors in all passenger cargo holds over three years.\nHouse lawmakers, however, accused the agency of dragging its feet on the installation issue, despite years of warnings from safety regulators on the need to do so. Lawmakers raised the possibility of a speedier timetable.\n\"It could be done in a very short period of time if we want to ground the fleet,\" Barry Valentine, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told a House panel.\n\"That's the decision. How much disruption do we citizens want to have in our air transportation,\" he said.\nBut Representative John Fox, a Pennsylvania Republican, responded, \"I think we want to have as safe as flights as possible. And if they have to be a little slower, the public probably would like them to be a little slower.\"\nAirline executives on Wednesday announced plans to place both smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in their aircraft, after initially balking at the dual requirement.\nFAA officials came under attack at the hearing -- from both lawmakers and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -- for not moving more aggressively to implement new safety rules in the wake of the ValuJet crash.\n\"This is pathetic. The FAA is pathetic. The industry is pathetic,\" said Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat. \"Any more needless deaths and we're going to crucify you.\"\nThe FAA announced six months ago plans to issue the fire-safety equipment rules, which will affect about 3,000 aircraft. But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal.\n\"Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we're in today? Or is there really going to be improvement this time?\" asked Representative John Duncan, a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee.\nValentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the \"final assembly.\"\nValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May, killing 110 people, because of a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners.\nThe head of the NTSB disclosed this week, however, that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident.\nNTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident. Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24.\n\"It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week. You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place, that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States,\" Hall said.\nAn FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB.\n", "Labour unions at beleaguered French carmaker Renault SA called on Monday for a one-hour strike at all its factories in France, Belgium and Spain amid reports that the company will announce big job cuts.\nRenault said chairman Louis Schweitzer would this week meet representatives of a Belgian assembly plant, closure of which has already been announced, but declined comment on reports that 3,000 jobs will also go in France this year.\nThe Belgian government and the northern Flanders region also said they would sue Renault over procedural issues after European Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the group had not followed European directive on consulting unions.\nEight unions from Belgium, France and Spain called the one-hour strike and said they planned to take legal steps to thwart the decision to close the Belgain Vilvoorde plant.\n\"(We call) for a one-hour strike at all Renault sites in Belgium, Spain and France on March 7 during the day of action in the entire Belgian car industry against the Vilvoorde closure,\" the unions' statement said.\nA Renault spokeswoman said Schweitzer had agreed to meet staff this week at the Belgian plant, where 3,100 jobs will go, but the time and place had not been set.\nOn Thursday he will attend a works council meeting in Paris to face angry French workers who fear job cuts in on top of the Belgian closure.\nThe Renault spokeswoman had no comment on newspaper reports that it was preparing to announce a plan to cut about 3,000 jobs in France this year. But an industry source said somewhat fewer than 3,000 posts would go in 1997.\nRenault's troubles were highlighted by statistics showing new car sales in France slid 24.6 percent last month after tumbling 33.6 percent in January.\nThe two-month drop reflected the market's weakness since a French state rebate programme, which had underpinned demand, ended in September.\nFaced with declining demand and gross overcapacity, Renault is being forced to cut production but must do so without French government support.\nWith French unemployment at 12.7 percent and a general election due next year, the centre-right government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe has refused to back a plan to cut 40,000 jobs in the car industry over six years.\nFrench radio and newspapers gave blanket coverage to the labour dispute, with Le Figaro newspaper quoting the economy minister for Belgium's Flemish region as saying the closure was \"an act of economic terrorism\".\nThousands of workers from Renault Belgium, supported by steelworkers, marched through Brussels to protest against the shutdown which is expected to save 825 million French francs ($144 million) a year. Belgian workers called for a Renault boycott.\nBut on the French stock market, brokers said the company had to reduce output and restructure. Renault stock was down 4.02 percent at 141 francs at 1243 GMT, but that was due to profit-taking as the shares have risen 20 percent since last Wednesday.\n\"The big problem in the auto sector is overcapacity, a problem which no-one has dared to touch for 20 years for obvious labour reasons,\" said a broker. \"The fact that Renault is tackling it is a good sign.\"\nRenault shed 1,641 jobs last year and 1,735 in 1995.\nNewspapers said charges for the job-cutting plans, on top of an operating loss at the group estimated at two billion francs or more, would result in a full year loss of more than five billion francs for the group in 1996.\nThe car firm was privatised in stages in 1994 and 1996.\nRenault has four assembly plants in France, two in Spain, one in Portugal and one in Slovenia.

It's not the widely publicised polemics or legal wrangles about human rights and democracy, he says.\nFor Tsang, it's \"the end of British rule -- the end of the institutions elected under the British constitution\".\nCULTURE CLASH\nIt's a culture clash, the clashing of national prides.\nThe Chinese are fired by the desire to shake off the last vestiges of an imperialist, colonial yoke, while the British rue their loss of an empire on which, once, the sun never set.\n\"The Chinese government has never really believed the British were happy to return Hong Kong to China,\" Tsang told Reuters in an interview.\n\"Most people in Hong Kong believe Hong Kong is part of China, that the territory should return to China, that British colonial rule should come to an end.\"\nAnd end it will, at midnight June 30, when the Union Jack is furled and China's red flag is raised over a capitalist Special Administrative Region (SAR), to which China has promised a high degree of autonomy under a \"one country two systems\" principle.\nTsang Yok-sing is a man of humble working-class origins and a solid leftwing family. His parents moved to Hong Kong in 1949 as the Communists swept to power in a civil war in China. His brother, Tsang Tak-Sing, is the editor of China's propaganda mouthpiece in Hong Kong, the daily Ta Kung Pao newspaper.\nTsang is the principal of the Pui Kiu leftwing junior school in Hong Kong's North Point, once a bastion of leftwing ferment.\nHe is chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), which lost heavily to the immensely popular pro-democracy Democratic Party in legislative elections in 1995.\nThe DAB holds six seats in the elected 60-member Legislature but has scored nine seats in a provisional legislature which China plans to install on July 1 in place of the current chamber. The new body is packed with pro-China party members.\nBROTHER, SISTER JAILED DURING RIOTS\nTsang recently wrote a graphic account of his early life including his involvement in the political mayhem that rocked Hong Kong during China's Cultural Revolution.\n\"When the 1967 riots broke out I was already a committed Marxist and I was in total sympathy with the workers who were only protecting themselves against the oppressive colonial government of the time,\" Tsang wrote.\n\"I was deeply affected by the dramatic events of '67. My brother, aged 18, was arrested during the riot and locked up in Stanley Prison for two years, and my sister was imprisoned for a month, aged only 15. Don't talk to me about human rights.\"\n\"My experiences drove me more to the other side.

Although he is under siege and suffering from prostate cancer, Mobuto is clinging to power and has declared a state of emergency in the capital Kinshasa and the rest of the country.\n\"The government of Canada is not asking the president to leave the country at this time,\" Stewart said. \"Canada believes that Africans have to resolve their problems. Obviously Western-imposed solutions in this area of the world have not succeeded in the past.\"\nShe encouraged the countries around Zaire to help it resolve its problems.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Washington effectively ended a decades-old alliance with Mobutu. White House spokesman Mike McCurry said a negotiated soloution to Zaire's civil war must include agreements on interim transitional government arrangements leading ultimately to elections.\n\"That clearly reflects our view that Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history, because the support for President Mobutu is not sufficient to lead Zaire into the next chaprter of its history,\" McCurry told reporters.\nLate last year, Canadian soldiers led a multinational force into eastern Zaire to aid Rwandan refugees fleeing after a revolt by Zairean rebels.\nThe Canadian-led force was able to do little more than coordinate data from aerial searches for refugees and prepare plans for aid airdrops.\n", "Russia, the world's top aluminium exporter, is also its least competitive and alleged corruption may scare off badly-needed foreign investors, top industry sources said on Friday.\nBut the key to success was not in government intervention in the running of the industry. It should, instead, help by reducing heavy energy and transport costs, leaving it to shareholders to improve quality and expand production, they added.\nAluminium luminaries, speaking at a metallurgy conference, stepped delicately around a controversy over alleged crime in the sector. But they warned that the scandal could keep Russia's industry from becoming more competitive by discouraging investors from pumping cash into the world's largest smelters.\nIgor Prokopov, executive chairman of the Kontsern Alyuminiy producers' group, said the crime allegations were not helping matters, adding, \"it reflects negatively on our situation on world markets and puts off investors.\n\"I'll give you an example: Alcoa is buying companies in Italy and Spain but hasn't invested a copeck in Russia.\"\nComments by Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov earlier this month that Russian aluminium was plagued with corruption and that a formal probe was gathering pace come just as smelters confront the problem of how to boost profits.\nSmelter profit margins were 16 percent over 1992-1994 but had fallen to one percent in 1996 and were as low as minus 14 percent in the final quarter of last year, Prokopov said.\nLimp world prices, stagnant domestic consumption of barely three kgs per capita and soaring energy and rail tariffs -- a major component of production costs -- were to blame.\n\"Russia's aluminium sector is on the verge of crisis -- we need measures to remain competitive,\" Prokopov said.\n\"We're barely competitive on world markets. Our production costs are higher than virtually anywhere else in the world.\"\nBut he said shareholders would solve the crisis, not the government.\nVsevolod Generalov, chairman of the Metal Exporters Union and board chairman of the Norilsk Nickel metals group, said that raising output and exports was the way out of financial crisis at aluminium and other metals enterprises.\nRussia was the world's biggest primary aluminium exporter last year, with deliveries of 2.44 million tonnes. It has kept output rising steadily and forecasts growth of up to three percent this year.\nBut all is not well, with transport costs, for example, accounting for 53 percent of output costs, compared with 24 percent in the West.\nProkopov blamed five-digit increases in energy and transport tariffs since 1991, problems in recouping a 20 percent value-added tax and high taxes, which he said consumed money needed for investment and modernisation.\nThe Bratsk smelter in Siberia, the world's largest, paid 526 billion roubles ($92.2 million) to the budget last year on gross profits of 300 billion roubles, according to a Bratsk release. Profits were down sharply from 1995's 1.19 trillion roubles.\nRussian smelters also need foreign money to secure longterm electricity and transport contracts, and to integrate vertically with power generators and raw materials plants.\nTolling, in which foreign commodities houses import raw materials, send them to smelters for processing and take the metal back for export, had attracted $1.5 billion in short-term investments, the International Metallurgists Union said.\nWhile much more is needed to improve the quality of Russia's output, industry sources said the goverment was scaring off investors who were active in tolling but who might be interested in more direct investments.\n\"Some federal structures continually create artificial barriers to the adoption of this practice (tolling) which may not only undermine export possibilities but also significantly worsen the situation of the Russian raw materials base,\" a Metallurgists Union letter to President Boris Yeltsin said.\n\"Western companies who do tolling have a highly organised system of marketing and transport,\" Prokopov said, adding that tolling had saved smelters from complete collapse in recent years when they had no cash of their own to buy raw materials.\nWhile aluminium officials spoke of the need for investment, they were hesitant to slam Kulikov's comments.\n\"Kulikov's address has both positive and negative moments, and we're very attentively watching it and will send a letter (to him) soon,\" Prokopov said.\nYuri Shlaifshtein, a Bratsk board member, said there was no crime whatsoever at the

"China's largest zinc producer, Liuzhou Zinc Products Co, is tormented by water: there's either too much or too little.\nThe plant in the southern region of Guangxi struggles to stay open against fierce summer floods while low river water levels in winter often rob the factory of the hydropower it needs to keep its production lines running, officials said.\nAverage production at the plant fell to about 88 percent of capacity last year from a previous 95 percent after torrential summer rains flooded some 90 percent of the factory grounds, Jiang Wenjie, deputy director of the plant, said.\nThe high waters caused about 80 million yuan ($9.6 million) in damage and forced the closure of a zinc oxide production line for three months, Jiang told Reuters in an interview.\nDamage from the floods has since been repaired and 1997 output will rise above last year's, he said.\n\"We see output of all our products hitting 95 percent of capacity this year,\" he said.\nNo visible traces remain of last year's floods but a recent tour of the factory grounds revealed workers standing idle because a power outage had shut down all production lines.\n\"This happens often in winter because water levels are too low to generate power,\" said one official, who asked not be identified.\nThe power outages had been worked into production plans, he said.\nRISING PROFITS, SHARE LISTING SEEN IN

Jiang said, but forecast they would rise to about 21 million yuan this year.\nSales were seen at 630 million yuan in 1997, he said.\nThe company's production of zinc ingots was seen hitting 33,200 tonnes in 1997 while output of zinc oxide would top 50,000 tonnes, he said.\n\"With the development of China's automobile and construction industries...the market for zinc oxide will increase gradually,\" he said.\nChina had some 40 plants turning out 170,000 tonnes of zinc oxide annually, he said, adding that domestic demand was about 130,000 tonnes a year.\nThe smelter's output of zinc alloys would hit 1,900 tonnes in 1997, output of zinc sulphate 3,800 tonnes and that of zinc powder about 1,700 tonnes, he said.\nProduction of lithopone, used in low-grade paints, would reach 28,500 tonnes but domestic demand was expected to slump as rising living standards fuelled the market for higher quality paints, he said.\nLiuzhou Zinc had fixed assets of 250 million yuan, a registered capital of 101.5 million yuan and was 79.41 percent state-owned, Jiang said.\nThe firm had applied to list domestic currency A shares on the stock market in the southern town of Shenzhen, he said.\n\"We expect approval by the end of this year,\" he said but declined to give further details.\nEXPORT TARIFF CUT NOT HELPFUL\nJiang gave a lukewarm welcome to a recent central government decision to cut zinc export tariffs in 1997.\nBeijing's move to lower the temporary export tariff on zinc to zero in 1997 from 5.0 percent last year would have little effect on the plant's exports due to government quotas on the metal, Jiang said.\n\"Our exports won't be more than 20 percent of our output this year,\" he said.\nThat compared to exports of 45 percent of production in 1993, he said.\n\"There are still quotas on zinc exports,\" he said.\n\"The central government still has controls over the zinc industry,\" he said. \"They want to ensure domestic demand is met.\"\nEXPORTS TO GROW\nThe plant would export its products to 20 countries in 1997, he said.\nZinc oxide exports would head mainly to the United States, Japan, South Korea and southeast Asia, Jiang said but declined to give further details.\nChina produced about 1.07 million tonnes of zinc last year, down 0.32 percent from 1995, official figures show. Zinc output in December alone was 94,900 tonnes.\nDomestic zinc demand is seen hitting 870,000 tonnes in 1997, up 6.1 percent from last year, the figures show.\nThe smelter sourced about 85 percent of its supply of zinc concentrate from mines in Guangxi, the southern province of Guangdong and Yunnan province in the southwest, he said.\nThe plant would not import zinc concentrate within the next five years, he said.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n", "The Czech cabinet will adopt a carrot-and-stick package mixing investment incentives with budget and import cuts in an attempt to spur economic growth, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Tuesday.\nWith the cabinet due to announce a stimulus package on Wednesday, share market reforms and savings promotion steps to reduce demand were most frequently mentioned as likely to be included by the nine analysts surveyed.\nThe government has said it aims to reduce growing budget and trade deficits, while spurring growth, dampening demand for imports and adding confidence to beleaguered capital markets.\nNone of the analysts expected a direct manipulation of the exchange rate to help exports, although several suggested allowing the crown to ease below its corridor of plus/minus 7.5 percent from the mid-point of a mark/dollar basket.\nJosef Poeschl at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies said lower interest rates were needed, but Merrill Lynch's Andrew Kenningham expected lower rates would be put off until more data on slowing growth was available.\nThere was a consensus among the analysts that the cabinet should take steps to beef up market regulation, with most saying a U.S.-style Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would help revive lagging foreign investment.\nThe analysts agreed sharp budget cuts were on the cards, as economic growth, and thus tax revenue, has come up short.\nExpectations ranged from 20 billion crowns ($654 million) in cuts seen as \"very likely\" by Boris Gomez and Susanne Hallergard at ING Barings to 40-50 billion forecast by Kenningham.\n\"At least 25 billion crowns of cuts are needed to give good chance of a balanced budget,\" said Kennigham. \"Anything short of a balanced budget lacks credibility.\"\nThere was a broad consensus that state sector wages would be capped at 10 percent nominal growth -- Kenningham said that should save about 30 billion crowns this year -- and several expected pressure on the private sector to follow suit.\nKamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka, said the government should seek a budget surplus of two to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but more likely would move toward just a balance.\nJanacek, who works at the largest state-controlled bank, said the government must finish privatising big banks and industrial corporations.\nHe said he expected the issuing of longer-term government bonds to increase the propensity to save in the household sector and for changes in the legal and institutional framework to enable better functioning of the legal infrastructure.\nSeveral said they expected longer-term state bonds to be issued to attract individual Czech retail investors to park their money for awhile, reducing demand.\nThe group was mixed on the need to impose surcharges or quotas to reduce demand for imports, which have thrown the current account deficit to more than 8.5 percent of GDP.\nGomez and Hallergard said they expected seasonal import duties on selected foodstuffs and more stringent non-tariff trade barriers on imports, particularly from the European Union, in the package.\nPoeschl said he expected some non-tariff barriers would be introduced on selected items, adding they should be for a defined period of time with plans for a gradual removal.\nOther key comments included:\n* Martin Kupka at Prague's Patria Finance said he expected \"considerable\" budget cuts, anti-import administrative measures and a rise in consumption taxes to dampen demand.\n* Matt Starr, bond trader at Creditanstalt Prague, said he expected a cap on wages, budget cuts, a move to separate investment funds from banks -- an often-cited problem in the capital markets -- and more support for the Export Guarantee and Insurance agency (EGAP) and state export bank.\n($ = 30.58 Czech Crowns)\n", "Bell Atlantic Corp. said Thursday its earnings rose sharply in the first quarter, boosted by growth in its telephone and cellular businesses.\nThe Philadelphia-based telecommunications company reported first-quarter net income of $515.6 million, an increase of 11.0 percent over the $464.7 million it earned in first quarter of 1996. Earnings per share rose to $1.17 from $1.06, slightly more than the First Call consensus estimate of $1.16.\nOperating revenues grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion.\n\"This was a good solid set of numbers,\" J.P.

After the restatement, first-quarter 1996 net income was $606.8 million, but investors focused on the company's actual operating results.\nBell Atlantic's stock gained $1 to $60.25 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe latest earnings report consolidates the results of the Mexican Grupo Iusacell SA de CV investment for the first time following Bell Atlantic's assumption of operational control of the business in February.

We need to come up with a helpful programme to train people and raise their quality. Otherwise, we will have no resources to expand our economy.\"\nAn exploding service sector scrambling to meet the demands of the awakening Chinese economic giant has created a huge demand for properly qualified people in Hong Kong.\nInvestment bankers snowed under by listing applications from Chinese companies constantly complain they cannot find qualified workers, allowing barely-skilled expatriates to walk into highly-paid jobs far beyond their grasp back home.\nThe demand for all types of service professionals, such as lawyers, accountants, doctors, traders, analysts and others, has skyrocketed, putting upward pressure on overall wage rates and fuelling inflation.\nThe shortage can only get worse. China's economy is expected to double in size over the next decade, and Hong Kong's school system is unequipped to meet the new demand.\nA shortage of school space is forcing Hong Kong's future workforce to attend school in shifts, and studies show Hong Kong students score lower in mathematics and science tests than rivals elsewhere in Asia.\nThis problem threatens to turn into a crisis within the decade, Leung warned. Under current circumstances, Hong Kong will be unable to find sufficient expatriates to meet its needs, possibly allowing centres such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo to step in to meet demand.\nStandards of English, the language of international commerce, are already considered to be lower in Hong Kong than in Singapore.\nThey will worsen further following the reversion of sovereignty to China on July 1, with an increasing emphasis on Mandarin as the common language of China rather than English, a legacy of a period considered shameful to China.\n\"We have got to place more emphasis on this otherwise we will be at a disadvantage,\" Leung said.\nAnybody who doubted the importance of English to Hong Kong needed only turn to Tokyo, said Leung, where a lack of language ability had caused Japan to lag Hong Kong and Singapore as an Asia-Pacific financial centre, despite Japan's bigger markets.\nHong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa has appointed a special task force to review the education system, which Leung said was a good idea.\n\"At least they know it is one of the most important factors affecting Hong Kong,\" Leung said.\nBut he is waiting to see what recommendations surface, calling for practical steps to massively upgrade the labour force's skill sets to match Hong Kong's new economic identity.\n-- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6470\n", "Netscape Communications Corp will on Monday map out a vision on how companies will be able to use its products in the future to coordinate activities between themselves and customers, partners, suppliers and distributors.\nWhile much of the hype surrounding the advent of the World Wide Web has been devoted to new media opportunities, the area with the biggest payback involves a vast network of secured interconnections between companies using Internet technology.  \nInternet analysts and investors in the technologies now expect the market for this variety of electronic commerce to far outstrip even their most upbeat projections for expansion of merchandising and advertising over the Web.\nAnd for software providers such as Internet pioneer Netscape, the market could be even larger than the $10 billion that independent research firms are projecting the Intranet software market may grow to be by the year 2000.  \nMarc Andreessen, Netscape's co-founder and senior vice president of technology, has been talking since the middle of last year about the prospective new market for these so-called \"Extranets\" -- external networks of interlinked corporate Intranets.\n\"Extranets could actually be bigger than Intranets. We'll see,\" Andreessen told Reuters. \"The reason is because if there's 10,000 Intranets out there, then there's 10,000 squared possible connections between them, every one of which is going to involve software.\"  \n\"Right now, if a company wants to build an Extranet between two Intranets, they have to do a lot of work at the network level,\" Andreessen said.\nWith Netscape's software, companies can provide partners with access to parts of their Intranet, making it easier to communicate on projects, he said.\nNetscape, which supplies the world's most popular Internet browser, hopes to develop what it calls \"Crossware\" -- on-demand software applications that run across a multitude of networks and operating systems.  \nNetscape said its own next-generation products -- a client's software for computer users dubbed Mercury and a suite of server products codenamed Apollo -- will be available in early 1998.\nThe announcement is part of a flurry of product introductions expected this week at the industry's Internet World trade show in Los Angeles, and weeks before the final release of Netscape's Communicator package of Internet software, incorporating browsing, electronic mail and group collaboration features.  \nNetscape also hopes its Actra Business Systems joint venture with a division of General Electric Co, will help build products for business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets.\nActra is releasing products before mid-year which will enable electronic data interchange over the Internet, Andreessen said.\nIn a bid to seed this new market, Andreessen said Netscape plans as early as this summer to release a new development tool codenamed Palomar to help developers build crossware applications.\nFor Netscape, the potential Extranet market could be a huge boon. It also promises to be no cakewalk, with rivals Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp's Lotus Development Corp reaching into their own deep pockets to compete aggressively in the field.\nBut Netscape hopes to continue to push its leadership role in Internet software and has lined up partnerships with more than 35 companies around a core set of standards for Extranets.\n", "The presumed death of geologist Michael de Guzman, who helped discover Indonesia's rich Busang gold site, on Wednesday shocked fellow prospectors and highlighted the dangers of their profession.\nDe Guzman, chief geologist for Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd, fell out of a helicopter as he was returning to the Busang mine site in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province.\nRescue crews were still searching the dense Borneo jungle for 41-year-old Filipino's body after he fell about 800 feet from the helicopter.\n\"It's very tragic and he will be remembered as a fine geologist,\" Bre-X Minerals chief executive David Walsh said in a telephone interview.\nDe Guzman was a key member of the team which discovered Busang -- the richest gold find this century -- a few years ago. Bre-X has since agreed to develop the Busang site, valued at US$25 billion, with U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc and Indonesian partners.\n\"He (de Guzman) was a very respected geologist and well respected within the mining community,\" said Mario Steiner, president of Aerodat Inc, a geological survey company.\nBre-X's stock was halted for several hours on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday before Bre-X issued a statement.\nThe company's stock closed down 0.40 at 17.25 on volume of 5.2 million shares.\nBre-X senior vice-president of exploration John Felderhof, who is currently in North America, will return to Indonesia, Walsh said.\nThis is the latest tragedy involving Canadian mining and exploration companies in far-flung corners of the world.\nIn October 1995, nine employees of Saskatoon-based Cameco Corp were killed in a helicopter crash in Kyrgyzstan.\nThe Kyrgyzstan Air helicopter, chartered by a Cameco unit, was en route from the Kumtor gold mine when it went down.\nThe families of the nine Canadians killed in the crash have said they plan to file a C$20.7 million lawsuit alleging Cameco and other defendants were negligent.\nAirborne surveyor Aerodat Inc has lost three aircraft since 1994, the latest in the dense eastern Amazon jungle of Peru.\nIn September 1996, Falconbridge Ltd chief executive Franklin Pickard died of a heart attack while visiting the company's copper site high in Chile's Andes Mountains.\n\"It puts you in circumstances that maybe other jobs wouldn't put you in, but the industry has very high safety standards,\" said Tony Andrews, executive director of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada.\n\"With the number of miles travelled and so on, there are bound to be accidents, but I don't think our industry is any different from others that are global in nature,\" he said.\n((Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100))\n", "China said on Sunday it will tighten inspections of imported animals and plants next year for possible diseases after Chinese quarantine officials banned poultry imports from several U.S. states and a part of Britain.\n\"The country's animal and quarantine authorities will carry out stricter inspection on a wide range of goods,\" the China Daily Business Weekly newspaper said.\nInspections would cover imports and exports of plants, animals, fruit and agricultural goods, as well as containers, packages and other materials used to transport them, according to new regulations approved this month by the State Council, or cabinet.\nQuarantine and customs officials would inspect both hand-carried items as well as goods imported or exported by traders, the newspaper said.\nPets and plants of diplomats who have diplomatic immunity would also have to be inspected, it said.\nThe authorities could slap fines of up to 50,000 yuan ($6,000) on violators, the newspaper said.\nAgricultural officials would be on the lookout for animal and plant diseases at home and abroad, it said.\nLast week, China announced a ban on poultry imports from Missouri and Oklahoma, alleging that five cases of Newcastle disease were discovered in the two U.S. states between July and September.\nThe United States denied the accusation and said it sought talks with China to lift the ban.\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said the disease broke out in pet birds only, and that all the pet birds infected with the disease were destroyed.\nThe spokeswoman said she had no information on which U.S. states found pet birds with Newcastle disease or when the problems were discovered.\nThe newspaper said China banned in July poultry imports from an unidentified area of Britain it believed was affected by Newcastle disease.\nIn October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza. But the ban did not go into effect after China and the United States held talks on the issue.\nChina is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products.\nSome 330,000 tonnes of U.S. poultry products -- worth $445 million -- were exported to China through Hong Kong last year, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.\nEvery day, 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China, the council said.\nBeijing and Washington are also at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector.\nChina had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China.\nBeijing said it was delaying by one month the implementation of those curbs, which had been scheduled to take effect December 10, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.\n", "Gendis Inc will post \"extensive\" losses in fiscal 1998 after its Greenberg Stores Ltd unit was forced into bankruptcy with almost 1,500 layoffs, President Allan MacKenzie said on Tuesday.\nAsked in an interview what impact Gendis would feel for the year ending in late January 1998, MacKenzie told Reuters: \"Extensive. Multi-millions.\" He declined to elaborate.\nMacKenzie said that the losses from the bankruptcy would be reported separately from ongoing operating results.\nWinnipeg-based Gendis said on Tuesday that Greenberg, one of its two wholly owned retail arms, declared bankruptcy and sold 89 of its 169 stores to the other unit SAAN Stores Ltd, resulting in the closing of 80 stores and about 1,500 layoffs.\nMacKenzie added that Gendis would take the largest loss among Greenberg's creditors after acting as its chief banker.\nGreenberg's Montreal headquarters would be shuttered and 60 of its 322

scoop.\nChina jailed him for stealing state secrets as a warning and then freed him when it needed a chip to smoothe choppy waters as its plans for governing Hong Kong ran into a storm.\nAfter two of the more difficult weeks so far in China's march toward its July 1 resumption of sovereignty over the British colony of Hong Kong, Beijing abruptly freed Xi Yang on Saturday from a 12-year sentence for spying and stealing state secrets.\n\"There really isn't much room for any other interpretation,\" said one Western diplomat in Beijing.\n\"They needed to make a gesture to Hong Kong to show they cared about human rights and releasing Xi Yang was probably one of the easiest ways to do that -- and at very little cost.\"\nBeijing prison authorities notified Xi Yang at 8.00 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Saturday morning that he was being released on parole, and 12 hours later he arrived in Hong Kong -- a free man for the first time since his arrest in October 1993.\nXi was paroled because he \"showed signs of repentance\", the official Xinhua news agency said, but gave no more details.\nChina viewed his article in the Hong Kong Ming Bao newspaper on Beijing's interest rate policy and its gold reserves as a theft of state secrets and central bank clerk Tian Ye was jailed for 15 years for leaking the information.\nDiplomats said the harsh sentence against Xi Yang had served its purpose both as a warning to the free and feisty media in Hong Kong as to limits on their coverage after Beijing resumes sovereignty and to stop reporters from uncovering news not published in the state-run Chinese media.\n\"By locking him up they made their point about press freedoms,\" said one Asian diplomat.\n\"Whether they jailed him for two years or 50 years, it doesn't matter because they have succeeded in reinforcing the notion to Hong Kong journalists that they can't export their press freedoms into China,\" he said.\n\"They have made their point that 'don't think you can have it your way',\" he said.\nThe timing of Xi's parole was no coincidence, diplomats diplomats said.\n\"It's been a tough couple of weeks for them over Hong Kong, and here was a gesture of reconciliation they could make at very little cost,\" the Western diplomat said.\nChina and Hong Kong's outgoing colonial masters have become embroiled in a row over Beijing's plans to dilute civil liberties by rolling back the Bill of Rights and laws on freedom of association in Hong Kong after the handover.\nChina's decision aroused protest in Hong Kong and sparked expressions of concern from the United States.\nXi Yang's release Yang offered an opportunity to Beijing to demonstrate to Hong Kong it can be flexible on human rights, diplomats said.\nBeijing has found from past experience that releasing a dissident at strategic moments can smoothe the path of international diplomacy.\nChina freed veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng in 1993 when it was vying to win the 2000 Olympic Games and

reversing the steady decline of Snapple sales passed Thursday from Quaker Oats Co, which couldn't pull it off, to a firm that rescued the similar Mistic beverage line last year, but which is itself in transition.\nIn agreeing to acquire Snapple for $300 million in cash, Triarc Cos Inc took on a task at which Quaker labored for 2-1/2 years without success. At the same time, Triarc's deal cast a new light on its pending plans to spin off its beverage and fast-food businesses, analysts said.  \nBuying Snapple could affect the proposed spinoff of Mistic, Royal Crown soft drinks and Arby's restaurants into a new company, said Triarc spokesman Martin Shea. \"We're waiting for an IRS ruling\" on the spinoff, he said.\nThe effect could be a plus, said analysts, who suggested the deal shows Triarc is serious about making sense out of its jumble of assets and becoming a player in consumer brands.\n\"This new management team at Triarc is damn good,\" said Wheat First Butcher Singer food industry analyst John Maxwell.\nBased in New York, Triarc was pieced together during the anything-goes junk-bond era by Victor Posner, analysts said.  \nPosner exited when Triarc was taken over by financiers Nelson Peltz and Peter May in 1993. They have since followed a course of asset redistribution aimed at rationalizing Triarc's businesses and attracting more Wall Street attention.\nIn the past four years, Triarc has gained new respect, sold 16 businesses, paid off $500 million in debt and raised $200 million in cash, Shea said.\nThe firm bought Mistic for $95 million in 1995. In 1996, the juice line posted sales of $130 million. Triarc's Royal Crown soft drink line had 1996 sales of about $175 million, said Triarc beverage chief executive Michael Weinstein.  \n\"We know how to make a brand succeed,\" Weinstein said.\nThat knowledge will be needed to turn around Snapple. The brand virtually invented the premium soft drink category, and it remains the market leader. But Snapple sales have declined every year since 1994. Last year, they were $551 million, down eight percent from 1995, Quaker reported.\nQuaker, the Chicago-based food giant, acquired Snapple in December 1994 near the height of its popularity for $1.8 billion, including acquisition costs. The sale price agreed to this week with Triarc will force Quaker to post a $1.4 billion one-time loss in its first quarter.  \n\"The (Snapple) investment's been a disaster\" for Quaker, said Prudential Securities food analyst John McMillin.\nWall Street treated Quaker kindly Thursday, however, following the announcement of the sale, reflecting some relief that the company finally sold off the money-losing unit.\nShares in Quaker -- which retains such crown jewel products as Gatorade and several cereal brands -- closed up 1/4 at 37-3/4.

Starwave employees also own shares.\nStarwave was founded by Allen and Slade in 1993, before the Internet emerged as a commercial publishing platform. The company explored interactive television before developing content for proprietary online services and CD-ROMs.\n\"Then the Web came along,\" said Slade, who credited the company's chief technology officer Patrick Naughton and Progressive Networks founder Rob Glaser with persuading him to adopt an Internet business plan.\nStarwave launched its sports product in late 1994 and signed the deal with ESPN -- now mostly owned by Disney -- the following spring.\nThe ESPNet site is considered one of the Web's most popular and one of the few mainstream areas that charge for access.\nWhile basic sports results and information are free of charge, Slade said about 100,000 people pay to play in fantasy leagues or gain access to premium information at $4.95 a month.\nStarwave also operates Mr. Showbiz, a well-regarded entertainment site, as well as a site for parents and children and official sites for professional football, basketball and auto racing.\nSlade said Starwave's experience producing ESPNet would help in creating innovative features for the ABC News site.\nDespite competition with virtually every major news organization including CNN, USA Today and NBC's joint venture with Microsoft, Slade was optimistic Disney could make money in news.\n\"One of the things about Disney that makes them the ideal partner is they never do things in a lackadaisical way,\" Slade said. \"They marshal all the corporate resources and really make it happen.\"\n", "China on Monday crowed over an economic triumph in restraining inflation while retaining strong growth in 1996, and said it expected to do even better next year despite soaring state sector losses and slumping incomes.\nChina's gross domestic product was estimated to have grown 9.7 percent in 1996 to 6,780 billion yuan ($816 billion), with inflation slashed to 6.0 percent from 14.8 percent in 1995, the State Statistical Bureau quoted preliminary figures as showing.\nDespite soaring losses in the lumbering state sector and falling incomes for many urban households, the statistics showed China's economy had returned safely to earth after a period of high-inflation runaway growth, said bureau spokesman Ye Zhen.\n\"The national economy maintained its rapid and stable growth, indicating a successful 'soft landing',\" Ye told a news conference in Beijing.\nChina would do even better in 1997, he said.\n\"Preliminary estimates show overall growth will continue with the same stability and high speed as this year,\" he said.\nAnnual economic growth in 1997 was expected to rise to 10.5 percent, while inflation -- which soared to a communist-era high of 21.4 percent in 1994 -- would stay at this year's level, Ye said.\nChina had set a target of 8.0 percent growth for 1996 to try to cool the economy, down from 10.2 percent last year and a sizzling 11.8 percent the previous year.\nThe 6.0 percent figure for 1996 retail price inflation, China's benchmark price index, was well below the government's 10 percent target for the year.\nConsumer price inflation was estimated at about 8.3 percent, compared with 17.1 percent in 1995.\nWhile some economists have expressed doubts about the accuracy of Beijing's inflation figures, it was clear that once-fierce price rises had been largely controlled, said Jason Kwok, chief economist at Citibank Hong Kong and China.\n\"It all tends to suggest that the macro-economy is doing very well this year,\" Kwok said in a telephone interview.\nTwo recent interest rate cuts and China's second-half turnaround of an earlier poor export performance meant growth could edge up next year even without a loosening of Beijing's 42-month-old tight credit policy, Kwok said.\nStable growth next year was likely to receive an external boost from an expected upward trend in exports, which the statistical bureau said had powered China to an estimated $16 billion trade surplus in 1996, he said.\nBeijing would keep the lid on credit growth and continue to put high priority on restraining price rises, Ye said.\nSome economists have suggested Beijing's success in reducing inflation and the two cuts in interest rates this year signal an imminent easing of the credit crunch, which has thrown a heavy burden on the already struggling state enterprises.\nAbout 75 percent of state firms were losing money and total losses in the government

Judiciary Committee approved the measure.\nThe bill, known as the Security and Freedom through Encryption Act, now goes to the House International Relations Committee where opponents plan to make their stand.\nEncryption, computer programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key,\" has become an essential component of global communications and electronic commerce over the Internet.\nThe Clinton administration has opposed the bill and similiar measures in the Senate, arguing that allowing strong encryption out of the country will put it in the hands of international criminals and terrorists.\nRepresentative Bob Goodlatte, the bill's author, said he had spoken to administration officials on Tuesday and hoped a compromise could be reached.\n\"We're very, very close in many areas,\" the Virginia Republican told reporters after the committee vote. \"The export control issue is probably the area that we're still the furthest apart on.\"\nGoodlatte's bill would also write into law the current policy of allowing unrestricted domestic use of encryption.\nThe bill would criminalize the use of encryption to conceal information related to the commission of a felony. That provision came on an amendment from Massachusetts Democrat Representative William Delahunt which replaced a broader criminalization provision included in the original bill.\nThe committee also approved an amendment requiring law enforcement officials to compile statistics for Congress on the use of encryption by criminals.\nSoftware industry officials and privacy advocates, who have strongly opposed the export limits, urged lawmakers to continue moving the legislation forward.\nThe International Relations Committee \"will have a go at it but it's great to have some momentum,\" Netscape Communications Corp. public policy counsel Peter Harter said after the vote. \"We've come a long way in a very short period of time. This legislation is moving at Internet time.\"\nJonah Seiger, communications director at the Centre for Democracy and Technology, said the vote was a \"historic moment.\"\n\"The Judiciary Committee agreed that the administration has the wrong policy sending a very clear signal that we need to change direction,\" Seiger said.\nBefore the vote, committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois prohibited amendments to the bill on the controversial export section.

Consumers will also be able to access the network via the Internet or any commercial online service.\nElectronic commerce, in which consumers buy goods and services via computer, could grow to $600 billion a year within 10 years, Gerstner said. By contrast, electronic commerce now runs at only about $700 million a year, he said.\n\"The demand is there,\" Barnett Banks Inc. Chief Executive Charles Rice told the news conference.\nGerstner said he hoped that companies like Intuit Inc., which has its own set of deals with banks for electronic banking software, will develop versions of its popular Quicken personal financial software for Integrion.\nIn addition to Barnett, banks teaming up with IBM include BankAmerica Corp., the Royal Bank of Canada, Fleet Financial Group Inc. and Banc One Corp.\nIntegrion will be owned and operated by the member banks and IBM. It will be open to all banks in North America.\nGerstner said his company would make money from the venture by selling the services of its Global Network and other services. He said Integrion is a for-profit company but that the companies involved will make money through electronic banking services.\nGerstner was not specific on what kind of revenues IBM or any of the companies involved were expecting from the venture.\nThe companies said they will use the IBM Global Network as the base network for electronic banking, a proprietary network maintained by IBM and used by many corporations as their own network or to conduct commerce with other companies.\nSeveral bankers attending the news conference said the partnership with IBM would lower the cost of developing technology for electronic banking.\nThe companies said the most sensitive banking transactions will run over the IBM network, which they said is more secure than the Internet, but with connections to the Net.\nGerstner said while the Internet has become a totally new communications medium in the past two years, it is still not yet the \"holy grail\" companies have hoped for.\n\"The payoff is what these institutions do with this,\" Gerstner said.\nOther banks teaming up with IBM are ABN AMRO Bank NV, Comerica Inc., First Bank System Inc., First Chicago NBD Corp., KeyCorp., Mellon Bank Corp., Michigan National Corp., NationsBank Corp., PNC Bank and Washington Mutual Savings Bank.\n", "Anti-Japanese sentiment is surfacing in Hong Kong, fuelled by a row over a group of South China Sea islands and a wave of nationalist feeling in China.\nActivists and World War Two survivors with bitter memories of atrocities committed by Japan have staged a spate of anti-Japanese protests over the past month in the British colony, set to revert to Chinese sovereignty next July 1.\nThe latest protest on Friday highlighted how anger against Japan is uniting Chinese in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan -- pulling together even groups whose political differences usually keep them at loggerheads with each other.\nFor the first time, China's mission in Hong Kong opened its doors to its arch-foes the Democratic Party, who handed over a petition calling for Beijing to take action against Japan. The democrats arrived at the door soon after a pro-Beijing group.\nAnti-Japanese editorials appeared in nearly all Hong Kong newspapers on Friday attacking Japan's claim to the Diaoyu Islands, which are also claimed by Beijing and Taipei.\nAnti-Japanese demonstrations have become practically a daily occurrence, and local activists are trying to organise a ship to take them to the islands next month to demolish a lighthouse and war memorial erected by Japanese rightists.\nThe English-language Hong Kong Standard lauded the activists' \"courage, determination and optimism.\"\n\"Their cause is a just one. These islands have been Chinese territory since 1534,\" it said.\nOn Thursday, demonstrators handed over a protest note at the Japanese consulate, but Consul-General Hideaki Ueda said they were making a mountain out of a molehill.\n\"I sincerely hope that the concerned people do not make this issue an artificially big issue,\" Ueda said.\nHe said Japan's navy would take the \"necessary measures\" to halt anybody trying to land on the islands, which Japan calls the Senkakus.\nThe Chinese-language Ming Pao, recalling Japan's past imperialism, said China's history was a stark reminder that tolerating invasion only encouraged worse aggression.\n\"If Japan did not change its attitude on the islands, it would become the biggest threat to the security of Asia in the 21st Century,\" the paper said.\nA Taiwan group said on Thursday that they would sail a private fishing boat to the islands, while 31 Chinese journalists in Beijing demanded Tokyo tear down the lighthouse.\nBut the Hong Kong Economic Journal, published in Chinese, said Hong Kong people showed more patriotic fervour on the issue than the communist government in Beijing, which it said offered only rhetorical condemnation.\n\"It is clear China has no intention of taking any action against Japan to reassert its sovereignty over the islands, as this might jeopardise vital Japanese investment,\" it said.\nOther newspapers recently published exhortations to China to send in its navy to assert sovereignty over the islands.\nOver the past few months, several articles also appeared in Hong Kong media recalling Japan's World War Two occupation of Hong Kong and war atrocities committed by Japanese imperial forces against the Chinese population on the mainland.\nThe prospect of British-ruled Hong Kong returning to China next year and Portuguese-run Macau two years later is a point of patriotic pride on the mainland. Hong Kong people talk of this with pride, too, despite some anxiety about becoming subjects of communist Beijing.\n", "Growth in fast-food, snacking and eating out in Britain is driving profits at food retailer Watson &amp; Philip, owners of the 526-strong chain of Alldays convenience stores, chief executive Colin Glass said on Wednesday.\nAnd the trend shows no sign of abating, he said.\n\"What is happening is there has been a major demographic shift with an increasing number of single occupancy household or households where both people work. Customers are spending more on prepared food rather than food they cook at home,\" Glass said in an interview.\nThe company's shares soared 44p to 389p on Wednesday, making it the stockmarket's biggest climber.

As a result the company has adopted two strategies aimed at achieving profits growth.\nFirst to change the product mix to bring in more videos, fast food and drinks -- grocery and household goods now make up less than a quarter of Alldays's range -- and secondly to open more stores, said Glass.\nThe company plans to open about 150 more Alldays stores in 1997 mainly in the midlands and northern England and by the millenium Glass said the Alldays network of stores would be increased to 1,000.\nWatson &amp; Philip also plan to put Dunkin' Donuts into 60 of its stores over the next month, said Glass. The company will franchise Dunkin' Donuts from its owner Allied Domecq. The company is also currently testing the Domino Pizza brand with its customers in six stores.\nGlass said the company had a medium term target of seven percent margins at its 286 company-owned stores, adding that margins at its 240 franchised outlets were likely to remain at current levels.\nW&amp;P has a franchise agreement with Total Oil Ltd which will lead to over 50 Total-owned petrol stations incorporating Alldays stores, at Total's cost, over the next year.\nAnalysts had downgraded their profit forecasts for the company's full-year results after it issued a profits warning in October, sending its shares down almost 40p on the day.\nAt the time market forecasts ranged from 18.5 million to 21.8 million pounds.\n($1=.6035 Pound)\n", "SBC Warburg, the investment banking arm of Swiss Bank Corp, said on Wednesday it had been forced to take a loss on a 300 million pound ($478 million) share deal which is being investigated by Britain's financial markets watchdog.\nThe deal, the liquidation of part of the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust(KEPIT), is thought to have lost SBC Warburg around two million pounds and led to the resignation of Peter Corrigan, head of French equities, who left the firm last Friday.\nBritain's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) confirmed on Wednesday that it is probing the deal.\n\"I can confirm that SFA is formally investigating SBC Warburg,\" an SFA spokesman said, adding he could make no further comment.\nSBC, which announced its 1996 results on Wednesday, did not include a special provision for the loss but executive Marcel Ospel said in Basle that the bank was supporting the investigation \"in every way.\"\nAn SBC Warburg spokesman told Reuters the firm  had ensured that KEPIT had not been disadvantaged as a result of a share sale.\nThe spokesman said that in connection with a bid for three of KEPIT's portfolios last October, \"the bank sought to sell into the market\" and that this had contributed to adverse price movements of the shares in the portfolios.\nThe fall in the share prices meant KEPIT might have received less than it had expected for the sale but SBC Warburg said it had ensured that the client did not lose out -- effectively taking the loss, thought to be around two million pounds, onto its own book.\nBanking sources said the SFA investigation centred on the sharp fall of several European share prices on October, after SBC Warburg carried out the share sales for KEPIT.\nThe sources said SBC Warburg is denying allegations of market manipulation and is putting the loss down to an error in its attempt to hedge itself.\nIt appears this operation was mis-timed and Warburg was punished by the market, later agreeing to book the deal at the price which KEPIT had expected to receive.\nShare markets on the day in question, October 30, 1996, were volatile after the Bank of England had raised British interest rates.\nThe Warburg spokesman said its compliance officials had been notified at once of the deal and had started their own internal investigation.\nSources said the SFA has a duty to investigate the background to such market events, usually as a result of being notified by one of the parties involved.\n($ = 0.627 British Pounds)\n", "Throngs of people flocked on Wednesday to a trade fare unveiling the latest personal security gadgets in a country where kidnapping and drug gangs are rampant.\nThe entry fee for the two-day Expo Seguridad fair was $285.

He became an adviser to the company, and chairman Masashi Suzuki took over his position while retaining the chairmanship.\nNomura, one of the world's most powerful financial institutions, is involved in bond and share trading.\nIt exerts a powerful influence on every business in the yen bond market and is also Japan's top foreign bond seller.\nThe company has seen key foreign and domestic clients suspend business with it since the scandal broke.\nNomura has been a key player in Japanese financial markets for most of this century, including underwriting firms such as Sony Corp, which were part of Japan's postwar economic miracle.\nIn a scene akin to a Japanese film, 90 officials in business suits, led by a man with a briefcase, marched military-style through the front doors of Nomura's modernistic headquarters.\nThey firmly locked the doors, shutting out journalists gathered for a raid designed to have maximum publicity value.\nReports that the raids were imminent hit Nomura's share price, which ended the day down 20 yen (16 cents) at 1,440 ($11.70).\nBut brokers said the impact of the news was limited as the market had expected such a development.\n\"What the market is more concerned about is any punitive measures which will be taken against the brokerage,\" said Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager.\n\"The punishment will probably have an effect on the firm's business and could have an impact on the whole brokerage industry as well,\" Ueki said.\nThe investigation comes six years after Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients.\nTop executives at Nomura resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters.

Some costs would be offset by a stronger yen.\nThose analysts forecasting 1997 earnings at HK$3.6 billion were holding steady while those with higher estimates of HK$4.0 billion or above were expected to make downward revisions.\nAt a news conference on Monday the company declined comment on expected losses.\nThe engine failure is the latest blow for Cathay, which also faces labour unrest and a decline in Japanese tourism heading into what had expected to be a strong summer as travellers flock in for the territory's July 1 handover to China..\n\"That (Japanese tourism) would be a bigger factor than the loss of the engines,\" said Mark Simpson at Schroder Securities.\nAnalysts said Cathay's problems started with a strike in 1993 and culminated with China National Aviation Corp's (CNAC) threat last year to compete directly with Cathay in Hong Kong.\nIn a compromise deal, CNAC instead bought 36 percent of Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair), mostly from Cathay Pacific and Swire Pacific Ltd\nOne of Hong Kong's oldest British \"hongs\" or trading houses, Swire owns 44 percent of Cathay with another 25 percent held by China's CITIC Pacific Ltd Swire and Cathay together hold about 26 percent of Dragonair.\nChina's evident interest in grabbing a piece of Hong Kong's lucrative aviation sector has cast a cloud over Cathay's future.\n\"What will the competitive picture be in Hong Kong (after Hong Kong reverts to China on July 1),\" asked Fernow. \"One can conclude it's not going to get better, it's going to get worse. The extent to which they will get routes in China is not known.\"\nIf it does, Cathay will be competing against Dragonair, persuading some analysts to forecast a disposal of Cathay's stake in the airline.

Boeing is one of 30 stocks in the index of blue-chip companies.\nIndustry analysts estimated the move by the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, announced late on Monday, could reduce Boeing's research and development costs by more than $2 billion over the next five years and boost annual earnings by as much as $1 a share.\nNatWest Securities analyst Nick Heymann said the decision not to proceed with the risky project removed a cloud of uncertainty over Boeing as it ramps up production to meet rising demand and prepares to complete its planned $14 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n\"It's fantastic news,\" he said.\nWhile officials at Boeing rival Airbus Industrie said the European consortium would go ahead with plans for an all-new superjumbo jetliner called the A-3XX, Heymann said he thought that project was dead.\n\"Airbus never really had the resources to go ahead with their aircraft,\" Heymann said.\nHe said it was even less likely the European consortium could raise the funds now that Boeing has talked with the same customers and determined market conditions did not justify the investment needed for a new big jet.\nBoeing said it would cost more than $7 billion just to develop a new wing and make other changes needed to produce two new versions of the 747 that would add range and capacity.\nAirbus has said it can develop and all-new jet for $8 billion, but analysts peg the total costs at closer to a whopping $15 billion.\nCiting increasing \"route fragmentation,\" especially across the Pacific Ocean, Boeing said it plans to focus its development efforts on new versions of the medium-sized 767 and 777 twin-engine models.\nBoeing already has begun offering an increased-capacity version of the 767 that could be launched with an initial order in the next few months.\nBoeing also is considering new versions of the 777 that would add both capacity and range.\nHeymann said Boeing also plans minor changes in the 747 including new digital cockpit electronics and computer software.

But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted.\nRubin outlined two possible approaches. Under one approach, some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded.\nUnder a second approach, no mixing would be allowed with banks but, as currently permitted, thrifts would be allowed to combine with  commercial firms.\nIf banks are allowed to mix with commercial firms, the reforms could take effect two years after enactment, Rubin said. If mixing is not allowed, the reforms could take effect in nine months.\nThe Federal Reserve should continue to oversee bank holding companies, while specific activities would be overseen by specific regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators.\nBanks would be allowed to underwrite municipal revenue bonds. An exemption for banks in the federal mutual fund law, the Investment Company Act, would be narrowed.\n", "The Colombian government said on Tuesday that 16 soldiers and as many as 15 leftist guerrillas were killed in a fierce four-day battle in a mountainous area near the capital city.\nThe fighting, in which the Defence Ministry said 13 to 15 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels were killed, began late on Friday when about 50 soldiers were airlifted into the area in pursuit of what was initially thought to be a small band of insurgents.\nThe battle was the worst and longest to erupt near Bogota in recent memory as what turned out to be hundreds of FARC rebels made their presence felt with a bang on the doorstep of the nation's capital.\nDefence Minister Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez, who announced the army casualty figure with \"deep regret\" in a national radio interview, denied reports that dozens of soldiers were missing or unaccounted for in the rugged combat area around this mountain town just 30 miles (50 km) east of the capital.\n\"There are no missing soldiers,\" Gonzalez said.\nHe said 21 soldiers were stranded in the early stages of the firefight. But he said all had been plucked to safety by their fellow troops and most were rescued unharmed.\nArmy chief Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett told foreign journalists last week that Bogota was among the strategic targets of the FARC and National Liberation Army, Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group.\nEarlier on Tuesday Colombia's army said it was pouring hundreds of reinforcements into the mountainous area.\nArmy sources in Villavicencio, capital of Meta province, told Reuters up to 1,000 troops were set to be ferried into the combat zone.\nMilitary sources also confirmed that intense aerial bombardments of the area had been under way since Sunday in a bid to crush the rebels.\nThe latest bombardments came just after dawn on Tuesday and lasted nearly 90 minutes. Later in the day helicopter gunships buzzed an outlying settlement and strafed hillsides.\nOne chopper later touched down in an area known as El Tablon and picked up at least three bodies of dead soldiers, witnesses said. No further gunfire was heard from mid-afternoon but an army officer said combat could restart at any moment.\n\"I'm sure the FARC hasn't got away. We have the exit routes out of the area blocked, they're just lying low,\" he said.\nAt least 400 people have fled to San Juanito from outlying villages since late on Friday, pouring into the streets of the normally quiet farming town of about 1,200 people.\n\"I was about half a mile from the fighting, at night I saw the bullets flying past my door and windows,\" said Jose Angel Munoz, who said he fled his village on Sunday with his wife and seven children.\n\"I've never known such fear, the fighting has never been this bad,\" he said.\n\"It made me so sad to see the bombings this morning,\" added Litia Gutierrez, another displaced villager. \"I just don't know when I can go home again or what I will find when I get there.\"\nThe combat zone was cordoned off by troops late on Tuesday. But there was no indication that FARC forces were fleeing in the face of the government's firepower.\nGonzalez said combat continued in the zone late on Tuesday and said \"it will continue as long as necessary.\"\n", "France's restructuring of its defence sector and the key role of state-owned Aerospatiale in that process are complicating the change in the European Airbus consortium into a limited liability company, analysts said.\nThe four national firms in Airbus Industrie are studying the best way to convert the partnership into a faster, more efficient company, better to compete with U.S. rival Boeing Co, which is merging with McDonnell Douglas.\nAerospatiale is not only the French partner in the Airbus passenger plane venture but is also involved in the two deals at the heart of France's defence industry consolidation -- the merger of Aerospatiale and combat plane maker Dassault Aviation and the privatisation of electronics firm Thomson-CSF .\n\"It is consistent with French strategic thinking that you must first get your house in order, then negotiate from a position of strength,\" said an industry executive.\n\"Aerospatiale cannot do this today in the Airbus system. It has to have weight behind it. It will have that weight when the Dassault merger is complete,\" he added. DASSAULT MERGER WILL BOOST AEROSPATIALE\nThe Dassault merger, due to be agreed this year, will add 13 billion francs of annual turnover to Aerospatiale, creating a group with combined sales of 64 billion and giving Aerospatiale greater clout at the Airbus negotiating table.\nA banker close to the Airbus talks said Aerospatiale is seen as the weakest among the senior Airbus partners -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa). Casa of Spain makes up the fourth Airbus partner.\nBut Aerospatiale will get an injection of aggressive, private-sector management with the Dassault merger.\nAerospatiale executives complain bitterly that the foreign media does not give them due credit for their industrial restructuring. Their efforts turned the company round to post a 1996 net attributable profit of 812 million francs, after years of losses, and racked up sales of 51 billion francs.\nTheir exasperation is palpable when they say their public sector tag is seen as a weakness when compared to the private sector BAe and Dasa.\nBut analysts point out that Aerospatiale was slower in attacking its cost structure and still needs to improve.\nBAe underwent drastic pruning in the early 1990s, going from an empire with property, cars and military interests to a group focused on defence and aerospace. It posted 1996 pretax profits of 425 million pounds, on sales of 7.44 billion pounds.\nDasa, although loss-making, has the industrial and financial strength of parent Daimler-Benz AG which has set a management target of a 12 percent return on capital. Dasa posted 1996 turnover of 13 billion marks, making it smaller than BAe and Aerospatiale, but it has huge ambitions for Airbus.\nA business consultant said Aerospatiale has excellent programmes, but, using benchmarking techniques, its military projects are 30 percent more costly than those of BAe and Dasa. THOMSON-CSF SALE ENHANCES PROSPECTS\nApart from the Dassault merger, Aerospatiale also holds a key hand in the Thomson-CSF sell-off.\nThe government has said bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere will have to take into account Aerospatiale's interests when putting together their offers for Thomson-CSF.\nEven though Aerospatiale, as a state-controlled company, cannot take part direcly in the privatisation, it will be affected by the outcome and chairman Yves Michot will give his views to the government on the rival bids.\nFrench newspapers have reported that Michot will have to observe strict neutrality in the contest. But it is clear Alcatel's plans would significantly strengthen Aerospatiale, giving it still greater weight against BAe and Dasa.\nIf Alcatel won Thomson-CSF, it would create a missiles joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, and a satellite venture between Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF.\nLagardere has said it wants a dialogue with Aerospatiale to prepare its bid. Relations between the two firms have been strained as they compete in missiles and satellites.\n\"The perimeter of Aerospatiale is not yet defined,\" said the industry executive.\nThe government plans to decide on the Thomson-CSF bids by June 30. AEROSPATIALE NEEDS AIRBUS, WILL MAKE IT WORK\nAerospatiale only stands to gain from the defence moves and is in no hurry to bow to pressures from BAe and Dasa to rush into an Airbus agreement which does not suit its own interests.\nAirbus is vitally important for Aerospatiale. Its 38 percent stake in Airbus contributed the biggest slice of 1996 operating profit, 1.175 billion francs, and around 70 percent of sales.\nAnalysts believe of the big Airbus three, Aerospatiale needs Airbus the most, and BAe and Dasa could, in extremis, walk away if relations broke down irreparably.\nBAe has a 20 percent Airbus stake and has bigger military interests, while Dasa's parent Daimler-Benz gets most of its money from the auto business, through Mercedes trucks and cars.\nAerospatiale has, paradoxically, maximalist and minimalist aims for the new Airbus company.\nFor the near term, Michot takes a cautious approach in the status change, arguing that the present system has proven its worth, winning Airbus a third of the world market, coming out of nowhere in 25 years. A much bigger manufacturing concern would overstretch the management.\nIn the long term however, Michot would like Airbus to have a military wing, to balance out economic cycles with government contracts. U.S. giant Lockheed Martin has both civil and defence sides, and Boeing will acquire McDonnell's significant military interests in the pending merger.\nThe Airbus partners said in January they agreed in principle on the change to a single integrated company, in which the new Airbus would own its factories and design offices. Work is going on this year on valuing the assets to be vested in the new firm.\nThat valuation is complicated as some of the factories mix civil and military programmes, and some plants are efficient while others are uncompetitive. In BAe's case this is made easy as it has a plant for making Airbus wings, and Dasa has a special production line near Hamburg for the Airbus 320 family.\nOne way of viewing the Airbus negotiations is through the prism of conflicting cultural visions.\n\"This country (France) has a vision of long-term industrial strategy. It wants to be a world power and be a dominant player in the aircraft industry,\" said the industry executive. Without that vision, Airbus arguably would never have got funds to launch its first plane in the early 1970s.\nSet against that long-term strategic view, is the British insistence on short-term returns for shareholders, summed up as \"Let the City decide\".\nBut Aerospatiale would not have signed the agreement on the Airbus change if it had not meant it, the executive said.\n", "Regulators want more time to overhaul the vast web of subsidies that keeps phone service affordable, creating a new obstacle in their efforts to spawn new competition and lower prices in the telephone business.\nFederal Communications Commission and industry officials said Tuesday the FCC is running into difficulties calculating the multi-billion dollar cost of paying for \"universal\" phone service to rural and other high-cost communities.\n\"We've been working hard for a year to try and reconcile this,\" said FCC Chief Economist Joseph Farrell. \"It would be a mistake to hurry it and do it wrong.\"\nLast year's communications law set a May 8 deadline for the FCC to tally the costs and to lay out a plan for a new fund to bankroll the subsidies. Phone carriers are supposed to pay for the fund.\nFCC Chairman Reed Hundt told the Wall Street Journal he wants to implement key provisions next year and use an interim plan in the meantime.\nThe FCC will work with state regulators to determine the costs of the subsidies.\nIndustry analysts and officials say the new uncertainty is likely to deter phone companies from rushing to compete in new areas of business or upgrade their existing lines of business.\n\"We need to know what the rules of the game are before we're willing to commit a lot of money to new projects,\" said Robert Blau, BellSouth Corp. vice president.\nSchwab Washington Research Group analyst Scott Cleland put it this way, \"When the playing field remains clouded, prudent competitors don't rush into the fog.\"\nThe phone business already has a huge cloud overhanging it after a U.S. appeals court last fall suspended a key FCC order designed to break open the $100 billion local phone market to long-distance carriers and other new competitors.\nThe FCC is trying to calculate the size of the universal service subsidies and make them explicit, as stipulated by the telecommunications law. Estimates range anywhere from $5 billion to $20 billion.\nThe existing subsidies are buried in the $23 billion in charges that long-distance companies such as AT&amp;T Corp. now pay to access the local phone network.\nThe FCC's desire to take more time on universal service has raised concern and questions among lawmakers anxious to ensure competition takes root after passage of the telecommunications law.\n\"If one of the implications (of the added time) is that it does delay competition, it's a problem for us,\" said Representative W.J. Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican.\n\"We're beginning to see some concerns about rising phone rates and cable rates. And we're beginning to be asked at town meetings when we're going to see the benefits of this highly touted deregulatory act.\"\nMeanwhile, the FCC's Hundt does want to proceed with one prized piece of universal service -- a $2.3 billion plan to link schools and libraries to the Internet at discounted rates.\nBut Tauzin worries that Hundt, in his desire to keep basic phone rates from rising, will expand obligations under universal service \"that somebody is going to have to pay for.\"\n", "China has scored new successes in its fight against inflation and economists said on Friday that price rises this year could be well below target.\nSome economists say inflation had been squeezed out of the economy with only a modest impact on growth as economic expansion continued at a fairly rapid pace.\n\"This is better than expected,\" said Chen Dezun, head of the price research institute of the State Planning Commission.\n\"We could see inflation of between three and four percent this year,\" he told Reuters.\nThe benchmark retail price index rose a meagre 1.7 percent in March and 2.6 percent for the first quarter of the year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.\nChina forecast a 6.0 percent rise in retail prices this year after a 6.1 percent increase last year. That was already well below the 14.8 percent recorded in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.\nChina's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent in 1996.\nThe inflation figure for the first quarter was also below an estimate by Premier Li Peng this week that retail price inflation would average 3.0 percent in the January-March period.\nChen said good weather had been a factor, ensuring steady supplies of agricultural goods and keeping prices down.\nWhat China officially refers to as \"appropriately tight\" monetary policies had also been a crucial factor, he said.\n\"The appropriately tight monetary policies are now showing results,\" he said.\nChina has kept controls on fixed asset investment, keeping government spending down, and that has kept a cap on the demand for goods such as construction materials.\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the real rise in fixed asset investment last year was a fairly modest 11.5 percent.\n\"The key has been control over fixed asset investment,\" said Zhong Jiyun, an economist at the state think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\nSome economists have argued that with the battle against inflation proceeding favourably, China can now afford to ease its monetary policies.\nMany inefficient state-run enterprises are swimming in red ink and saddled with debt they cannot repay.\nManagers of these companies and their local government officials have called for easier credit to help to reduce their heavy financial burden.\nBut Zhong is among the economists who believe that China is not yet able to declare the war on inflation over.\n\"I believe we still need to keep the controls on,\" he said.\n", "Boeing Co.'s engineers union said Wednesday it has filed a charge of unfair labour practices over the aerospace giant's decision to merge its training unit into a new venture with FlightSafety International.\nThe Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Assocation, which represents more than 23,000 mostly white-collar workers at Boeing, said it filed a complaint asking the National Labour Relations Board to prevent Boeing from completing its deal until the legal issues are resolved.\nCharles Bofferding, executive director of SPEEA, said the union had begun negotiations with Boeing after being surprised by the March 10 announcement of the deal with FlightSafety, which affects more than 600 Boeing employees, including about 240 union members.\nUnder the deal, Boeing and FlightSafety, a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., each would contribute $100 million in assets to create an international training company for commercial jet pilots and ground crews.\nBofferding said Boeing already has agreed to guarantee that employees will be offered other jobs at Boeing if they do not get similar positions in the new venture, known as FlightSafety Boeing Training International.\nBut he was not optimistic Boeing would agree to union demands that engineers who switch to the new venture will be allowed to keep their Boeing wages and benefits as well as union membership.\n\"Those two issues frankly we don't think we're going to clear up in negotiations,\" Bofferding said. \"It's very clear the company wants to give these people FlightSafety International benefits and strip away these people's union representation.\"\nA Boeing official said in a statement the company was \"disappointed\" the union felt a need to file the charge with the NLRB.\n\"We recognise our obligation to engage in these discussions with the union and welcome the opportunity to do so,\" said the official, Sants Contreras.  \"We have worked very hard over the last three years to build a strong, cooperative relationship with SPEEA, and we hoped to have more time to meet with the union on their concerns before they took this type of action.\"\nThe two sides will meet again Friday to continue their negotiations.\n", "Telecoms analysts in London were amused on Monday by Portugal Telecom SA's gaffe in stating that Telefonica de Espana SA had linked up with America's MCI Communications Corp.\nDespite Telefonica's denials that a deal had been signed with MCI, the partner of British Telecommunications Plc, most analysts expect a four-way alliance to be announced and said such a deal was already reflected in BT's share price.\nBT announced earlier that its Concert venture with MCI was forming a strategic partnership with Portugal Telecom but declined to comment on whether a similar deal had been struck with Telefonica's international arm Tisa.\n\"I'd say it's a bit of an 'oops' situation and someone has probably got egg on their face,\" laughed one analyst.\nAnother noted: \"It looks to me a bit like a cock-up for Portugal Telecom.\" But he added: \"It is becoming obvious that the four are going foward together. It should be good news.\"\nApart from winning exposure to Brazil through today's alliance with Portugal Telecom, Concert has little direct presence in other South American countries.\nBut a deal with Telefonica's international arm Tisa will add the rest -- the booming markets of Peru, Argentian, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and Puerto Rico -- to its growing geographic portfolio.\nJohn Tysoe, telecoms analyst at SocGen, said he would welcome a deal with both Iberian partners because it would \"close the door\" for Concert on the Americas. MCI is already the second largest carrier of international telephone traffic from the U.S. to Latin America.\nBecause few expect Telefonica to be able to remain in its current alliance in Europe, AT&amp;T -led Unisource, while joining arch-rival Concert in Latin America, analysts expect Telefonica to abandon Unisource.\nWithout Telefonica, analysts said Unisource would be severely weakened and this could force AT&amp;T to rethink its European strategy.\n\"The benefit for Concert of joining forces with Telefonica is that they weaken AT&amp;T while at the same time strengthening themselves,\" Tysoe said.\n\"The more people join in Concert, the less attractive AT&amp;T's option is,\" he added.\nAnother analyst noted that Telefonica had always been understood to want to be on the side of Portugal Telecom \"so that they don't need to fear that Portugal Telecom will invade Spain and vice versa\".\nThe analyst, who declined to be named, added that he had expected BT and MCI to take a five percent stake in Portugal Telecom, rather than the 1.5 percent holding they had agreed on.\n\"You could argue they are now spending their money more wisely and they are not going to invest that much in Portugal Telecom because they need money elsewhere,\" he noted.\nAlthough few believe that Telefonica will allow a partner to buy a stake in Tisa, BT is expected to try to break into the booming Asian markets. Analysts say BT is in talks with most strong players, including the likes of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.\nWhile global telecoms alliances such as Concert fall over themselves trying to plug holes in their geographic portfolios and make up for the growth lost in more mature markets, some analysts warn that not all strategic investments will be successful.\n\"Overall, it is more important to look at the core business which, for Concert, is the U.S. and UK -- and there, prices will only go one way -- down,\" said the analyst. \"Volumes will presumably also not continue to grow as healthily as they are growing at the moment.\n\"Perhaps not in the next week or two, but certainly within 1997, people will be much more sober,\" he warned.\nBT's transatlatic roadshows should pay off on Tuesday when shareholders are expected to approve the group's planned 12.3 billion pound ($20 billion) merger with MCI.\nAnalysts then expect the group to stop what one called \"its marketing machine\" and start concentrating again on its operations.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7987\n", "Deutsche Morgan Grenfell was unlikely to offer Nicola Horlick her job back, despite the former fund manager's continuing call for reinstatement, banking sources said.\n\"The ball's in her court,\" a banking source said late on Sunday, adding that Horlick's resignation last week meant that DMG's Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) was no longer obliged to discuss reinstatement with her.\nDeutsche Morgan Grenfell was preparing to launch an intensive campaign to shore up its pension fund business in the wake of Horlick's resignation at MGAM after she was suspended for allegedly trying to lure staff with her to another firm.\nThe investment banking arm of Germany's mighty Deutsche Bank was to meet key clients, but DMG spokesman James Murray denied pension firms were considering moving from its 18 billion pound ($30.11 billion) funds.\n\"We've had absolutely no indication that our institutional pension fund clients have plans at this stage to move their business,\" he said.\nMorgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), the fund management arm of DMG, has already written to all its pension fund clients to limit any fall-out from the suspension and later resignation last week of senior British fund manager Horlick.\nSome clients, including London's Westminster City Council, Scotland's Dumfries and Galloway County Council and the Merchant Navy Officers' Pension Fund, have expressed individual concern about recent events at MGAM.\nAnd the Railway Pension Trustee Company, which has 1.25 billion pounds with MGAM, said it had met MGAM officials and would be in close contact with its asset managers.\nMeanwhile, Horlick continued to deny the allegations that she had tried to lure staff away from MGAM.\n\"I think my colleagues know that's not the case,\" she told BBC television as reporters swarmed around her on Sunday.\nHorlick was suspended from the firm only days after she had been promoted to managing director at MGAM.\nHer subsequent resignation as head of MGAM's British pension fund business and dramatic dash to Frankfurt on Friday to plead with Deutsche Bank for her reinstatement received widespread coverage in British media.\n\"These people who I spoke to in Germany were very, very serious about all of this. And I want to give them a chance to sort this out,\" Horlick said on BBC television.\n\"What I really want is a proper resolution. And I still think that that means either reinstatement -- and I mean that, I like doing my job. Reinstatement or compensation,\" she added.\nMGAM is still trying to regain an even keel after last year's revelations of irregularities at three of its retail investment funds, the sacking of fund manager Peter Young, a 180 million pound cash injection to bolster the funds and the announcement of a 200 million pound compensation package.\nYoung, who denies any involvement in criminal activity, is now under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO).\nMuch of the media coverage of Horlick's case has focused on the \"human interest\" angle with pictures of the 35-year-old -- dubbed Superwoman by British newspapers -- with her children at their luxury home in Kensington, west London.\nFund management sources said Horlick, who stated she managed between three-and-a-half and four billion pounds worth of the firm's business, had talked about a management buy-out.\nBut they said that even if this had been discussed informally it would have had no hope of success as DMG, along with many other firms, was keen to build its strength in this lucrative area and would not dismantle its business.\nHorlick, who during a whirlwind campaign on Friday entered MGAM's London headquarters in an attempt to meet management and loudly proclaimed \"Justice will be done\", has said she wants to settle her differences as quickly as possible and is pinning her hopes on further talks with a Deutsche legal official.\nShe has said she plans legal action over what she claims was her \"constructive dismissal\" by the firm. But banking sources said it had not yet been served with any legal papers.\nHorlick's spokesman distanced her from reports a December lunch meeting had marked the start of talks with Dutch bank ABN AMRO on a move there. He said it had been a personal engagement and \"there was nothing culpable about meeting a friend...for lunch\".\nABN AMRO has denied it tried to poach any MGAM staff.

The economy performed pretty well,\" Eves said.\nHe declined to comment on economists' predictions that the 1996/97 deficit would drop below C$7 billion. Some analysts have speculated that the government could wipe out the deficit by fiscal 1999/2000, one year ahead of plan.\n\"It's not impossible, but it isn't a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination. There has to be some pretty significant growth,\" Eves said.  \nIn a pre-budget commentary on Wednesday, Toronto-Dominion Bank economists said Ontario could reach its deficit goal faster if the economy remained favorable.\nEves said it would be possible to balance the budget ahead of schedule if the economy grew around four percent annually for three straight years.\n\"If you had those types of growth numbers of around four (percent) or just under four (percent) for three consecutive years, I think it's possible that you could achieve that,\" he said.\nBut Eves said he would continue to use conservative economic forecasts in next week's budget.\n\"We would be more than happy to overachieve our targets and more than happy to get to our goal earlier than planned, but I'm not counting on it,\" he said.\nSome economists have speculated that Ontario's stronger economy and improving deficit outlook might allow Eves to speed up delivering the next stage of a promised 30 percent tax cut.\nAbout half the tax cut has been implemented, with the remaining 15 percent due by 1999.\n\"We said...we would provide half of the cut in our first budget and we did that. We (said) would provide for the next half over two years and I don't see any reason to change course,\" Eves said.\nSince taking power in 1995 promising a \"Common Sense Revolution\", the Conservatives have outlined deep spending cuts through the end of the decade.\nEves said most of the cost-cutting had been put in place and Tuesday's budget would include spending on infrastructure and restructuring of public services.\n\"We always said -- in the the health care field especially -- that as we found savings and efficiencies, we would reinvest,\" he said.\nDespite its deficit-cutting efforts, Ontario has not won a major rating upgrade from influential bond rating agencies.\n\"Sure you would like to see that recognition in the marketplace,\" Eves said, but he declined to comment when asked if Ontario deserved an upgrade.\n\"There have been a couple of upgrades in the Ontario's short-term ratings, but nothing substantial.

It also runs three plants in the Philippines and is developing a gas business there, Weaver said.\n\"We are looking at the commercial nuclear plants in the Philippines,\" he added.\nCMS is an integrated energy company that spreads its investment from gas exploration to electricity generation. NRG focuses mainly on electricity generation.  \nNRG is soon to close a deal on building and operating a joint venture coal-fired power station in West Java, Indonesia.\nThe deal, to be closed in four to six weeks, will be followed by \"our second deal in Asia in the next few months\", said NRG's Scaysbrook. He said the investment involved gas-fired power generation but declined to say more.\nNRG's parent, Northern States Power Co, is dependent on NRG for earnings growth and, in turn, NRG is looking to Asia to help deliver, said NRG chief executive David Paterson.\n\"We (NRG) have committed to them (NSP) that we will provide 20 percent of their earnings by the year 2000, and we are a little bit less than half of that at the moment,\" Paterson said.\n(A$1 = US$0.78)\n-- Melbourne bureau, 613-9286-1421,t\n", "After years of efforts to gain entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), China no longer cares whether it joins the global trade body, Tuesday's China Daily quoted a senior customs official as saying.\n\"Accession or not, China has become indifferent and doesn't care any more,\" the official newspaper quoted Wu Jiahuang, director-general of the customs administration's tariffs department, as saying.\nWestern diplomats in the capital said Wu's comments were more a reflection of differing internal views on the importance of the global economy rather than a signal of a shift away from Beijing's oft-stated desire to join the world's trade club.\nWu compared China's decade-long bid for entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the current attempts to join the WTO that succeeded it, to a \"sunken boat\" and an \"ailing tree\", the China Daily said in a front-page report.\nBeijing is seeking to join the WTO on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, but some members -- with the United States most vocal -- argue that China's economy is too large and powerful to be given such treatment.\nChina's leadership had concluded that negotiations with WTO members on its entry terms were politically tainted, Wu said.\nThe high-profile publication of Wu's views on WTO accession could be aimed at signalling that China was in no hurry to make concessions on terms, but was more likely an expression of internal differences, said one Western diplomat.\n\"They have their different interest groups in China, just as we have,\" he said. \"There are those who are charged with administering the tariffs and taking in the receipts and those who have a longer-term perspective on the whole thing.\n\"It doesn't change the basic fact that those who are charged with representing China in this matter do give us a different impression,\" he said.\nCustoms officials declined to comment on Wu's remarks, but officials of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said they represented a personal opinion and China's formal stance was unchanged.\nMOFTEC's more cheerful view of WTO accession was reflected in the inside pages of the China Daily, which quoted assistant minister An Min as saying early entry could boost investment.\n\"Optimistically speaking, the problem (concerning China's WTO membership) could be solved next year,\" An said.\nChina says it must be allowed a relatively long transition period to prepare key industries for the fierce foreign competition they would face under the WTO's freer trade rules.\nIt was unrealistic to demand that China open its markets too wide too soon, the official People's Daily newspaper on Tuesday quoted MOFTEC Minister Wu Yi as saying.\nMarket opening was a gradual process that required economic stability and prosperity, she said.\nTariffs chief Wu said Beijing was puzzled by the actions of developed countries such as the United States, European Union members and Canada that slapped quotas on Chinese textiles but refused to allow China time to protect its key industries.\n\"In their anxiety to carve out markets in China, chief WTO member countries have ignored China's rightful reasons to protect its national industries,\" he said.\nChina had been able to expand international trade to 44 percent of gross national product by 1995, despite a decade of fruitless efforts to join GATT and the WTO, he said.\n", "Regulators are considering extending consumer safeguards for 900-number phone calls to other pay-per-call services that have zapped unwitting consumers with sky-high phone bills for overseas calls.\nThe Federal Trade Commission Wednesday said it will seek public comment on whether to apply the rules to information and entertainment services that callers dial though a prefix other than \"900.\" The 900-number rules require clear cost disclosures and a means for settling billing disputes.\nThe newer services offer callers astrological and travel information, psychic advice and phone sex, among other things. Scams among \"audio information\" or \"audio entertainment\" services are a growing problem, according to one official.\nOfficials say providers of the services evade the 900 rules, adopted in 1992, by diverting calls to numbers in such countries as Guyana, the Dominican Republic, the tiny African country of Sao Tome, or the former Soviet Republic of Moldova.\nIn some cases the first three digits of the number -- such as 809, 758 or 664 -- resemble area codes in this country.\nThe difference: The overseas calls wind up in countries where the local phone company levies a charge of more than $2 a minute for completing the call. The rate far exceeds costs.\nGovernment officials said this allowed the overseas phone company to provide a \"kickback\" to the pay-per-call service for each call sent abroad, payments that can drum up business.\n\"It has probably helped them to establish a modern telephone system,\" one FTC official said of the foreign phone companies.\nLast year's overhaul of U.S. telecommunication law gave the FTC the authority to expand its 900-number rules to cover similar services not accessed by dialing 900.\nThose rules give consumers three seconds to hang up after listening to a message disclosing the cost of the service.\nA service also must spell out its costs. Calls that cost more than $2 must start with a message disclosing the price and identifying the name of the service.\nThe rules also ensure that consumers will not lose their phone service if they fail to pay for a 900 call. They also establish a mechanism for settling billing disputes.\nThe FTC recently brought a number of cases against alleged international pay-per-call schemes and has issued consumer alerts warning of the costs and risks of such services.\nLast month it closed three steamy sites on the Internet after consumers complained of huge phone bills to Moldova.\nThe agency alleged that Audiotex Connection of Long Island, N.Y., and others distributed a sophisticted computer programme that -- unbeknownst to consumers -- caused a computer user's modem to disconnect from their local Internet access company and dial an overseas pay-per-call number to the former Soviet Republic. A lawyer for those involved denied wrongdoing.\nTim Elliott, president of the TeleServices Industry Association, said new rules were not necessarily needed for his industry. \"We police ourselves. It's pretty effective.\"\nHe conceded, \"There are a lot of folks involved in the industry that are -- I don't want to say shady -- but who push the envelope.\"\n", "Deng Xiaoping's most daring attempt at reform of China was also among his most dismal failures -- politics.\nIt was an omission that will haunt his successors.\nHis anointed heir, Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin, will also almost certainly inherit a power struggle in a country where political structures have yet to fully enshrine the handover of power.\nDeng, who died late on Wednesday aged 92, had raised the prospect of democracy, ensuring tens of millions of peasants have the right to elect local representatives.\nBut he failed to build a structure that would solve the centuries-old problem of how an emperor could hand down power after he passed from the scene.\nDeng regarded political reform, complemented by economic invigoration, as crucial to the survival of Communist Party rule.\n\"In essence the purpose of political restructuring is to overcome bureaucratism, develop socialist democracy and stimulate the initiative of the people and of the grass-roots units,\" Deng told a Japanese visitor in September 1986.\nThe main aims he emphasised after he gained power in late 1978 were separation of party and government roles, rejuvenation of the leadership and re-establishment of party democracy.\n\"For Deng, democracy is a way of making the communist party state more efficient,\" wrote David Goodman in \"Deng Xiaoping.\"\nHe never envisaged a system of universal suffrage and was therefore forced to crush those who went too far by demanding Western-style democracy and finally to settle for superficial reform that would not allow any threat to party supremacy.\nHis combination of rapid economic reform alongside gradual political change saved China's Communist Party from the fate of its Soviet cousin -- where rapid political reform toppled a regime that did not press ahead on the economic front.\nHe ended up creating a system in which the party held sway as a virtual parasite to a parallel government, economic and social structure and where corruption and abuse of power flourished in the loopholes.\nDeng separated functions of party and government to stop the party interfering to replace government, to prevent over-concentration of authority in party and in individual hands and to end absence of responsibility in the bureaucracy.\nThe party should guide, not govern, in Deng's view.\nBy the time of his death, the government was responsible for administration, it was the executor of decisions on policy that were the prerogative of the party.\nDeng pulled no punches in injecting new blood into a party leadership riddled with ageing veterans after the upheaval of the 1966-76 radical Cultural Revolution.\nHe battled stiff opposition to shunt elders into a temporary holding pen -- the Central Advisory Commission, which he was finally able to retire in 1993.\nTo try to ensure an orderly succession, he set an example by stepping down from a string of public offices, abandoning all his positions by the end of 1989.\nBut he was forced to appoint and then sack two heirs apparent.\nHis third choice, Jiang Zemin -- also chosen by Deng personally to head the party -- survived until Deng's death, but with no orderly succession pattern yet in place to prevent the usually brutal and often bloody succession struggles that have followed the deaths of Chinese emperors for centuries.\nEncouragement of party-led democracy -- emphasis on the need to stimulate individual and group initiative -- was the third plank in his political reform programme.\n\"In the final analysis, all our other reforms depend on the success of political reforms, because it is human beings who will -- or will not -- carry them out,\" Deng said in 1986.\n\"Without political reform, economic reform cannot succeed because the first obstacle to overcome is people's resistance.\"\nDeng drew the line when the enthusiasm of the people for political reform became too extreme with open calls for democracy, and he sent the army to kill unarmed students who urged greater openness in the spring of 1989.\nHe did allow limited democracy, with villages all over China empowered to elect district leaders from a pool of more than one candidate but free speech and publication of ideas and assembly were going too far.\nThose limits may influence a final judgment on his standing in Chinese history.\n\"In the annals of history there is only a small chapter devoted to those who advanced economic progress,\" wrote Lucian W. Pye in \"Deng Xiaoping: Portrait of a Chinese Statesman\".\n\"The big chapters are reserved for those leaders who brought political freedom and security to their people.\"\n", "Tens of thousands of government workers took to the streets in Colombia's capital on Thursday on the third day of a nationwide strike to press demands for a sharp public sector wage hike.\nAt least 50,000 workers took part in the peaceful demonstration in Bogota, which involved a march down 7th Avenue, the city's main thoroughfare, to historic Plaza Bolivar in the city's colonial centre.\nSimilar demonstrations -- and the resulting traffic jams -- were planned in four other leading cities, as union leaders stepped up demands for the government to lift a ceiling on public sector pay rises that would hold most workers to a 13.5 percent increase -- despite inflation of more than 21.6 percent last year.\nA demonstration in Bogota on Tuesday, on the first day of the strike, ended in running battles between riot police and a 200-strong group of protesters hurling bricks and bottles. But there was no immediate report of any strike-related violence on Thursday.\nMauricio Guzman, mayor of the southwest city of Cali, said several \"agitators\" planning to join in street protests there had been arrested for possession of explosives. A small bomb blast rocked the city, Colombia's second biggest, early on Thursday but there were no reports of injuries or serious damage.\nGovernment officials restarted talks with union leaders on Thursday morning in a bid to end the strike by an estimated 800,000 workers nationwide.\nBut no progress was reported when the talks adjourned for two hours shortly before noon.\nBefore heading into the talks, Interior Minister Horacio Serpa said he hoped for \"serene and sincere\" negotiations. But he stressed that the government, which is battling to rein in a burgeoning fiscal deficit, did not have much room for manoeuvre.\nUnion representatives expressed mild optimism but insisted the strike would not be lifted until there was firm agreement on demands, including a 21.5 percent pay hike and an end to the planned privatisation of regional and national industries.\nAn earlier round of negotiations ended in deadlock on Sunday when the government stuck to its original weighted 13.5 percent pay offer and refused to budge on privatisation plans.\nUnitary Workers' Confederation leader Luis Eduardo Garzon said state workers may bend on some of their demands if the government was prepared to compromise.\n\"I think there's a positive atmosphere. We're ready to look for alternatives if the government is prepared to do the same,\" he said.\nThere have been conflicting reports on the impact of the industrial action. President Ernesto Samper said just 10 percent of state workers had heeded the strike call while unions said they had severely disrupted key economic and social sectors, including oil, telecommunications, education and all but emergency health care and long-distance road freight.\nDespite threats from National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels and government warnings that leftist guerrillas were trying to infiltrate the strike movement, no serious violence has been reported since the start of the work stoppage at midnight Monday.\n", "African coffee producers will meet March 6-7 for talks on implementing a robusta export limit set in Brazil in January to boost world prices, the Interafrican Coffee Oraganisation (IACO) told Reuters on Monday.\n\"Ministers will discuss exports and the implementation of the decisions for the rest of the coffee year,\" said IACO Seceretary General Arega Worku.\nThe Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) held an emergency meeeting in Rio de Janeiro last month after African producers' calls for action to boost flagging late-1996 prices.\nMembers agreed to cut robusta exports by one million bags (60 kg) and arabica exports by 300,000 bags between January and June 1997.\nThe IACO Special Ministers Conference, to be held on March 6-7 in Ivory Coast's commercial capital, Abidjan, will include ministers from IACO's 25 member states under IACO Chairman and Ivorian Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze, Worku said.\n\"The initiative of the Africans boosted coffee prices,\" said Worku. \"Now we think we should reinforce this performance and think of other measures for which we would like to have the recommendations of the member countries.\"\nIACO last met in Abidjan for its 36th General Assembly in November when it decided to consider \"prompt response\" measures depending on market price direction.\n\"We must now reinforce the current limitation programme coupled with a prompt response strategy,\" IACO Chief Economist Donald Kaberuka told Reuters on Monday.\nIvory Coast had originally pencilled in a late February date for the latest IACO talks.\nWorld robusta prices soared after January's ACPC meeting.\n\"Market perceptions are as important as fundamentals and fund activities,\" Kaberuka said, referring to some market analysts' belief that ACPC cuts had not caused the rises.\nIndonesia said after the ACPC talks it would cut its robusta exports by 150,000 bags, leaving Arican producers to decide on how to share the rest of the one million bag quota.\nIvory Coast, Africa's main robusta exporter, has forecast a 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) crop of 230,000 tonnes but has had qualtiy problems in some areas.\nIndustry sources told Reuters the Ivorian crop could exceed 250,000 tonnes. One quality inspector said he doubted more than 150,000 tonnes would be marketable.\nKaberuka said high robusta prices would mean a market would be found for even poorer grades.\n\"Low quality coffee can be sold.

On the same basis profits and new business sales in the group's life business rose 25 percent.\nGeneral insurance profits increased to 67 million pounds, up three million pounds over 1996 despite a reduction in profits in Britain due to increased competition.\nThe company is set to unveil details of its strategy for the UK general insurance business next month.\nA fall in weather losses helped U.S. results while France and Australia also saw profit increases.\nWeather claims in the U.S. fell 23 million pounds over the period to six million pounds after the milder winter.\nIn Britain, weather costs were broadly flat.\nBut a dry start to the year and increased turnover in the housing market combined to push up subsidence costs.\nClaims notifications were up 11 percent while costs increased to 11 million pounds from seven million pounds.\nEchoing comments made by General Accident which reported on Tuesday, Commercial Union said British general insurance rates remained competitive though there was evidence of firming in certain classes of business, particularly motor.\nU.S. general insurance was also competitive and average rate increases there had broadly matched inflation.\nFrance was seeing rises in certain classes but areas such as motor cover were becoming more difficult, the company said.\nLife profits over the quarter increased to 62 million pounds from 58 million pounds last year, with strong performances from the UK, the Netherlands and France.\nExcluding the impact of exchange rates, new life, pensions and investment sales rose by 25 percent.\nWith the acquisition of 73 percent of French life assurer Societe d'Epargne Viagere (SEV) in April, life operations now account for around 50 percent of total group premium income.\nThe growth of the life business, part of a long-standing strategy, is set to continue for the foreseeable future.\nThe company hopes to take advantage of future changes in welfare provision in Britain and continental Europe.\nDemographic changes putting pressure on spending on state pensions, sickness and accident benefits is expected to provide a growing number of opportunities for private providers in years to come.\nGrowth is likely to be organic but the company remains open-minded about acquisitions.\n\"If a suitable opportunity arose we would certainly consider it... but we're not actively seeking acquisitions,\" said finance director Peter Foster.\nSales at the company's French life operations were expected to remain dull for the rest of this year and possibly early into 1998 as the reorganisation of the sales force continued.\nFirst quarter new sales figure in France, where new single premium business fell 16 percent, disappointed many.\nThe reorganisation, a rise in interest rates and strong 1996 first quarter comparisons were among the factors blamed for the shortfall.\nCommercial union continues to eye further opportunities in eastern Europe after the success of its Polish operations and will start writing business in the Czech Republic later this year.

It looks like a defensive move,\" a share analyst said.\nLyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod told Europe 1 radio on Friday that the new group would have four core businesses -- energy, water distribution, waste management and communications.\n\"What do shareholders stand to gain?\" a second analyst asked. \"There is still uncertainty,\" he added.\nIn the short term, Suez shareholders can look forward to  a big cash payout as part of the merger terms, with a dividend estimated at around 24 francs per share, or a total of some 3.8 billion francs.\nThey are also getting a chance to cut the discount on Suez shares compared with underlying assets -- if the new group buries Suez's holding company image by selling financial assets to concentrate on utilities, as promised.\nSuez investors will also gain by getting shares in Lyonnaise, which for all its past weakness, is one of France's biggest companies and harbours big expansion ambitions.\nBut Suez holders still need to be convinced on big issues related to the merger.\nThe merger is being structured as a Lyonnaise takeover of Suez, apparently to take advantage of Suez's tax loss carry-forward, which would shelter future profits of the new group. \"This needs to be clarified,\" said an analyst.\nFor Lyonnaise shareholders, the deal looks more risky.\nThey do not know if Suez chairman Gerard Mestrallet has made guarantees of management freedom to the Belgian government for the Societe Generale de Belgique holding company, which groups choice industrial and financial assets.\nAny commitments may inhibit SGB's disposal of Belgian financial assets, which include stakes in banking giant Generale de Banque and insurer Fortis.\nFrench investment in Belgium has become a sensitive issue since Renault SA's decision to close its Vilvoorde plant near Brussels at heavy cost to jobs.\nThe Belgian authorities insist on keeping the Tractebel utilities company, 50.3 percent owned by SGB, independent and headquartered in Belgium. This may limit the scope for integrating Tractebel into Lyonnaise's global ambitions.\nHowver, Tractebel could benefit from asset transfers from Lyonnaise, such as the Elyo energy subsidiary.\nThe disposal of Suez's French financial units such as consumer credit house Sofinco, property broker Banque Monod and insurer Henin Vie, pose less of a problem.\nCredit Agricole, which last year bought Banque Indosuez, has an option to buy 20 percent of Sofinco next year.\nLyonnaise shareholders stand to gain an injection of fresh capital which the company needs to finance its global aspirations.

We will tell them what we think they can achieve in the debt markets and we'll put our corporate reputation behind what we say,\" he added.\nCIB's major business groupings are Treasury and Capital Markets including foreign exchange; bond sales; securitisation, Structured Finance, which includes syndicated loans; project finance; and credit trading and Risk Finance which includes acquisition finance and development capital and Trust Bank which is substantial investor services business.\nThe group has main offices in Edinburgh and Manchester as well as London.\nRobertson said the bank wanted to develop its niche products outside the UK possibly with joint ventures such as that in project finance with Banco Santander in South America.\nRoyal Bank has a high quality book of around $1.0 billion in the US but sees little opportunity for indigenous major growth.\nIn the core business, he also sees the opportunity to grab market share from competitors by adopting the same strategy seen in its large corporate business of cross-selling products.\n", "France's Lyonnaise des Eaux and holding company Cie de Suez agreed on Friday to merge, creating a new global utilities heavyweight, and announced a series of financial goals.\nAs part of the deal creating a group with annual sales of more than 200 billion francs ($34.5 billion) and market capitalisation of 75 billion francs, Suez said it would pay its shareholders a dividend sweetener worth three times last year's payout.\nThe companies said in a joint statement they expected 1997 net profits of at least 3.50 billion francs and aimed to double earnings per share in five years after 1997.\n\"Beyond this year, the goal is to double net earnings per share in five years,\" they said. Shareholders of the new group will benefit from an immediate positive effect on net earnings of eight percent on the 1997 results.\nThe statement came after the Suez and Lyonnaise supervisory boards met to approve merger terms for the group that will be known as Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux.\nSuez said shareholders would be asked to approve the merger terms at a meeting on June 11 and authorise a dividend of 24.60 francs a share -- representing a total payout of 3.8 billion francs. It paid a dividend of 8.20 francs for 1995.\nUnder the agreement, Suez shareholders will get 20 Lyonnaise shares for 41 Suez shares. Trading in the two companies' shares was suspended on the Paris bourse on Friday.\nThe merger agreement ends the independence of Suez, set up in the 19th century to build the Suez Canal, a glory of French engineering.\nLyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod told Europe 1 radio earlier on Friday that the larger group would absorb Suez, whose activities involve financial services and utilities, through a friendly \"merger-takeover.\"\nLyonnaise's \"mission is to conquer the world,\" said Monod.\nThe group will focus on four core businesses -- energy, water distribution, waste management and communications -- and would give shareholders \"a very big world actor that will be a leader in its activities and enjoy high visibility,\" Monod said.\nIt would have the resources to invest around 17 billion francs from its first year of operation, he said. He has promised that the merged group will boost profits and cashflow.\nLyonnaise, whose activities span water distribution, construction and communications, has been pushing the deal as an operation that will give it extra muscle to expand abroad.\nLyonnaise is twice the size of Suez in terms of shareholder funds and one third bigger in share capitalisation.\nSuez, once one of France's grandest corporate institutions that grew through acquisitions, fell victim in the early 1990s to a property slump.\nDisgruntled Suez shareholders forced out the previous chairman Gerard Worms after the group made a four billion franc loss in 1995 and installed Gerard Mestrallet to turn round the overly diversified colossus.\nMestrallet swiftly sold crown jewels such as investment bank Banque Indosuez and fund manager Gartmore. He also disposed of the ailing real estate portfolio, leaving Suez with more than five billion francs in cash.\nBut he held on to a 63-percent stake in Belgian holding company, Societe Generale de Belgique, which groups some choice industrial and financial assets.

Hanson shareholders will be asked to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on February 21.\nOnce Energy is split off as a separate company, to be listed in London and New York, the rump Hanson group will consist of a clutch of building firms.\n\"We are all very enthusiastic about the future of Energy and new Hanson and are convinced that both will benefit from enhanced focus on operations, profitability and future growth prospects,\" chairman Lord Hanson said.\nThe first two demergers of Britain's Imperial Tobacco and U.S.-quoted Millennium Chemicals took place last October.\nEnergy, which will be large enough to rank inside Britain's top 100 blue chips and the Fortune 500 in the U.S., is the last to be split off.\nIts new management team is led by Derek Bonham, executive chairman, with two joint chief executives to run operations at the main businesses -- Peabody mining and Eastern, the British electricity division.\nBonham told a press briefing the group planned to target a number of acquisitions, particularly in the U.S., and admitted entering into \"exclusive and confidential\" talks with a U.S. power marketing company, subject to due diligence.\nIt is also examining generating deals in the U.S. and Britian, it said.\nPeabody chief executive Irl Engelhardt told a press briefing that the coal group could use its knowledge of the U.S. market to help Energy exploit opportunities there.\nGroup finance director Eric Anstee said the group would \"take the cash generation of the coal and network businesses and use it where we see future growth in earnings -- the growing power sector\".\nEastern generated a total of 354 million pounds ($571 million) in cash flow in the year ended September 30, he said.\nEnergy, which owns Eastern, Britain's fourth largest electricity generator, said that worldwide demand for energy is expected to rise 34 to 46 percent between 1993 and 2010.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, world electricity output is expected to grow 63 percent to 2010. Coal and gas will account for 41 percent and 17 percent of that generation level by 2010.\nEnergy, which is being sold with 1.4 billion pounds of debt, sees this, deregulation in world markets and privatisation as the key opportunities for the group.\nInvestor roadshows are being planned on both sides of the Atlantic, with 35 percent of Hanson's shares held in the U.S.\nThe group's annual turnover in the year to September 30, 1996 was 3.6 billion pounds, with pre-exceptional profits of 446 million pounds. Total assets are 5.7 billion pounds.

We think the boom will continue through (1997),\" said Philip Keevil, managing director at Salomon Brothers.\nA record $658.8 billion worth of transactions was announced in 1996, far surpassing initial expectations for the year, according to figures compiled by Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J.-based firm that tracks deals.\nThe key driver in the current merger trend has been the high-flying stock market, coupled with corporate trends that stress consolidation and cost-cutting.\n\"At the beginning of 1996, it looked like it would be another good year for mergers. That got blown to pieces. It's hard to know if (1997) will be better, but it feels real good,\" said Steven Wolitzer, managing partner and co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Lehman Brothers.\nIndustry experts said the pipeline for potential deals appears full for at least the first six months of 1997.\n\"We're at a really high level of activity. There is good corporate profitability and people are using their money for share buybacks and acquisitions,\" said Robert Lovejoy, managing director at Lazard Freres.\nAnd investors like to see acquisitions.\n\"Shareholders expect managements to be taking pro-active steps to generate value-enhancing transactions. And the management of these corporations realise they can't count on the stock market\" to boost profitability, said Bruce Nolop, managing director at Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co.\nFederal deregulation is expected to drive more consolidation in telecommunications and utilities, two of the most active sectors in 1996. The telecommunications sector rang up the biggest deals of 1996, and the utilities industry also played a large role in the year's transactions.\nMerger experts predict energy companies, which spent much of 1996 forming alliances and divesting properties, will become more aggressive buyers and sellers in 1997. The nation's refiners, plagued with poor profit margins, especially are expected to participate in the merger trend.\nMeanwhile, the prospect of mergers are hovering over the nation's airlines. Industry experts believe a consolidation of the airline industry is inevitable, especially as American Airlines and British Airways Plc pursue a wide-reaching partnership.\nSimilarly, a resolution of the takeover battle for Conrail Inc. will likely trigger other railroad mergers, experts said. CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. are locked in a bidding war for Conrail and the losing railroad is likely to seek another partner, they said.\n", "Following years of delay, regulators are set to announce approval of plans to create a new type of radio service that offers CD-quality sound and can be heard coast-to-coast, government officials said Friday.\nThe four members of the Federal Communications Commission have resolved long-standing differences over allocating the two available radio licenses to the four companies seeking to offer so-called Digital Audio Radio Service, or DARS.\nThe four are: CD Radio Inc.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp.; Digital Broadcast Satellite Corp.; and Primosphere.\nUnlike conventional radio, the new digitally based service will offer listeners extra-clear sound and will be broadcast nationwide via satellite.\nListeners will have to buy a special radio and antenna. It is likely the service will be subscription-based.\nThe officials, who requested anonymity, said the FCC's approval is expected to be announced soon, possibly as early as Monday.\nDespite reservations from two commissioners, the agency has in effect agreed to limit an auction of the two licenses to the four companies -- which had filed applications with the FCC in the early 1990s. The sale is expected by mid-April.\nOn Monday, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt raised the specter of a potential snag. He insisted an auction should be open to any company that wants to bid, instead of the existing four.\nBut two other commissioners -- James Quello and Rachelle Chong -- had opposed opening the auction.\nThe fourth commissioner, Susan Ness, favoured opening the bidding, but was willing to back a limited auction to allow the FCC to move forward promptly.\nAn open auction could have raised a sizeable sum for the government by attracting more bidders.\nHundt had noted pointedly that MCI Communications Corp. last year paid $683 million to win the last remaining satellite slot to beam television programmes nationwide.\nIn the end, the government officials said, Hundt and his colleagues allowed the limited auction to proceed, given that the applicants have been waiting years.\n\"These people applied many years ago,\" said one official.\n\"At the end of the day, you can't hold this thing up forever,\" said another.\nAn auction date must still be set. But the bidding is expected to be held before April 15.\nThe commissioners, in resolving another dispute, agreed to require the eventual license winners to provide discounted advertising rates and equal time to political candidates running for federal office.\nThe commission also put the applicants on notice that the winners could be subject to other public-interest obligations in the future.\n", "Regional Baby Bell phone companies appear to have triumphed over their long-distance rivals in a crucial regulatory battle that would leave some customers paying less and others more for their monthly bill.\nThe Federal Communications Commission has decided against ordering a precipitous cut in the $23 billion long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp. pay the Bells each year for access to the local phone network, said FCC and industry officials.\nBell executives at one point feared such cuts could cost their companies as much as $10 billion in revenues. Consumer groups and long-distance companies advocate immediate cuts in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, saying that would mean a similar cut in long-distance rates.\n\"The Bells have dodged a bullet,\" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group. \"They may get grazed. But they dodged a bullet that was aimed at them during the last six months.\"\nInstead of a big FCC-imposed cut, the agency plans to rely on competition to lower access charges over time, said FCC and industry officials. That could mean an FCC-imposed loss of Bell revenues of no more than $1 billion the first year.\nLess clear was the impact on phone customers.\nThose who make lots of long-distance calls would see a sizeable drop in their bills, said FCC officials.\nBut wireless phone subscribers could pay anywhere from 1 percent to 2 percent more a month through new fees. Customers with more than one phone line for a computer or the kids and who make few long-distance calls would see a monthly rate rise of around $1 or more.\n\"We're cutting away the frills,\" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview.\n\"We're talking about a $1 subsidy per month that we're eliminating for somebody who's connecting a $2,500 computer to that line and purchasing $20 a month of unlimited access,\" said Hunt, a big advocate of the rules under consideration.\nThey are set to be voted on next week. Details may change.\nFCC officials, meanwhile, say the plan would yield a cut in long-distance charges of more than $1 billion in the first year.\nFCC officials oppose a steep cut for several reasons.\nCiting rate hikes by AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp. late last year, they fear long-distance carriers may not fully pass on a major reduction to consumers and pocket some of the money. Long-distance executives vow to pass on the reductions.\nFCC officials also fear a sharp cut would unleash a rise in local phone rates by carriers trying to recoup lost money.\n\"We're keeping basic residential dial tone at today's price,\" said Hundt.\nCritics charge the plan would mean higher rates. AT&amp;T says long-distance customers will see a $1.5 billion jump at the outset in July. \"Regulators appear unlikely to squeeze the fat out of the Bells' prices, leaving consumers paying for inflated rates,\" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union.\nBut Hundt says that over the next five years at least $10 billion \"will be transferred to consumers\" via access cuts.\nThe plan also would pay for $3 billion to connect schools, libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet and provide cheap phone service for the poor.\nAccess charges were created after the 1984 breakup of Ma Bell. Experts agree the $23 billion is more than the cost of providing local access. But they cannot agree on the amount.\nFCC officials said 85 percent of the nation's 80 million residential phone customers would see a lower monthly bill.\nThose who make lots of long-distance calls would benefit the most, because the agency plans to replace some of the existing per-minute access charges with a monthly flat rate.\nThe 15 percent of residents who do not make long-distance calls would see their bills stay the same.\nBut customers with more than one line and who make few long-distance calls are likely to see a rate rise.\nThat's because the ceiling, or cap, on the existing \"subscriber line charge\" is expected to rise to $5 a month from $3.50 for each additional residential line, and to roughly $7 a line for multi-line business customers from $6.\nOne possible way around the charge may be for customers to list their additional lines in a different name or use another local carrier, said industry officials.\n", "A wave of high-yielding Czech crown Eurobonds that has flooded the debt market since the beginning of the year has begun to ebb, as interest rates ease and arbitrage opportunities decline, analysts said on Tuesday.\n\"The Euro-madness is definitely over. We may see a couple more issues but those will be mainly by issuers who are active in the Czech Republic,\" Ota Otepka, chief bond trader at ING Barings, told Reuters.\nSince the start of the year, issuers have rushed to take advantage of a stable, strong currency and interest rates above 11 percent, flooding the market with nearly 30 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) worth of Eurobonds in just over four weeks.\nDealers said that with interest rates so high, and a crown that is 65 percent linked to the mark but yielding seven to eight percentage points above it, the appetite for crown Eurobonds had appeared insatiable.\nBut interest rates have eased some 60-70 basis points since the start of the year and yields have dropped, spoiling the appetite for many investors.\n\"Maybe lead managers were overly optimistic about the potential placing capabilities and appetite of foreign investors,\" said Jan Pudil of WoodCommerz.\n\"Of course this hunger has been filled quite substantially. At this stage we are at the level where these investors are now satisfied,\" he added.\nMore than 20 bond issues were launched in crowns by a host of top-rated, retail-friendly names, lured by its reputation as one of Europe's most stable currencies.\nGerman media group Bertelsmann AG launched on Tuesday a one billion crown one-year bond with a 10.5 percent coupon, but the rate of issuance has slowed.\nAnalysts estimate about 90 percent of the crown bonds were bought by retail investors from Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland.\nInvestors saw a great chance of picking up high-yield, low-risk paper but issuers and managers were presented with an easy arbitrage opportunity since rates were so high.\nBut Pudil said that issuers, once awash in opportunities for currency swaps, were now hard pressed to find advantageous rates allowing many to place bonds with coupons above 10 percent, a psychological minimum level.\n\"You have a three-year swap now at 10.25 percent and if you were to bring a cross-currency swapped three-year Eurobond, you get a coupon below 10 percent and you can't sell something to west European retail investors at below 10 percent,\" he said.\nAnother trader added: \"A lot of the issues were swap driven, but swap prices have fallen below the Eurobond yields and this has stopped the arbitrage possibility.\"\n\"We also may see declining interest in buying Czech Eurobonds because the crown is so strong that its security is declining,\" he added.\nThe crown was fixed at a record high against its dollar/mark basket on Tuesday at 5.51 percent above the parity midpoint, some three percentage points higher than at the beginning of the year.\nTraders added that two and three-year bonds are almost impossible to launch now, given the lack of arbitrage options. Most issuers had preferred short-dated bonds anyway due to an inverted yield curve which meant higher coupons are available at shorter maturities.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($ = 27.92 Czech Crowns)\n", "Czech President Vaclav Havel on Wednesday told the nation that he had a near-death experience after radical surgery which removed a cancerous tumour in his lungs over four weeks ago.\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since the December 2 operation, Havel, looking thinner and grasping for breath but speaking clearly, reflected on his illness and the loss of his wife Olga to cancer last January.\n\"In the year we have just dismissed, I have faced death twice. First, when it came for my closest being, and second when it swirled around my hospital bed,\" he said in the videotaped nationally televised New Year's greeting.\nHavel, in a reflective mood even more profound than usual for the former playwright, said both events caused great suffering and made him feel that the world was unjust.\n\"But on the other hand, both of these experiences, to my own surprise, I have perceived as great challenges for a new and far deeper consideration of the world in which we live.\"\nHavel said that he pondered \"about myself, about the mysterious order of human existence, and about the volume of signs or hidden messages which are speaking to us from within this order, which we are mostly ignoring.\"\nHavel, the chain-smoking leader of Prague's bloodless 1989 revolution over communism, entered a clinic on November 25 with what his office called a case of pneumonia.\nA week later Doctors performed exploratory surgery and found a small malignant tumour in the right lobe of his lungs.\nSurgeons decided immediately to remove half of the lobe, and said later that it appeared that the cancer was caught in an early stage and had not spread to other tissue.\nBut Havel, aged 60, developed pneumonia in the left lobe soon after the surgery and fought off a high fever, the seriousness of which is only now coming to light.\nFor weeks he was on a respirator connected through his throat but was released from hospital on the day after Christmas after the pneumonia and fever subsided.\nDoctors have said that Havel's condition has been steadily improving and his prospects for a full recovery are good.\nThe less than eight-minute address, which he taped in a business suit sitting at a desk in his private west Prague villa, replaced his traditional New Year's speech which is normally much longer.\nHavel concentrated his prepared remarks on creating a deeper understanding of common goals in Czech society.\nHe recalled that 1996 brough many \"important, beautiful, and painful\" things to the Czech public.\nHe said the year was tainted by the failure of several banks, political spats, and various corruption which had emerged from the country's massive post-Communist privatisation programme and economic reforms.\n\"I implore you... to try to understand all of these ugly things as warning signs calling us all to a newer and deeper consideration of the sense of our common affairs,\" he said.\nThe greatly popular Havel also thanked all who have supported him through his illness, and said he hoped that Czechs still could rely on him.\nThe Czech agency CTK reported on Wednesday that Havel's staff at Prague Castle had agreed to stop smoking in the office in a show of solidarity with the president who was advised by doctors to give up his several-packs-a-day habit.\nHe made no mention however of his smoking in the speech.\nHavel is expected in February to finalise a long-awaited declaration of reconciliation with Germany, which has been a focus of his presidency, aiming to put an end to anxiety of the neighbouring countries over World War Two and its aftermath.\n", "Apple Computer Inc. reported a $708 million second-quarter loss Wednesday, reflecting a charge for the layoff of a third of its employees and weaker sales of its personal computers,\nApple said, however, that strong sales of new, speedy PCs and laptops and lower expenses would help the company meet its goal of reporting a profit by its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in September.\nThe Cupertino, Calif.-based computer company's net loss, equivalent to $5.64 a share, for the fiscal quarter ended March 28 compared with a net loss of $740 million, or $5.99 a share, in the year-ago quarter.\nApple's loss from operations of $186 million, or $1.48 a share, was worse than the consensus industry analyst forecast of $1.22 a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst forecasts.\nThe $708 million net loss included a $155 million charge to cover the cost of layoffs and a $375 million charge for the acquisition of software developer Next Software Inc.\nApple said, however, that it expects to see higher revenue and a reduced operating loss in the third quarter as its restructuring programme takes hold. In March, the company said it would lay off 4,100 employees and reorganize operations to cut costs.\n\"Don't open champagne bottles yet, but the process seems to be working,\" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.\nDuring the quarter, Apple introduced a jazzy laptop and a speedy desktop machine for small businesses, schools and homes. Sales of the new machines have been strong, the company said.\n\"We feel the worst is behind us and our strategy is on track,\" Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio said in a telephone conference call with analysts. He said sales will probably increase in the third quarter over the second and that the company probably will meet its goal of being profitable again by the fourth quarter.\nStill, even with better financial health, Apple faces serious problems, analysts said.\nThe number of Apple computers shipped worldwide in the second quarter plunged 33 percent to 602,000 units, compared with 892,000 units in the same quarter a year ago. The drop was bigger than most analysts expected.\nSales in Japan and Europe also were weak, Apple executives said in the conference call.\n\"I want to see a couple of positive quarters before I say they're beginning to turn the corner,\" said Michael Kwatinetz, analyst at the DMG Technology Group investment bank in New York.\nTo keep costs in line with declining sales, Apple in the past year has laid off more than 5,000 employees. The company also has seen its entire management suite change in 15 months.\nThe uncertainty about the company's future still is keeping customers away from the Mac aisle at stores, analysts said.\nDataquest, which tracks PC sales worldwide, says Apple's share of the worldwide market fell to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent. The slide left Apple's market share at the lowest point in three years.\n", "Heavily indebted Nippon Credit Bank Ltd said on Thursday it will tie up with New York blue chip Bankers Trust to help turn some of its loans into cash.\nNCB, with a heavy load of real estate loans left over from the asset bubble of the 1980s, has been considered the most endangered large bank in Japan's faltering banking sector.\nOn April 1 it announced that it was retreating from the international arena. It also said that it was selling prime real estate and floating new shares to try to rebuild its capital base.\nUnder the alliance, Bankers Trust will help NCB \"securitise\" some of its loans, turning them into stocks or bonds that are sold to outside investors.\nThe tie-up with Bankers Trust will also enable NCB to maintain services to its customers after its planned withdrawal from overseas business, the two banks said.\nNCB said that it would also consider a capital tie-up with Bankers Trust, which is on an expansion drive.\n\"We will consider limited capital participation in each other after the ongoing restructuring of NCB's capital is completed,\" the statement said.\nIndustry analysts said such an equity deal would be the first time a foreign bank has taken a stake in a Japanese bank.\nBut they said that it was very unlikely that Bankers Trust would take over NCB.\n\"(The tie-up) will make it easier for NCB to implement its restructuring programme, but its return on equity is too low for the U.S. bank to consider any takeover move,\" said Yoshinobu Yamada, analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan.\nThe market took the news well, with an increase in buying interest in NCB debentures. As one of Japan's three long-term credit banks, NCB raises the bulk of its cash through issuing debentures rather than taking deposits from customers.\nIn a blow to NCB's image, the debentures were recently downgraded to junk-bond status by Moody's Investors Service.\nBut Thursday's announcement won praise from regulators and the markets.\n\"The tie-up will contribute greatly to a smooth implementation of NCB's restructuring plan,\" the Bank of Japan said in a statement.\nThe deal was also cheered by the stock market, with NCB shares surging as much as 30 percent in afternoon trading. There was no trading for most of the day due to a surge of buy orders hitting the market.\nWhen NCB announced its restructuring, President Hiroshi Kubota said the bank was very interested in getting help from a foreign partner, a rare statement for a Japanese corporate leader and seen as a sign of the difficult situation facing NCB in its attempt to get back on its feet.\n", "Russia's net grain harvest will probably fall below official forecasts of 75-77 million tonnes, leading independent industry sources in Moscow said on Monday.\nAndrei Sizov of private agricultural consultancy SovEcon Ltd said he had revised his forecast down to about 68 million tonnes from a previous 70 million.\n\"Russia lost 2.9 million hectares to drought, and since it will cost more to harvest this grain than it is worth, it is likely this area will not be harvested at all,\" he said, adding that the government would be unwilling to spend money on tractor fuel for crops that were essentially already lost.\n\"The Western Siberian harvest is mixed -- you've still got good quality there for the time being, but it's a very slow harvest,\" Sizov said, adding that he saw output there at 9.3 million tonnes.\nHe said it was likely the region would not be fully harvested and that some crops would be left to rot.\nHowever, a senior Western grains source said the government would probably declare the net grain harvest at 72 million tonnes, but that it could in reality turn out to be several million tonnes higher.\n\"They'll declare 72, but remember that they've under-reported the actual total for the last two years,\" the source said.\nA lot would depend on how heavy rains in Siberia affect yields, the source said, adding, \"Some of this stuff is not going to be of very good quality.\"\nA source at the State Meteorological Service said government officials were constantly revising their estimates based on recent weather trends but that they were not making the new forecasts public.\nAn Agriculture Ministry spokeswoman said the ministry was sticking to its forecast of 75-77 million tonnes but said officials would meet Thursday to discuss the pace of the harvest and that the forecast could be revised downwards.\nA source at Rosselkhozakademiya, the state agricultural institute, said the harvest would be slightly below the government forecast, but he declined to give a concrete figure.\n\"It will be a little bit below 75 million tonnes, because it's a very tough harvest in Siberia,\" said the source, who declined to be named.\nArkady Blyumin, head of Informzerno, a grain market research group, said output could be as a low as 70 million tonnes or as high as 75 million. \"Nature may give us something, or it may take it away, and that's where the difference will be,\" he said.\nThe Centre for Economic Trends, an influential institute set up by the government, on Friday forecast Russia's 1996 net grain harvest at 69 million tonnes.\nOne analyst who saw output higher was Boris Chernyakov, head of agriculture at the U.S.-Canada Institute in Moscow. He forecast net grain output at 80 million tonnes, saying producers were hiding how much they had already harvested.\nLast year's grain output was officially 63.4 million tonnes, the worst in three decades.\nThe harvest in parts of Siberia has largely ground to a halt as heavy rains keep crops too wet for reaping, while drought hit sections of the main grain producing areas in the Northern Caucasus and Central Russia earlier in the summer.\n--Moscow Newsroom +7095 941 8520\n", "After arriving late to the Internet party, computer software giant Microsoft Corp has crafted a strategy that poses a serious threat to rival Netscape Communications Corp.\nThe latest version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer software for browsing the vast computer network, launched last week, eliminates the

its high-end Windows NT operating system, taking aim at another key Netscape market.\n\"It's clearly a strategy to cut off any revenue stream that Netscape might have because Netscape does pose a real threat to Microsoft,\" said Phil Lemmons, editor in chief of PC World magazine.  \nWhile the Internet browser market itself is not expected to generate significant revenue, it is a crucial battleground because the browser is seen as the next-generation \"front end\" for the operating system.\n\"Whoever dominates the browser market will determine the direction of the Internet,\" Wallace said.\nHe and others are betting that Microsoft will continue to make inroads as its Chairman Bill Gates tenaciously defends the company's dominance of the personal computer desktop.  \n\"I don't think Netscape is going to do very well in the long run with Bill Gates waking up every morning thinking, 'How can I get Netscape today?'\" said Adam Schoenfeld or research firm Jupiter Communications.\n\"As other companies have painfully learned, when Gates is out to get you he's serious,\" Schoenfeld said.\nNetscape can count on support from software developers and corporate executives eager for an alternative to Microsoft's Windows platform.  \nAnd Netscape has a chance to beat its much-larger rival in areas not dominated by Microsoft products, such as television set-top boxes, video game devices and stripped-down \"network computers\" being backed by Oracle Corp and other Microsoft rivals.\nBut analysts say Netscape faces a tough battle with broad ramifications for the software industry.\n\"It's very hard to bet against them given the amount of resources that they can and are throwing at it,\" Lemmons said. \"Microsoft is a formidable foe, and there's nothing so deep and mysterious about Netscape's technology that it can't be cloned.\"  \nLemmons said that despite Microsoft's near-monopoly in key areas of desktop computing software, the strategy of giving away Internet software appears to be legal, and the company has withstood years of antitrust scrutiny.\nSoftware developers and industry executives will be watching closely as the battle between Microsoft and Netscape continues to heat up over the coming year, Schoenfeld said.\n\"The question for any innovative software company is what can you do that Microsoft can't also do,\" he said.\n\"The damning thing is Microsoft doesn't even have to do it as well -- they just have to do it and leverage their desktop control,\" Schoenfeld said. \"That looms over the entire industry.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t-- Seattle bureau 206-386-4848\n", "Hong Kong's chief judge came under intense pressure to quit the judiciary on Wednesday after stoking the political fire with a bid to become the territory's leader after Britain hands the colony back to China in 1997.\nPoliticians and legal experts said Tuesday's declaration by 67-year-old Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang that he would be a candidate created a conflict of interest and raised a question mark over his role in the British-style judiciary.\n\"It is important to give people the confidence that Hong Kong's judiciary is independent,\" said lawyer Martin Lee, leader of the colony' biggest political party, the Democratic Party.\nLee's view was echoed by prominent pro-democracy legislator Emily Lau, and even by some members of the pro-Beijing camp.\nPro-China politician Tsang Yok-sing said Yang should resign as top judge but welcomed his bid, saying it was good to have more candidates, and especially one who was \"politically neutral and without any business connections\".\n\"He should consider stepping down from his position as Chief Justice. That should happen as early as possible,\" Tsang said, speaking to Hong Kong radio from Beijing.\n\"It will be seen by the public, by people in the legal profession, that there may be a conflict of interests.\"\nNihal Jayawickrama, a law professor at Hong Kong University, said China-born, British-trained Yang had a right to bid for the leadership, but having entered politics he should now resign.\n\"It's not possible for him to hold the office of Chief Justice any longer. It's quite incompatible,\" Jayawickrama said.\nThere are just 300 days before this bustling capitalist territory of 6.2 million people reverts to communist-ruled China, ending a century and a half of British rule.\nNow that Yang's hat is in the ring, with pro-Beijing publisher Xu Simin pledging to nominate him, the leadership stakes have been injected with a new element of competition.\nOther names touted as possible candidates include Patten's Chief Secretary Anson Chan, shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa and a former Hong Kong cabinet member, lawyer T.S. Lo. But Chan is widely believed to be unacceptable to China, Tung has not made clear his intentions, and Lo has no proposer yet.\nA 400-member Selection Committee which will pick the leader and the new legislature is gradually taking shape.\nYang, widely seen as a neutral, independent figure because of his judicial career and as a possible compromise candidate, has said he will resign as chief justice if he is formally nominated.\nBut the earliest Xu can formally propose his nomination is when the Selection Committee is constituted in November and critics say he cannot be chief judge and a politician at the same time and therefore should step down ahead of any formal nomination.\nThe latest twist comes amid signals from Beijing that China is setting aside its bitter quarrels with Britain and possibly with Hong Kong's democrats for the sake of a smooth handover.\nChina's Hong Kong policy boss Lu Ping said in Beijing on Tuesday he accepted that Britain and China might not settle all disagreements by the time of the midnight June 30 handover.\n\"We shall try our best to resolve minor differences before July 1, 1997. If we fail, we can put them aside,\" Lu said.\nHe added that he was willing to shake hands on that day with his arch-rival, Hong Kong's colonial governor Chris Patten.\nThe handover negotiations have been a thorny process. Patten and pro-democracy groups have been quick to dub most of China's moves as anti-democratic in recent years, especially its plan to scrap the elected legislature for an appointed provisional body.\n", "Ending a fierce bidding war for one of the last big merger prizes in the defense industry, General Motors Corp. said Thursday it will sell its Hughes Aircraft unit to Raytheon Co. in a $9.5 billion stock-and-debt deal.\nThe deal, a major setback to losing bidder Northrop Grumman Corp., will create a new missile and electronics giant with about $21 billion in annual revenues and 127,000 employees.\nThe merged company, which will retain the Raytheon name, will become the third-largest U.S. defense contractor, after the merger of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp.\n\"We are truly creating another defense electronics powerhouse,\" Raytheon Chairman Dennis Picard said in a statment.\nGM Chairman Jack Smith said the deal was aimed at unlocking value for GM shareholders and was a response to \"the rapidly changing landscape in the defense industry.\"\nAfter swallowing the Hughes assets, Raytheon will dominate the U.S. missile and radar businesses and will look a lot like the defense specialist it was in the 1970s, before it began diversifying, analysts said.\nHughes and Raytheon make similar products, including missiles, radar, air traffic control systems and other defense electronics.\nHughes, based in El Segundo Calif., makes the Tomahawk cruise missile, air-to-air missiles for fighter jets and the Stinger anti-aircraft missile, among others.\nRaytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., makes the Patriot air defense missile system and competes with Hughes on many other missile contracts. Earlier this month it agreed to buy Texas Instruments Inc.'s defense electronics business for $2.95 billion.\nRaytheon also makes Amana appliances and Beech business aircraft. Picard said the company was taking a \"hard look\" at the future of its commercial businesses and will reveal specific plans in the next couple of months.\nTo help pay for the Hughes deal, Edward D. Jones &amp; Co analyst William Fiala said Raytheon \"will look to spin off or outright sell one of three businesses -- appliances, aircraft and/or Engineering and Construction.\"\nUnder the deal, Raytheon will contribute $5.1 billion in stock and assume $4.4 billion in newly created Hughes debt.\nThe deal involves a complicated tax-free spin-off of Hughes Aircraft to holders of GM's Class H common stock and its automotive stock, known as $1-2/3 par-value common stock. When it is finished, GM-related shareholders will own about 30 perent of the post-merger Raytheon.\nRaytheon executives said the deal will dilute earnings per share slightly in 1997, but will add to earnings in 1998.\nThe transaction does not include the non-defense businesses of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, which the automaker acquired in 1985 for $5.1 billion.\nGM plans to move Delco Electronics, Hughes' automotive electronics business, back into its Delphi Automotive Systems parts operation.\nDelco was brought under the Hughes umbrella in the 1980s as part of then-GM Chairman Roger Smith's grand and controversial scheme to fuse aerospace technology into automobiles, which produced mixed results at best.\nGM CEO Jack Smith, no relation to Roger Smith, told reporters at a news conference in New York Thursday that the automaker will consider a future public offering or spin-off of the new Delphi-Delco unit, but declined to offer a timetable for that transaction.\nHughes Electronics will retain its lucrative telecommunications and space unit, which builds satellites and operates the fast-growing DirecTV satellite broadcasting service.\nGM Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said in an interview that the automaker had no plans to sell any interest in those operations, which are poised for rapid growth in the next several years. Hughes Chairman C. Michael Armstrong will continue to run them.\nProceeds from the $4.4 billion in new debt to be assumed by Raytheon as part of the deal will be transferred to the Hughes telecommunications and space unit to fund future growth.\nThe telcom unit's operating profit for the first nine months of 1996 increased 35.2 percent from a year earlier to $193.5 million, on revenues of $2.89 billion. For all of 1995, it earned $189.2 million on revenues of $3.09 billion.\nThe Hughes defense units posted 1995 operating earnings of $688 million on revenues of about $6 billion.\nThe deal was announced in the last hour of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Raytheon shares closed up $1.50 to $48.50, while GM shares closed up 25 cents $60.375.\nGM's Class H shares, which are tied to Hughes' performance but do not represent ownership in the company, ended unchanged at $62.625.\nAs part of the transaction, GM also plans to recapitalize its Class H stock to link it solely to the telecommunications and space business.\n\"In the past we have felt the market imposed a conglomerate discount to Class H stock because it tracked three businesses,\" Jack Smith told reporters. \"Now the recapitalized Class H stock will track only one high-growth area, telecommunications.\"\n", "China on Tuesday rejected Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's criticism of its proposal to abolish a series of laws in the territory after it reverts to Beijing's control, saying it was an internal affair.\nBeijing also angrily reminded Britain that China was no longer a weak, pre-revolutionary government, and said it would not tolerate other countries trying to impose their will on it.\n\"We cannot accept Patten's so-called statement,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said, referring to the governor's criticism of plans to abolish laws on democratic elections and civil liberties in Hong Kong after the transfer of power this year.\n\"I want to remind the British authorities in Hong Kong that the government of China today is not the pre-1949 government,\" he told reporters, referring to the year of the Communist revolution.\n\"We cannot accept any instances of others trying to impose their will on us.\"\nPatten had condemned a move by a China-appointed panel, known as the Preparatory Committee, to draw up a list of 25 laws and articles for repeal or amendment after the transfer of power at midnight on June 30.\nAfter the handover, the territory that has been a British colony for more than 150 years will become a Special Administrative Region of China.\nThe Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Preparatory Committee had the authority to review existing Hong Kong laws to determine whether they were in conflict with the Basic Law, a mini-constitution drafted by China for the territory.\n\"This is entirely an internal matter for China,\" he said.\nShen also tried to play down the impact of the proposals, saying there basically would be no change to existing laws.\nHe called on the Hong Kong government to avoid making statements that \"misled the public or undermined morale in the territory\".\nPatten had said the proposals, made at a committee meeting in Beijing on Sunday, struck at the heart of Hong Kong's civil liberties and appeared to be politically motivated rather than reflecting real inconsistencies with the Basic Law.\nAmong the laws to be diluted are Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, a 1992 election law, the Societies Ordinance which permits the formation of political parties and a 1995 Public Order Ordinance which allows peaceful demonstrations.\n\"Those laws which conflict with the Basic Law cannot continue as laws of the Special Administrative Region,\" Shen said.\nHe said that if the Preparatory Committee recommended the revision or abolition of these laws, it was reasonable and in the interests of a smooth transfer of power.\nThe spokesman also dismissed as groundless concerns over the independence of the judicial system under Chinese rule.\n", "Guidant Corp expects no material impact on its financial results from a halt in shipments to Europe of its Ventak AV implantable defibrillator, chief executive Ronald Dollens said Tuesday.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Dollens said, \"We don't think it's material. We can't imagine it would be more than $1 million for us, even as a top-line phenomenon, because we feel we'll be back on the market in four to six weeks in Europe.\"\nThe company said Monday it stopped shipments of the heartbeat-regulating device due to technical problems.  \nAbout 200 of the devices have been implanted in people since the Ventak AV was approved for sale in Europe in November. It is not approved for sale in the United States.\nThe problem with the device is mechanical and cannot be fixed by reprogramming, Dollens said. Depending on the patient, if a problem is present and needs to be fixed, removal and replacement would be necessary, he said.\nHe added Guidant does not foresee the situation delaying expected U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance. \"We don't think it will impact U.S. launch timelines,\" he said.  \n\"We expect to have it (on the market) for the majority of the second half of 1997 in the U.S. We're staying with that,\" Dollens said.\nShares in Indianapolis-based Guidant were up 1-1/8 to 56-1/8 following announcement Tuesday of year-end results that saw sales for the year hit $1.05 billion, up 13 percent over 1995. Net income rose 48 percent to $149.9 million on the year, excluding certain one-time items.\n\"When 1997's over, we will be looking at growth rates very similar to what we saw in 1996 on the top line,\" Dollens said.\nSales in the company's vascular intervention segment for the quarter were down year-over-year, but up slightly from the third quarter, he said.\n\"We think we've turned that corner. And we launched two new dilatation catheters within the quarter. So the month coming out of the quarter was much stronger than the month when we entered the quarter. We expect to continue to see quarter-to-quarter growth on vascular intervention sales,\" he said.\n((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787))\n", "Quaker Oats Co. conceded defeat Thursday in its effort to turn around its struggling Snapple beverage unit and agreed to sell it for $300 million -- $1.4 billion less than it paid for the business -- to Triarc Cos. Inc., the owner of rival Mistic beverages.\nThe selling price -- far below the $1.7 billion Quaker paid for the premium beverage company in 1994 -- disappointed Wall Street, but analysts said they were pleased that Quaker did the deal.\n\"It was a fire sale price ... The bad news is the investment has been a disaster, the good news is they're trying to put it behind them,\" said John McMillin, a food industry analyst at Prudential Securities, a brokerage and investment bank.\nSnapple's ready-to-drink teas and juices virtually invented the premium soft drink market and remain a leader, with more than $500 million in 1996 sales. But Snapple has lost money ever since Chicago-based Quaker -- better known for its breakfast cereals and Gatorade sports drinks -- bought it.\nSnapple sales fell 8 percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, the company reported last month.\n\"The decision to sell Snapple was reached after an extensive review of various shareholder value-building options by management,\" said Quaker Chairman William Smithburg in a statement.\n\"After reviewing all possible options, we decided it was in the shareholders' interest to remove the financial burdens and risks Snapple brought to the portfolio and better focus on our value-driving businesses,\" Smithburg said.\nNew York-based Triarc, the buyer, owns the Mistic drinks business, a Snapple rival. It also owns Royal Crown soft drinks, Arby's Inc. fast-food restaurants and other businesses.\n\"With respect to Triarc, this transaction is very positive ... it is complementary to Triarc's existing position in Mistic, which is fruit juices, while Snapple is mostly teas,\" said Michael Branca, a food industry analyst at Lehman Brothers, a brokerage and investment bank.\n\"In addition, Triarc's beverage management is highly respected in the beverage distribution business ... Snapple could well be reborn under Triarc,\" Branca said.\nTriarc Beverage Group Chief Executive Michael Weinstein said his company plans to apply similar marketing principles to Snapple that it used to turn around the Mistic line.\nTriarc will consult distributors and review the consumer research on Snapple, and \"Then we're going to move like hell to do some really cool, innovative things in packaging and product and advertising to try to build the brand back up again,\" Weinstein said.\nTriarc bought the Mistic juices line from a sole proprietor for $95 million in August 1995. It had sales of about $130 million in 1996.\n\"We have a track record in this category with Mistic, of taking a brand that was slumping and applying some basic principles ... to it. We know how to make a brand succeed. We're more entrepreneurial,\" Weinstein said.\nQuaker's stock rose  25 cents to $37.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Triarc rose $1.625 to $17.375.\nQuaker said it would take a non-cash pretax charge of about $1.4 billion, or $8.40 a share, in its first quarter, to record the loss on the sale.\nThe company also said it would be able to recoup about $250 million in taxes paid on previous capital gains, \"making the cash value of the transaction approximately $550 million.\"\nA Quaker spokesman said the tax consideration was a key part of the company's decision to sell Snapple to Triarc now.\nThe spokesman added that Triarc had indicated it intends to transfer virtually all Snapple employees with the business.\nTriarc said it expected to close the deal by the end of June, subject to customary conditions, including government antitrust clearance.\nBesides Snapple, Quaker's other products include Gatorade, which continues to dominate the sports drink market, and cereals, such as Quaker oatmeals, Cap'n Crunch and Life.\n\"Quaker still has the crown jewels -- Gatorade and the cereals -- and performance in those businesses has been pretty good,\" said food industry analyst George Staphos of the investment bank and brokerage of PaineWebber.\n\"The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back,\" said John O'Neil, food industry analyst at BT Securities.\n", "The $25 billion cable TV industry, once considered a major threat to the regional Bells' $95 billion local phone market, is now watering down its ambitions with many projects abandoned or on hold.\nAnalysts say high-speed Internet services offer a more exciting market than local telephone, while the threat of satellite TV has other cable TV firms defending home turf.\n\"I think the cable companies are realizing their core business is in urgent need of strengthening,\" said Peter Kreisky, a consultant at Mercer Management Consulting.  \nMost cable TV firms are weighed with debt, and have put local phone initiatives on a backburner while regulatory and technological uncertainties resolve themselves.\n-- CAUTIOUS CABLE FIRMS LOOK BEFORE THEY LEAP --\n\"I'ts basically a look before we leap,\" said Joann Dobbs, a spokeswoman for Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the largest U.S. cable TV company, which has 15 million customers.\nTCI, Comcast Corp and Cox Communications Inc were partners with Sprint Corp in a grand alliance begun in 1994 to package local and long distance telephone with wireless and cable TV.  \nNow the cable firms' involvement is basically on hold, partly because of technical and regulatory difficulties, but also because Sprint was irritated the cable firms wanted to keep their high speed Internet access plans out of the deal.\n-- INTERNET OVER CABLE SEEN MORE EXCITING THAN TELEPHONE --\nInternet over cable offers much higher speeds than are generally available over the phone system, removing the big frustration of using the web -- delays in page retrieval.\n\"Phone over cable is a me-too product, but high-speed data over cable...has a clear competitive advantage,\" said analyst Rick Westerman of UBS Securities.  \nTelephone regulatory snags still unsolved a year after legal reform include the cost of resale of regional Bell circuits, how universal service will be funded and the size of access charges Bells levy to connect calls to their customers.\nThis has has left in doubt how profitable the local phone market will be for new entrants. While long distance firm have to get into the market if they are to offer packaged services it is not essential for for cable TV.\n\"They were up against very tough competitors in the phone business whose lifeblood was threatened and have a very low cost base,\" said Kreisky.\n-- ONE LESS RIVAL FOR REGIONAL BELLS --\nA cable TV pullback is good news for the regional Bells because cable firms were the only rivals for their local market, which already had access to a significant number of their residential subscribers.\nTime Warner Inc, the second largest cable TV firm with 12.1 million subscribers, this month changed its local phone strategy to concentrate on serving businesses in 18 cities where it already has networks built.\nTime Warner only needs to provide switches to make itself a competitive local access provider in these areas.  \nTime Warner Cable typically invests $1 billion a year, mostly on cable upgrades, and two years ago had been spending in the order of $100 million a year to prepare for entering the Bells local phone markets using its cable TV network.\n\"We are going to maximize the return from our existing (telephone) investment, any additional investment will not be material,\" spokesman Michael Luftman said.\nHowever, Time Warner is pushing ahead with its Road Runner high speed Internet access service, which is operational in parts of Ohio on an upgraded system that cost $120 million.\n-- SOME CABLE FIRMS STILL AGGRESSIVE ON PHONE PLANS --\nMany cable companies retain the long-term ambition of entering the phone market, and some are pushing ahead.\n\"Cox and U S West Media Group are still going to be aggressive operators in telephone,\" Westerman said.\nCox is supporting its Personal Communications Services (PCS) wireless service in California by switching signals captured by receivers through its cable TV network.\n\"We are still intending to offer wired telephone service (too),\" said Ellen East, Cox Communications' spokeswoman.\n-- THREAT FROM DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITE --  \nThe worry for some companies is the success of direct broadcast satellite in picking up customers with offers of hundreds of channels and clear digital signals. The threat is most potent in rural areas, where the cable TV companies will be slow to upgrade, analysts say.\nLong distance firms like AT&amp;T Corp which has a small stake in Hughes Electronic Corp's DirecTV, and MCI Communications Corp which is linked to News Corp's ASkyB see satellite as useful.\nMarket studies suggest that customers are less likely to switch phone provider if they have a satellite TV service as part of the service package.\nCable companies like Time Warner and TCI already have stakes in direct broadcast satellite (DBS) companies which should cushion them from most competitive worries.\nNevertheless, analysts say cable companies are clearly more cautious now than two years ago about what can be accomplished outside their core areas.\n\"They are saying lets stick to what we know how to do,\" Kreisky said.\n((-- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610))\n", "Lloyd's of London is to publish recommendations that the insurance market be externally regulated for the first time in its 300-year history in proposals to be published on Friday.\nAccording to sources at Lloyd's, a working party set up in 1996 to consider market regulation will recommend that it come under the auspices of Britain's top financial watchdog, the Securities and Investments Board (SIB).\nAs well as recommending external oversight, specific proposals will be put forward on how regulation is organised, the sources said.\nAny plans will have to be approved by the new Labour government, but if adopted they would put an end to Lloyd's current system of self-regulation.\nThe changes would require amendments to the Insurance Companies Acts and the Financial Services Act (1986).\nDavid Gittings, Lloyd's director of regulation, said in January that he would be \"surprised\" if the review did not recommend some sort of external overview.\nThe now-ruling Labour party said in the run-up to this month's general election it favoured making regulation accountable to the Department of Trade &amp; Industry (DTI) and SIB rather to the Council of Lloyd's, as at present.\nThe new government is expected to carry out a thorough review of all financial services regulation in coming months. That is likely to include Lloyd's.\nWhile the DTI currently regulates Lloyd's solvency requirements, it is not subject to external regulation on protection of members' interests or the operation of a transparent market.\nA rescue package last year saved Lloyd's from collapse after the huge losses it incurred between 1988 and 1992.\nThe review of the market's regulation was set in motion last October.\nThe panel included representatives from other regulatory organisations as well as from Lloyd's.

Nusamba Group, chaired by businessman Muhammad \"Bob\" Hasan, is 80 percent-owned by three charities headed by Suharto and 10 percent each by Hasan and Suharto's eldest son.\nIn a separate statement, Bre-X's chief of exploration, John Felderhof, said he was shocked and dismayed by the Strathcona report.\n\"I know that I was not involved in a fraud. I also find it very hard to believe that anyone on my staff was involved in a fraud,\" Felderhof said in a statement faxed from the Cayman Islands late on Sunday.\nFelderhof's Busang staff included Michael de Guzman, a Bre-X geologist who allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter on March 19 while en route to a meeting with Freeport officials in Indonesia.\nOn March 26, Freeport said that its preliminary tests found \"insignificant\" amounts of gold.\nAfter the Freeport announcement, Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona, a well-respected Canadian mining consulting firm, to review its Busang project.\nThe announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11).\nBre-X's stock was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday after Sunday's stunning report. But shares in other small Canadian mining companies tumbled as the Bre-X scandal reverberated through the mining community.\nBarry Allen, a mining analyst at Gordon Capital in Toronto, said investors would be very sceptical of future unproven discoveries by Canadian prospectors.\n\"Everyone will go back and re-value and re-look at everything, starting from the ground up,\" Allen said.\nFreeport and Bre-X agreed to develop the Busang site in January after an intense bidding war by several big mining companies for control of the project.\nIn a deal brokered by Indonesian businessman Hasan, Freeport received a 15 percent stake and the right to mine the project. The arrangement left Bre-X with 45 percent, down from an original 90 percent stake, and the rest with the Indonesian government and the Indonesian companies.\nMeanwhile, the mystery of what happened remains.\nThe reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Felderhof and his team of geologists, including de Guzman. The last estimate of 71 million ounces of gold was calculated by assay firm Kilborn SNC Lavalin, which has already said it was not responsible for sampling.\n\"I personally still believe that there are significant amounts of gold at Busang,\" Felderhof said in his statement, adding he would cooperate with authorities investigating the case.\nDisgruntled shareholders have already launched at least eight class-action lawsuits against Bre-X and the Ontario Securities Commission is investigating Bre-X for possible violations of trading and disclosure laws.\nSeveral books are being written about the Bre-X saga and a movie is being planned.\n", "The fate of an acrimonious battle for British utility Northern Electric was still in the balance on Saturday after the panel supervising a bid by U.S. predator CE Electric extended its offer until Tuesday.\nThe outcome of the bitterly fought two-month contest had been expected by midnight on Friday, eleven hours after CE's deadline for investors to accept its 782 million pound ($1.30 billion) offer.\nBut a brief statement by CE's advisors said that following a full hearing of Britain's takover panel the 650 pence a share offer was being extended until 1300 GMT on Christmas Eve.\nOfficials at the Takeover Panel declined to comment, but the Financial Times reported in its Saturday editions that the watchdog had effectively stopped the clock amid allegations of irregularities in the conduct of the bid.\nThe paper said it was beleived CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the United States, had been close to declaring victory when the takeover panel launched a late-night inquiry into the allegations.\nThe nail-biting bid has sparked furious arguments, with both companies protesting to the panel about each other's tactics.\nPrior to Friday's deadline, CE Electric already held nearly 30 percent of Northern, bought on the open market, and had previously declared acceptances that brought its holding up to around 34 percent.\nNorthern has claimed it has the backing of its largest institutional investor, the Prudential, which holds around 11 percent, as well as other funds including M&amp;G and Foreign &amp; Colonial.\nThe bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year.\nNorthern has consistently claimed the CE bid undervalued it and called for a higher price.\nIt said 700 pence per share was indicated in talks before CE Electric launched the offer on October 28, a claim that the U.S. bidder denied. It says it is offering a fair price.\nIf Northern falls to CE, it would be the tenth of the 12 cash-rich Regional Electricity Companies (Recs) set up at privatisation in 1990 to be taken over since the government's protective golden share expired in March 1995.\nIt would also be the fourth to be taken over by an American company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London respectively currently under way.\nAmerican companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining Recs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful English-speaking springboard for expansion into Europe.\n", "The U.S. Commerce Department showed an unexpected degree of flexibility in approving an application from Sybase Inc to export computer encoding products, company officials said on Wednesday.\nAbout a dozen companies have already gotten permission this year to export products with encryption, data scrambling technology that renders information unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"\nBut Sybase's products appeared to skirt strict U.S. export rules in effect since the beginning of the year.  \n\"I was sufficiently surprised when I got word over the phone that we had been approved that I wrote a letter spelling out what I saw as the differences of our approach versus (the regulations),\" said Tom Parenty, Sybase's director of data and communication security. Shortly thereafter, Parenty said, he received written confirmation.\nTo export powerful encryption under the current rules, a company must include features allowing the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys. Companies may export medium-strength encryption by promising to include so-called key recovery features within two years.  \nThe rules indicate that a product must allow key recovery both for encrypted stored data, like a file on a hard drive, as well as for live communications that are encoded.\nBut Sybase's products, Internet transaction software and client-server database programs, will allow for key recovery within two years only of stored data. Encrypted communications between a customer and a web site using the Sybase transaction software, for example, would not allow for government decoding, Parenty said.\nThe key recovery feature was designed to meet the needs of customers, he said.  \n\"Many people want a key recovery mechanism for stored data,\" Parenty said. \"But there is no reason, once I have the answer to my query, to want the keys to decrypt those communications.\"\nSybase still supports legislative proposals that Congress is considering that would eliminate most of the export restrictions, Parenty said.\nThe Clinton administration has opposed loosening the rules, but pressure for change continued to mount this week, as Sun Microsystems Inc announced it would get around the rules by marketing Russian-made encryption with its export products.\nAnd on Wednesday, a group of cryptography experts released a study concluding that the large-scale infrastructure needed to support key recovery for law enforcement agencies could compromise the security of lawful encryption users.\n((--202-898-8312))\n", "When Deng Xiaoping took power in 1979 an urban Chinese needed a year's salary to buy a black and white television.\nWhen he died 18 years later, the average city dweller could afford a refrigerator, a washing machine and a colour television -- some could even buy their own home.\nDeng took over a China wracked by the 1966-76 decade of the radical Cultural Revolution and an economy stultified by three decades of Stalinist central planning.\n\"Let some people get rich first,\" Deng said in an axiom that underlined his rapid-fire approach to the economic reform that marked his rule.\nThe goal of Deng's economic reforms, which he first tried and failed to implement in 1960s, reflected his more pragmatic policies after Mao's sweeping idealism.\nBoth men wanted to keep the Communist Party in power but Deng believed that economic prosperity and money in the pockets of every Chinese would be a safer guarantee.\n\"Without a vision of his own to impose on society, Deng has been willing to adopt policies of non-intervention,\" wrote Barry Naughton in \"Deng Xiaoping: The Portrait of a Chinese Statesman\".\nHe dared to sweep away rigid planning in favour of free market forces, allowed private business into the command economy and decided to open China's door to the rest of the world.\nIn so doing, he saw the average per capita income of urban Chinese soar by 1,500 percent to about 5,600 ($674) in 1995 from 316 yuan ($38) a year in 1978. Earnings of rural residents leapt by more than 2,500 percent to 3,600 yuan ($433) a year in 1996 compared with just 116 yuan ($13) in 1978.\nOn the world stage, its foreign trade has ballooned from an asterisk when Mao died in 1976 to 11th in the world and an engine of Asian growth in 1997.\nDeng's first attempt at reform from 1976 to 1978 was also the first in a series of boom-bust cycles, a recurrent fact of economic reform for years. The economy overheated and had to be reined in as Deng rushed to allow Chinese to get rich.\nBut the tone was set. Deng and his day-to-day policy-makers wanted to revive the economy and they chose to do so by getting rid of over-bureacratisation and allowing greater autonomy.\nThey started by introducing the responsibility system for farmers, under which China's 800 million peasants were allowed to sell on the free market any produce they grew over and above the quota for which they were \"responsible\" to the state.\nAgricultural output skyrocketed, farmers' incomes soared and rural enterprise was born.\nThat success prompted Deng to introduce the \"factory manager responsibility system\" that freed managers from the control of the Communist Party secretary ubiquitous in every state unit.\n\"Whoever is given responsibility should be given authority as well,\" Deng said in 1978.\nHe battled orthodox Marxist ideologues to legalise private enterprise.\nHe set up experimental Special Economic Zones on the coast where foreign investment and capitalist practices were allowed to flourish -- and then to seep into the rest of China.\nHe lifted decades of controls on prices of many items, a move that brought bursts of fierce inflation but also allowed the marketplace to take command and meant that goods filled shop shelves that had been left empty by decades of state planning.\nThe ultimate goal was to force enterprises to take responsibility for their own profits and losses and sink or swim amid market competition.\nMany factories -- some state-owned, many collective and private -- responded to that challenge.\nHowever, many government enterprises have been unable to compete, forcing the state to maintain subsidies to lumbering loss-making national industries for fear mass unemployment could trigger civil unrest to destabilise Deng's fragile new system.\nAbout 70 percent of China's 100,000 state-owned enterprises operate in the red and state banks are burdened with enormous bad debts -- up to 30 percent of their portfolios -- because they must extend policy loans on orders from the government.\nDeng's economic policymakers have tinkered with the spectre of bankruptcy but have repeatedly pulled back from the brink of a solution that raises shades of capitalism.\nThe existence of a quasi-private economy alongside the huge and still-dominant public sector has fostered dislocations such as profiteering, corruption and inflation.\nIntroduction of macro-economic controls has been slow amid reluctance to let go entirely of state levers.\nDeng preferred to set in motion the big picture and to use his unparalleled political clout to push through economic policies rather than to get involved with the policy basics.\nWhen he did, he called on occasion for bolder and faster growth -- preferring what he called \"short-term pain\" to ensure long-term gain but resulting in sometimes harmful policies that had to be followed by periods of moderation.\n\"Deng was a politician, a manager and a generalist whose most successful role was as the political godfather of economic reform,\" Naughton wrote.\n", "Losses have mounted in a stock market slump that has dragged on for years, yet Japanese securities brokers still cling on.\nBut expected liberalisation of brokerage fees could be the final blow for some of the weaker securities houses.\nAnalysts and industry sources say small Japanese brokers are seriously considering closing down amid fears of a plunge in revenues from commission fees, and foreign brokerages are taking a more positive look at the advantages of acquiring local brokers.\n\"The number of Japanese brokers will likely fall to half the current level over the next five to 10 years,\" an official at a Japanese securities house said. \"Many small brokerages are likely to close down or to be liquidated.\"\nAs seen in Europe and North America, some analysts say revenues from commission fees will fall by at least 30 percent within one or two years of deregulation, while others say they could fall by half within the initial year.\nPrime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced a five-year \"Big Bang\" plan last November to enable Japan to catch up with reforms carried out a decade ago in Europe and North America.\nJapan will finalise procedures next month to implement the reforms, which include the timing of liberalising commissions and breaking down barriers between financial sectors. They may also include abolishing a system under which brokers must operate under licences granted by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), analysts say.\nNo Japanese brokers have voluntarily closed and handed back their licences to MOF since the licence system began in 1968.\nBut such moves are now in sight.\nIndustry sources say a small broker based in Osaka, Ogawa Securities Co Ltd, an affiliate of Yamaichi Securities, could be the first to go into voluntary liquidation, as Yamaichi may not give it financial aid.\nOgawa said last Thursday it had no plans at present to stop doing business. Yamaichi, meanwhile, says it is considering how it will deal with Ogawa's difficulties.\nThere are about 285 brokerages in Japan including 56 foreign firms, but only 25 brokers, all Japanese, are listed.\nA senior MOF official told Reuters the ministry would accept voluntary liquidation by brokers. He added that brokerage fees should be liberalised in the final stages of the \"Big Bang\" process after other areas of the securities business have been deregulated.\n\"We are well aware that local brokers would face difficulties unless they are given a certain period of time to prepare for the liberalisation of brokering fees,\" he said.\nIndeed, the financial strength of domestic brokers has deteriorated since the bursting of the late 1980s \"bubble\" of inflated asset prices.\nLast month, the Big Four -- Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi -- and one of Japan's 10 second-tier brokerages, Kokusai Securities, announced parent current profits for 1996/97, ended March 31.\nBut the other nine second-tier brokers all said they expected parent current losses for 1996/97 due to stock price falls. They will announce their earnings figures this week.\nAmong the nine, Dai-Ichi Securities and Yamatane Securities said they would be reporting current losses for the seventh consecutive year.\nAnalysts say many of the second-tier brokers, which depend on stock commission fees for 50 to 60 percent of their revenues, are likely to eventually be acquired by big banks.\nThey also say medium-sized brokers face more urgent restructuring moves this year, such as mergers and seeking outside capital, because by law they must raise minimum capital reserves by the end of next March.\nMeanwhile, one analyst said foreign brokerages and non-financial Japanese firms had begun seriously studying the possibility of taking over local brokers. \"Foreign securities houses are keen to strengthen underwriting and asset management businesses and they want to have more networks to do so.\"\nOne solution for foreign brokerages worried whether they can cut payrolls to boost efficiency would be to increase the number of people working on a commission basis, he said.\n\"Japanese brokerages are now cheap. Even among second-tier brokerages, there are some firms you can buy for about 30 billion yen ($252 million),\" he said.

Central bank officials were not available for further comment.\nTraders are debating whether the central bank, as a complicit part of the plan to be announced on Wednesday, would let the crown depreciate to help a worsening trade situation.\nThe crown, which hit its high in February against the central bank's mark/dollar peg, has been especially sensitive as government pressure for an easing of monetary policy grows.\n\"Traders see the authorities as not opposing a weaker Czech crown, and the authorities are seeing the revaluation (side of the central bank's fixing) band, as overvalued,\" said Petr Korous, a trader at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka.\nKorous said comments by Prime Minister Klaus over the weekend, hinting he was not happy with the crown's higher exchange rate levels, added more uncertainty.\nThe government and the central bank have repeatedly ruled out a direct administrative devaluation of the crown in order to boost exports, although the country's current account deficit now is over eight percent of gross domestic product.\n\"I haven't seen the market this agitated since last September.

Police said leftist guerrillas and four former policemen, jailed for kidnapping and extortion, were leading the disturbance.\nFour prison guards were confirmed dead. A national Prisons' Institute official said the death toll could be higher but security forces had been unable to enter the compound to check.\nThe ringleaders refused to budge on demands for two helicopters to airlift them out of the jail to an undisclosed location, city mayor Tito Pumarejo said.

Bryan Dutton admitted, yes, he had. And General Liu went on to say, 'Well, that this is the image that the world has of us, it is not a correct image of the PLA today',\" Goodwin said.\nHong Kong is reverting to China under a \"one country, two systems\" formula designed by Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who died a week ago.\nThe arrangement, chipped into a 1984 treaty with Britain, allows Hong Kong to keep its free-wheeling capitalist system for the next 50 years.\nGoodwin said General Liu went on to tell Dutton, \"We wish to change the image, and we see Hong Kong as the opportunity to do so because Hong Kong is a window on the world\".\n\"This is positive stuff,\" Goodwin said of the discussions.\nBut Goodwin, speaking ahead of a visit to Hong Kong by British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo, cautioned it would be stretching things to interpret Liu's remarks as an admission that the PLA did wrong in causing the large number of deaths in and around Tiananmen Square in June 1989.\n\"There was no suggestion of that at all,\" Goodwin said.\nIt is unclear how many PLA troops Beijing will station in Hong Kong, although China has signalled it may deploy as many as the British garrison had at peak strength in the 1980s -- about 10,000 personnel from all branches of the armed services.\nThere have been jittery reactions to the imminent presence of the PLA among Hong Kong's 6.4 million people, whose impressions of the Chinese army are indelibly marked with the images of the bloodshed in Tiananmen eight years ago.\nAt that time, one million Hong Kong people poured onto the streets to protest against the crackdown and support the student-led democracy movement in China.\nMany in Hong Kong, citing the PLA's involvement in business on the mainland and abroad, have also voiced concerns that the PLA would get involved in corrupt activities in Hong Kong and that its troops will be above the law.\nChina, however, has been at pains over the past year to portray the future garrison as a model of high morality, including inviting journalists to tour the unit's training base across the border in Shenzhen.\nDutton had revealed the content of his conversation with General Liu to a group of visiting British reporters to show that the PLA had good intentions in Hong Kong, Goodwin said.\n\"The reason Bryan Dutton talks about that particular exchange is to demonstrate that the PLA generally do want to make it work in Hong Kong,\" he said. \"They have created a corps d'elite.

Indirect trade and investment has been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong.\nMany Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nLast month, China called for political talks with Taiwan to end the state of hostility to pave the way for reunification.\nBoth China and Taiwan agree to eventually reunify but on very different terms.\n", "Czech ultra-right Republicans staged a small but noisy demonstration as German Chancellor Helmut Kohl arrived to sign a post-war reconciliation accord between the Czech Republic and Germany on Tuesday.\nAbout a hundred supporters of the Republican Party yelled \"go home\" and \"Czech lands for the Czechs\" as Kohl arrived at Prague's Liechtenstein Palace to sign a joint declaration with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nOther protesters carried banners with slogans such as \"No more Munich\" -- a reference to the 1938 Munich Agreement which ceded the Sudetenland, then part of Czechoslovakia, to Germany.\nKohl waved to the demonstrators as he entered the palace.\nIn the accord, Bonn expresses its sorrow for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague its regret for Czech brutality in the post-war expulsion of some 2.5 million Sudeten Germans.\nIt also includes German support for Czech membership of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Orgainsation.\n\"This document has only one aim -- that is to finish Hitler's drive to the east and finalise the liquidation of our nation,\" Republican Party chairman Miroslav Sladek told the deomstrators.\n\"It is a revision of the results of the World War II,\" he said.\nThe Republicans, who won 18 of the 200 seats in parliamentary elections last June, and the Communists, who won 22, oppose the accord.\nThe communists say the declaration is a threat to Czech sovereignty.\nThe Czech Republic is a leading contender to be one of the first new members of the EU and NATO.

She promised \"intelligent, stylish and popular\" shows from a channel that is hoping to be a hit with the young consumers sought after by advertisers.\nChannel 5 is  owned by a consortium of British firms Pearson and United News &amp; Media plus Luxembourg broadcast group CLT and US investment firm Warburg Pincus.\nIt will go on air on Easter Sunday, March 30, having delayed its launch by three months in order to give it more time to complete the task of retuning the nation's video recorders.\nIt has employed an army of retuners to visit millions of homes across Britain to prevent its signal from interfering with video playback.\nElstein said that Channel 5 should be available to around 40 million people -- just over 65 percent of the population -- at launch in March.\nBut he said this should grow to 45-46 million, or around 85 percent of Britons, by the end of the year as an extra broadcasting frequency comes into operation.\nHowever, he conceded that as many as two million of the 18 million households covered may need to buy new aerials or aerial extensions to pick up the signal clearly.\nMajor areas of Britain will not see the new commercial channel, the first to be launched in this country since 1982. The Scottish city of Glasgow and parts of Wales and the south-west will miss out but Channel 5 hopes to fill in some of the gaps by securing carriage on cable and satellite systems.\nChannel 5 plans what it calls a \"stripped and stranded\" schedule. Behind the jargon lies an attempt to make it easier for viewers to know what is on at a particular time.\nA \"stripped\" show runs on consecutive days, at the same time each day while a \"stranded\" show rotates with other similar shows in the same slot each day.\nChannel 5 will show a daily soap at 1830, its main evening news will be at 2000 and it will have a film at 2100 every evening.

A rate cut would make credit cheaper for them and reduce their debt servicing payments.\nThe annual rate for one-year fixed bank deposits is now at 7.47 percent, down from 9.15 percent last May.\nYear-on-year retail price inflation for 1996 is expected to come in at about 6.0 percent, down dramatically from 14.8 percent in 1995 and well below the original government target of 10 percent, the latest official figures show.\n\"There is still potential for a further bank interest rate cut in the short term, especially given the positive market response to the two cuts last year,\" said Lu Weiming, a state debt trader with China Guotai Securities.\n\"A new cut will also help boost the stock and treasury bill markets,\" he added.\nSpeculation of another interest rate cut have supported prices on the spot treasury bill market in recent days. Analysts cite the rate cut rumours as one reason for the speedy recovery of China's stock markets following sharp falls in mid-December.\nPersonal bank deposits have continued to surge, increasing year-on-year by about 30 percent in 1996 against 1995 to hit around 3.8 trillion yuan ($457.8 billion) by the end of 1996, the analysts said.\nA key barrier to another rate cut, however, is the central bank's reluctance to relax credit with local fixed-asset investment continuing to grow swiftly despite strenuous efforts by the central authorities to keep spending under control.\nOfficial figures show that local governments around China have approved more than 700 new fixed-asset investment projects since July 1996.\nThe State Planning Commission has estimated that fixed-asset investment would hit 2.3 trillion yuan in 1996, about three times the level of 1992.\n\"The markets widely expect another rate cut in the short term but the range might be limited,\" said one investment analyst with China's J and A Securities.\n\"The next cut might be aimed more at having a psychological impact on state-run enterprises and investors rather than a real impact on the economy.\" ($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n", "Sun Microsystems Inc. said Monday it will move to build on the momentum behind its Java computer programming language despite overtures by Microsoft Corp. to co-opt Sun's initiative.\nThe president of Sun's JavaSoft unit, Alan Baratz, said the company will unveil several new initiatives at the second annual JavaOne software developers' conference in San Francisco later this week.\nAt the same time, some developers were buzzing with expectation that Microsoft on Wednesday may spell out its own plans for Java, including some which may not sit well with other Java licensees.\nAs the dominant supplier of operating systems for personal computers, Microsoft is among the more critical licensees of Java, which promises to operate across otherwise incompatible computing systems.\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates is due to address a software developers conference in one hall of San Francisco's Moscone Center the same day JavaSoft unveils its latest initiatives in another part of the same convention center.\nMicrosoft would not comment Monday on its plans, but the showdown follows a months-long tug of war between the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant and Sun's JavaSoft unit.\nEarlier this year, Sun teamed up with International Business Machines Corp., Netscape Communications Corp. and Novell Inc. to launch a \"100 percent pure Java\" branding campaign aimed at ensuring Java retains its ability to work on multiple computer systems.\nThe initiative was designed to keep Microsoft -- or any other licensees -- from appropriating the technology, according to its proponents.\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, complained Sun had deliberately made a new Java version incompatible with recent releases of Microsoft's Windows.\nTwo weeks ago, JavaSoft applied to become a standards-setting body which could submit Java and its various upgrades to become standards under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization.\nAt the time, a Microsoft executive complained Sun was not surrendering the Java branding and compliance process to the standards board, an action JavaSoft retorted would break with industry practice.\nMichael Kwatinetz, the lead analyst in Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's high technology group, said Microsoft's objective is to stay at the forefront of the software development community by continuing to extend its tools into the hot Java arena.\nIn an interview ahead of JavaOne, which starts Wednesday after a Tuesday gathering of Java licensees, Baratz said Sun was introducing a combination of new products and specifications aimed at the server computers used by large organizations for handling computer networks.\nHe also said that, as a separate intitiative, Sun will announce sharply scaled-down varieties of Java -- PersonalJava and EmbeddedJava -- which will be able to work on a variety of small devices.\nThese would bring Java to personal digital assistants such as Apple Computers Inc.'s Newton, copiers and even smart cards, as well as televisions, pagers and cellular phones, changing the definition of what a computer is, according to Javasoft executives.\n\"The momentum behind Java continues to grow,\" said Baratz, adding the JavaOne show is sold out with more than 9,000 developers registered and an estimated 400,000 developers now seriously using Java worldwide.\n", "The restructuring of France's defence sector and the key role of state-owned Aerospatiale in the process are complicating moves by the European Airbus consortium to become a limited liability company, analysts say.\nThe four national firms in Airbus Industrie are studying the best way to convert the partnership into a faster, more efficient company able to compete with U.S. rival Boeing Co, which is merging with McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nAerospatiale, the French partner in the Airbus passenger plane venture, is also involved in two deals at the heart of France's defence industry consolidation -- the merger of Aerospatiale and combat plane-maker Dassault Aviation and the privatisation of electronics firm Thomson-CSF.\n\"It is consistent with French strategic thinking that you must first get your house in order, then negotiate from a position of strength,\" said an industry executive.\n\"Aerospatiale cannot do this today in the Airbus system. It has to have weight behind it. It will have that weight when the Dassault merger is complete,\" he added.\nDASSAULT MERGER WILL BOOST AEROSPATIALE\nThe Dassault merger, due to be agreed this year, will add 13 billion francs ($2.2 billion) of annual turnover to Aerospatiale, creating a group with combined sales of 64 billion and giving Aerospatiale greater clout at the Airbus negotiating table.\nA banker close to the Airbus talks said Aerospatiale is seen as the weakest of the senior Airbus partners -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa). Casa of Spain makes up the fourth Airbus partner.\nBut Aerospatiale will get an injection of aggressive, private-sector management with the Dassault merger.\nAerospatiale executives complain bitterly that the foreign media does not give them due credit for their industrial restructuring which turned the company round to post a 1996 net attributable profit of 812 million francs, after years of losses, and recorded sales of 51 billion francs.\nTheir exasperation is palpable when they say their public sector tag is seen as a weakness when compared to the private sector BAe and Dasa.\nBut analysts point out that Aerospatiale was slower in attacking its cost structure and still needs to improve.\nBAe underwent drastic pruning in the early 1990s, going from an empire with property, cars and military interests to a group focused on defence and aerospace. It posted 1996 pretax profits of 425 million pounds ($690.3 million), on sales of 7.44 billion pounds.\nDasa, although loss-making, has the industrial and financial strength of parent Daimler-Benz AG which has set a management target of a 12 percent return on capital. Dasa posted 1996 turnover of 13 billion marks ($7.6 billion), making it smaller than BAe and Aerospatiale, but it has huge ambitions for Airbus.\nA business consultant said Aerospatiale had excellent programmes, but its military projects were 30 percent more costly than those of BAe and Dasa.\nTHOMSON-CSF SALE ENHANCES PROSPECTS\nApart from the Dassault merger, Aerospatiale also holds a key hand in the Thomson-CSF sell-off.\nThe government has said bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere will have to take into account Aerospatiale's interests when putting together their offers for Thomson-CSF.\nEven though Aerospatiale, as a state-controlled company, cannot take part directly in the privatisation, it will be affected by the outcome and chairman Yves Michot will give his views to the government on the rival bids.\nFrench newspapers have reported that Michot will have to observe strict neutrality in the contest. But it is clear Alcatel's plans would significantly strengthen Aerospatiale, giving it more weight against BAe and Dasa.\nIf Alcatel won Thomson-CSF, it would create a missiles joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, and a satellite venture between Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF.\nLagardere has said it wants a dialogue with Aerospatiale to prepare its bid. Relations between the two firms have been strained as they compete in missiles and satellites.\n\"The perimeter of Aerospatiale is not yet defined,\" said the industry executive.\nThe government plans to decide on the Thomson-CSF bids by June 30.\nAEROSPATIALE NEEDS AIRBUS, WILL MAKE IT WORK\nAerospatiale stands to gain from the defence moves and is in no hurry to bow to pressures from BAe and Dasa to rush into an Airbus agreement which does not suit its own interests.\nHowever, Airbus is vitally important for Aerospatiale. Its 38 percent stake in Airbus contributed the biggest slice of 1996 operating profit, 1.175 billion francs, and around 70 percent of sales.\nAnalysts believe that of the Airbus big three, Aerospatiale needs Airbus the most, and that BAe and Dasa could walk away if relations broke down irreparably.\nBAe has a 20 percent Airbus stake and has bigger military interests, while Dasa's parent Daimler-Benz gets most of its money from the auto business, through Mercedes trucks and cars.\nAerospatiale has, paradoxically, maximalist and minimalist aims for the new Airbus company.\nFor the short term, Michot argues that the present arrangement with Airbus has proved its worth, winning a third of the world market. A much bigger manufacturing concern could overstretch the management, it reasons.\nIn the long term however, Michot would like Airbus to have a military wing, to balance out economic cycles with government contracts.\nThe Airbus partners said in January they agreed in principle on the change to a single integrated company, in which the new Airbus would own its factories and design offices. Work is going on this year on valuing the assets to be vested in the new firm.\nThat valuation is complicated as some of the factories mix civil and military programmes, and some plants are efficient while others are uncompetitive.\nOne way of viewing the Airbus negotiations is through the prism of conflicting cultural visions.\n\"This country (France) has a vision of long-term industrial strategy. It wants to be a world power and be a dominant player in the aircraft industry,\" said the industry executive. Without that vision, Airbus arguably would never have got funds to launch its first plane in the early 1970s.\nSet against that long-term strategic view, is the British insistence on short-term returns for shareholders, summed up as \"Let the City decide\".

With the backing of one of the Eurotunnel shareholders association and Investir magazine, she secured proxies for a blocking minority of 33 percent of the votes.\nThe aim was to ensure the small shareholders' voice was heard as the company negotiated with its bankers on a restructuring of its 70 billion franc ($12.2 billion) junior bank debt.\nL'Helias also acted in 1995 for a New York-based fund, Elliott Associates, which was pushing for the board of a French investment fund, Cie d'Investissement de Paris (CIP), to narrow the discount on its shares relative to net asset value.\nThe following year, the investment bank SBC Warburg consulted L'Helias as it prepared an offer to buy out CIP from majority owner Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).\nBNP, which had launched a buy out for CIP, rejected the SBC Warburg offer, and completed it own buy-out.\nL'Helias was educated at universities in Saarbruck, Germany, Paris' Sorbonne, Pennsylvania in the United States, and gained an MBA at the Insead European business school at Fontainebleau in France.\nShe was a lawyer in a Wall Street law firm in the 1980s buy-out boom and worked briefly in the London office of Merrill Lynch and opened her Franklin Global Investor Services (FGIS) consultancy in 1994.\n\"I am not a shareholder activist,\" she said. She plays an advocacy role, typically retained by a big shareholder who wants her to persuade companies to improve returns. The aim is not to humiliate managements but to use reason and argument. \"Most of the time, the work is quiet and but sometimes it goes public -- like in Eurotunnel,\" she said.\nL'Helias also writes a column on corporate governance in the separate French and Swiss Agefi financial newspapers.

Under the financial bills, it can also borrow a total of two trillion yen ($16.5 billion) from the central bank as stopgap funds.\nBut analysts and even influential politicians are not optimistic.\nTakeo Nishioka, secretary-general of Japan's main opposition New Frontier Party, said in a television programme last weekend that the present deposit insurance system could not cope with bank failures.\nAt the end of September, Japan's deposit-taking financial institutions had 29.23 trillion yen ($239 billion) of problem loans, of which 7.3 trillion yen ($59.8 billion) had not been covered by loan-loss provisions and collateral, Finance Ministry data shows.\nAnalysts say the actual amount of problem loans must be more than double the official figure. If regulators want to deal with insolvent financial firms seriously, there are potentially three measures they can take, analysts say.\nThe first is to boost deposit insurance premiums and the second is the use of loans provided by the Bank of Japan.\nBut the central bank is unwilling to have its money used to bail out financial institutions, and it is difficult to keep on increasing the premiums that institutions must pay the DIC.\n\"So the final source is public money, and politicians are beginning to try to establish measures to cope with the situation,\" said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Center.\nBut it is no easy task to establish such measures after a storm of public criticism that blew up last year over the use of 685 billion yen ($5.66 billion) in taxpayers' money to help resolve bad loans held at collapsed housing loan companies.\n\"The key is whether the authorities can avoid emotional reactions from the public,\" said Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. \"While we believe public money is needed to ensure the stability of Japan's financial system, it may take a long time to reach a decision.\" ($1=122 yen)\n", "A bill to protect homeowners from paying unneccessary mortgage insurance was passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representative Wednesday.\nBy a vote of 421 to seven, the House adopted the Homeowners Insurance Protection Act that would cancel mortgage insurance once the homeowner has built up sufficient equity.\n\"The truth is that a vast number of people are paying for insurance they no longer need,\" Representative Henry Gonzalez said during the debate on the bill. The Texas Democrat urged the Senate to quickly pass the measure.\nConsumer advocates say these policies cost homeowners millions of dollars a year.\n\"I think it would be hard for the Senate to resist moving forward,\" Michelle Meier, counsel for government affairs at Consumers Union, said. The House vote \"brings us really close to getting a final measure.\"\nBut the mortgage insurance industry warned that the automatic cancellation proposal would raise the cost for loans with low downpayments.\n\"Unfortunately, the bill has serious flaws that would impose unnecessary government mandates and controls on the industry,\" said Suzanne Hutchinson of the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.\nCurrently, mortgage lenders require a borrower to obtain and pay for such insurance when the borrower is making a relatively small down payment, such as 5 percent of the purchase price of a home.\nBorrowers putting down 20 percent or more of the purchase price generally are not required to obtain insurance, which can cost $300 to $900 a year.\nThe bill would automatically cancel a mortgage insurance policy if the homeowner was current on mortgage payments and had built up 25 percent equity of the original house value.\nThe bill would not not apply to existing mortgages. The new rules would cover only mortgages and refinancings closed a year after enactment.\n", "Mercury Finance Co.  said Thursday it was suspending payment of a previously announced dividend while it tries to secure short-term financing as it falls deeper and deeper into debt.\nThe troubled consumer finance company said it had been unable to refinance a total of $61 million in commerical paper -- or short-term debt -- that had matured through Wednesday. Another $127 million comes due between Thursday and Feb. 14, Lake Forest, Ill.-based Mercury said.\nThe company has been in violation of certain loan covenants since last week, when it was unable to pay $17 million in commercial debt.\nMercury has been in turmoil since it announced last week that accounting irregularities had caused it to overstate its earnings by about $90 million.\nIt said accounting misstatements appeared to stem from unauthorised entries by former controller James Doyle. But Doyle's lawyer has accused the company of a \"charade\" and said Doyle is cooperating with federal authorities.\nFBI agents served a search warrant seeking financial records Monday.\nMercury said Thursday that it suspended a dividend payment of 7.5 cents a share that was payable March 3.\nThe company also said it was continuing to try to obtain short-term financing from its lenders in talks that have been taking place all week. It added that funds from the short-term financing will be used exclusively for operating purposes and will not be available for paying principal or interest on company debt.\nOne analyst said the apparent lack of a report so far by new auditors on the extent of the accounting discrepancies might be hindering the talks with lenders.\n\"Certainly, (the talks are) complicated in one instance by the default on the commercial paper to date and what seems to be the lack of resolution on the extent and nature of the accounting regularities,\" said Thomas Kmiotek, analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co.\nEarlier this week William Brandt Jr., a turnaround and bankruptcy specialist who replaced John Brincat as chief executive officer on Monday, told Reuters the company needed about four weeks of financing to gain time to stabilise the firm.\nMercury, which makes used-car loans to individuals of often relatively low creditworthiness, also said Thursday that operations were continuing at all of the company's 280 locations nationwide.\nMarket sources said there had been rumours of bids for Mercury's commercial paper at 50 percent to 80 percent of face value. One attorney familiar with bankruptcy matters said bidders might be trying to have more influence if Mercury is forced to file for bankruptcy.\n\"It is not uncommon for investment groups to be buying paper at a discount to improve their situation in a restructuring,\" said Ted Koenig, attorney at Holleb &amp; Coff in Chicago.\nMercury was only one of several auto lenders to report deepening troubles Thursday.\nDallas-based Jayhawk Acceptance Corp.  said Thursday afternoon it would file a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, after saying its revolving credit lender plans to deliver it a default notice.\nJayhawk said last week it took a $15.5 million charge to fourth-quarter earnings to increase its allowance for credit losses after reevaluating the likelihood of recovering advances made to some dealers.\nEvanston, Ill.-based First Enterprise Financial Group Inc. said it did not report 1996 earnings as expected Thursday and that it was reviewing its portfolio in light of recent developments in the industry.\nAn analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. lowered the company's stock to hold from buy.\n\"We believe the Mercury situation is causing audit firms to take a much harder position with automobile finance companies,\" Chicago Corp. said in a research report.\nFirst Enterprise's stock plunged $3.375 to $8.875 on Nasdaq.\nThe fallout from Mercury's financial troubles is also striking a foundation established by Mercury founder Daniel Terra, who died in June. The foundation, which funds the Terra Museum of American Art in Chicago and an American museum in Giverny, France, holds 8 million shares as part of its $350 million endowment.\nThose shares were worth more than $116 million a week ago, but were worth about $21 million Thursday.\nMercury's stock fell 25 cents to $2.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.\n", "Shares in Pearson Plc gained on Wednesday as new chief executive Marjorie Scardino officially took the reins at the diversified British media and leisure company.\nScardino, who becomes the first woman to head one of Britain's leading companies, has already said that Pearson's profit performance has been inadequate and disposals are expected as she aims for greater focus on core businesses.\nPearson shares added 8.5p to 738.5p on Wednesday, reflecting hopes that she will shake up what critics regard as a slumbering giant.\nScardino, a 49-year-old Texan, had been chief executive of The Economist Group, a magazine company half owned by Pearson. A Pearson spokeswoman said Scardino spent her first day \"meeting the troops\" at the company's central London headquarters.\nShe has already met her fellow executives and share analysts are hoping for some swift action to focus a company which is accused by critics of underexploiting a stellar group of assets.\nIts businesses range from the Financial Times newspaper to Penguin books and a television production arm which makes low-budget programmes such as Australian soap \"Neighbours\".\nAnalysts identify Pearson's investment banking interests, its theme park businesses and loss-making U.S. software publishing company Mindscape as the obvious candidates for sale.\nPearson's Tussauds Group unit includes London's landmark Madame Tussaud's waxwork exhibition and theme parks such as Alton Towers in England and Spain's Port Aventura.\nPearson also has a 50 percent stake in London investment bank Lazard Brothers and smaller holdings in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York.\nAnalyst Jason Crisp of SocGen said he thought that Scardino would make quite rapid decisions on which businesses to keep and which to sell. But he added that any disposals would necessarily take time to complete.\nCrisp said that SocGen remained positive about Pearson.\n\"It's not a storming buy but with a good team in place, I think the share price will tend to improve,\" he said.\nPearson effectively has a new management team following changes to the board last year.\nThe process will be complete when Dennis Stevenson replaces Michael Blakenham as chairman in May. Stevenson is currently deputy chairman.\nAnalyst Colin Tennant of UBS shared the view that investment banking, theme parks and Mindscape could be jettisoned.\nBut he said that the new management might find it difficult to drive the share price forward while selling off businesses.\n\"They have stressed they want focus but the problem is there is the possibility of earnings dilution on disposals,\" he said.\nTennant added that he thought Pearson shares \"pretty fully-valued\" at current levels.\n", "China's stock markets began returning to normal on Friday with all markets up in steady morning trade as the negative impact of the death of Deng Xiaoping faded from view, analysts said.\nBoth retail investors and institutions began building positions reflecting the sentiment that Deng's death would actually benefit the markets in the longer term by permanently removing a major negative factor, they said.\nBy midday on Friday, Shanghai's foreign currency B share index was up 0.666 points or 1.03 percent to 65.341 points and the domestic A share index was up 31.437 points or 3.12 percent to 1039.168.\nIn Shenzhen, the B share index rose 3.97 points or 2.76 percent to 147.50 points and the A index was up 2.45 points or 0.7 percent at 353.05 points.\n\"Trading has returned to normal,\" said one Shanghai trader. \"Investors don't believe there will be any major policy change after Deng's death.\"\n\"Some investors believe Deng's death will benefit the markets by removing a major negative factor for good,\" the trader added.\n\"People feel today that there is a stable political transition and the government is gaining credibility,\" a Shenzhen analyst with China Guotai Securities said. \"Medium and long-term investors are beginning to pour in funds.\"\nShanghai brokers said securities houses in the city convened meetings on Thursday and agreed on the necessity to keep the markets moving normally but decided not to intervene to support the markets.\nBut some analysts said they suspected the markets were in one way or another receiving support from institutions under instructions to ensure no major market movements in the aftermath of Deng's death.\n\"I still think there may be some government support in this,\" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. \"The official intention is to ensure that normalcy is maintained.\"\nAnalysts said the relatively short mourning period before Deng's funeral on Tuesday indicated China wanted to dispel the gloom as quickly as possible, helping to creating favorable investment conditions.\n\"The stock markets in China are more closely related to political conditions,\" said another Shanghai trader. \"The impression that China's is on the right track of a smooth transition has helped the markets to recover swiftly.\"\nOther brokers have warned that there was still potential for markets volatility in the short term.\n\"I will have to wait until the end of the mourning period to see clearly where the market is heading,\" the Shenzhen-based analyst said.\n", "China's offer to return a hijacker to Taiwan has raised hopes of an easing of tension between the two rivals but it is likely to be only a small step in closing their wide gulf, analysts said on Thursday.\nThey said Beijing has allowed itself flexibility by not saying when it would return the unemployed journalist who is alleged to have commandeered a Taiwan airliner 10 days ago.\nTaiwan, which holds the trump cards in this round of their diplomatic game, may also be trying to use the issue to force a resumption of formal talks with China, broken off in mid-1995.\n\"It's an interesting and encouraging development in that they are still talking to each other on practical matters,\" said a Western diplomat with long years of China experience.\n\"But it's no major concession,\" he said. \"There's likely to be more people hijacking in the opposite direction.\"\nChina on Thursday gave in to Taiwan's demands to repatriate Liu Shan-chung, but demanded the island send back 16 Chinese hijackers in return.\nIt did not give a date for the return of Liu, who is suspected of forcing a Taiwanese airliner to fly to China's southeastern city of Xiamen. The plane, crew and all other passengers were returned the same day but China has held the hijacker in custody.\n\"Liu Shan-chung... will be repatriated to Taiwan after necessary investigations are made,\" the official Xinhua news agency said, quoting China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.\nThe semi-official association handles bilateral ties in the absence of formal links between Beijing and Taipei, rivals since the communists won the Chinese civil war and drove the defeated Nationalists into exile on Taiwan in 1949.\nThe association said China was repatriating the hijacker in line with an agreement reached in 1990, but which was never signed.\nTaiwan has jailed 16 Chinese for hijacking 12 airliners to the island between April 1993 and June 1994. It has offered to return two of them.\n\"Beijing is more eager to see an end to hijackings,\" said another diplomat in Beijing. \"That gives Taiwan leverage on this issue.\"\nTaiwan welcomed Beijing's announcement but declined to signal any further response.\n\"This will be positive for our future talks on hijacker repatriation,\" said Jonathan Liu, a director of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council.\nBut he said Taiwan would wait for formal notification before it decided on its next move.\nTaiwan has banned direct air and shipping with China for almost five decades, and insists such links must go through a third territory, mainly Hong Kong.\nChina has been pushing for direct trade and transport links though Taiwan has been using these as key bargaining chips on any talks on the future relations of the two rivals.\nTaipei wants to see a resumption of semi-official talks, broken off by China after Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui made a private visit to the United States in 1995. The visit angered China, which views the island as a renegade province that is not entitled to official contacts with other states.\nForeign analysts in Beijing said that the timing of the announcement on Liu's return to Taiwan had some additional political mileage for Beijing.\nIt was made shortly before the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, starts a visit to the island.\nChina has warned Taiwan against using the visit to further its political ends.\n", "The outgoing vice-chairman of Czech Skoda Auto a.s., a unit of Volkswagen AG , rejected as \"nonsense\" on Wednesday a German magazine report connecting him to a VW bribery affair under investigation.\nVolkhard Koehler was unexpectedly replaced on Skoda's board last week, and a subsequent story in the weekly Der Spiegel said it was because he had prevented an investigation into a bribery affair linked to VW employees and was involved in dubious real estate transactions.\nA Skoda spokesman, Milan Smutny, said in a statement on Wednesday that Koehler had spoken to economic corruption investigators in the German city of Braunschweig who confirmed that he was not the subject of any investigation.\n\"The state prosecution office confirmed that (Koehler) is not the target of any investigation,\" Smutny said. He quoted Koehler as saying Der Spiegel's claims were \"absolutely nonsense\".\nVW chairman Ferdinand Piech said last week that corruption allegations, which centred on a plant expansion contract for Skoda awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB , involved \"a nearly double-digit sum in the millions of marks\".\nHe said a probe into allegations that VW employees have demanded and received bribes in return for contracts, had so far turned up only one employee who has since been suspended.\nThe employee was not named.\nPiech said the figures involved are well below German media reports that have said the contract was worth some 400 million marks and included bribes of about 20 million marks.\nVW said its purchasing division in the summer of 1994 approved a 74 million mark contract for a Skoda paint factory and a second contract worth 38 million marks to expand the facility.\nSmutny said that all decisions on purchases over 100,000 marks at Skoda had to be approved by officials at Volkswagen headquarters in Germany.\nGerman prosecutors in Braunschweig have said they were investigating two suspects as part of their probe at VW, brought about by the carmaker in a formal legal request.\nSmutny said Koehler was expecting another assignment from VW headquarters in Wolfsburg after his stint with Skoda ends on April 15. He said that the non-renewal of his contract conformed to standard Volkswagen practice.\nThe functions of Skoda board members named last week will be announced in a news conference on April 3, Smutny said.\n", "Fourth quarter results from Sprint Corp showed extremely strong growth in the core long distance and local phone businesses, but earnings trailed consensus estimates because of dilution from new ventures.\n\"I was pretty pleased. It continues to show strong core growth offset by increased dilution from new ventures,\" said Simon Flannery, an analyst at J.P. Morgan.\nSprint's volume of business in long distance jumped 20 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, and operating margins improved.  \nLocal calling was less outstanding, analysts said, but included a 5.6 percent increase in lines to customers and a 40 percent increase in revenues for smart phone features like Caller ID and voice dialling.\n\"The core business was an absolute blow-out,\" said Michael Elling of Prudential Securities.\nThe stock rose 1/2 to 40-3/4 by midsession.\n\"Investors continue to focus on the strong core growth and the prospects of the emerging businesses,\" said Flannery.  \nSprint is now gearing up to add thousands of PCS and Internet subscribers in 1997, when its vision of a package of services on one bill should reach fruition.\nSprint produced $0.57 earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with a loss of $0.98 a year ago. Analysts added  back an $0.08 charge for comparison with their projections, reaching $0.65 in the quarter.\nThat was four cents below their consensus of $0.69 carried on First Call, which already assumed considerable dilution from new ventures like Personal Communications Services (PCS) wireless and Global One.  \n\"That four cents could be placed at the feet of one product, the Internet roll-out,\" said Elling.\nGlobal One, an international venture jointly owned with Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom, cost Sprint $0.05 a share in 1996's fourth quarter up from $0.02 a year ago, but costs should decline from now on, analysts said.\n\"The true-up at Global One seemed to be worth about two cents per share,\" Flannery said, referring to a fourth quarter catch up to costs incurred earlier.  \nSources close to Global One last week told Reuters that the venture had racked up almost $370 million of losses in 1996 instead of $250 million budgeted. Neither Sprint nor Global One would confirm these figures.\nThe venture serves multinational firms telecom needs and carries traffic for other telecom firms.\nThe cost of all the new ventures was around 20 cents to Sprint in the fourth quarter, according to Richard Klugman, an analyst at PaineWebber.  \n\"You will not see the return on these (investments) until 1999 at the earliest,\" said Klugman. However, like other analysts polled he backed the company's strategy. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))\n", "France Telecom has been ordered by France's new telecommunications supervisor to review a proposal for a list of prices it will charge its future competitors for the use of parts of its infrastructure.\n\"We have had a meeting will all the operators yesterday. We are waiting for a new proposal by France Telecom,\" Jean-Michel Hubert, president of the new ART regulator, said during the body's first news conference on Thursday.\nThe catalogue of so-called interconnection charges is going to be a key element both for the economic viability of future entrants into the French market as well as for the value of France Telecom, slated for partial privatisation this spring in the biggest French market float ever.\nHubert said that he hoped to be able to render opinion of the Autorite de Regulation des Telecommunications (ART) on the draft decree on interconnection at the start of February.\nTelecommunications Minister Francois Fillon aims to publish the final decree before the end of that month.\nAs far as the actual price list is concerned he hoped the five-strong body could take a decision \"as soon as possible\" and added it should be before the partial sale of France Telecom.\nHe declined to be specific about what kind of changes ART was asking from France Telecom -- the other operators are demanding drastic price cuts from an original proposal -- only saying that he wanted to be \"equitable\".\nHubert noted that there was \"only a small window\" between a price structure at which competition was impossible and another at which competition would be \"ridiculous\".\nHe added that while ART would take account of international comparisons, because he believed there would be a move to harmonise these costs internationally, he said such a comparison should not be the norm for a decision.\nART started its legal life on January 6, taking over the regulatory and licencing authorities that were previously the prerogative of the Ministry of Telecommunications.\nART is indepedent and will also have to act as an arbitrator in case of disputes between various operators.\nIts five members -- appointed by the presidents of the republic, senate and parliament -- cannot be sacked nor can they seek a new term. Apart from Hubert, the members are Dominique Roux, Yvon Le Bars, Roger Chinaud and Bernard Zuber.\nHubert said that a difference with Britain's OFTEL was that ART will take decisions as a college while at OFTEL the director-general has the decision-making power.\nAsked whether ART would make life as difficult for France Telecom as OFTEL has made that of British Telecom Plc, Hubert said only that he expected \"hard and difficult talks with all operators.\"\nHubert said he wanted to promote growth of the market, which would boost economic growth and jobs. He said he had the interests of the consumer in mind and noted the existence of ART alone as an unbiased regulator was an incentive to competition.\nBut he made it clear that ART would also come to the aid of France Telecom, or other French operators, as far as international matters were concerned. ART still needs to appoint a director of international affairs but Hubert said the matter was very important and had to be based on reciprocity -- if French operators find obstacles abroad, ART could be engaged in the negotiations.\nHubert is travelling to London on Monday to meet OFTEL's Don Cruickshank and other international counterparts. He said much of the international negotiations would need to be done on a European level while the EU member states would want to harmonise their regulation in a single telecoms market.\nHubert said that ART was following closely discussions between France Telecom, Generale des Eaux unit SFR and Bougues Telecom about the cost of interconnecting mobile telecommunications but said ART had not been asked to arbitrate in the matter.\n\"I hope the operators come to an agreement,\" he said.\n", "The Toronto Stock Exchange's move to decimal trading from fractions this year has not boosted trading volume as hoped, a study has shown.\nThe conclusion was contained in a July discussion paper by doctoral student Jeff Bacidore at Indiana University's Graduate School of Business and recently obtained by Reuters.\nThe TSE is Canada's largest stock exchange and is third-ranked in North America. All of Canada's five equities markets except for Winnipeg adopted trading increments of five cents rather than one-eighth of a dollar on April 15.  \nTSE officials said they made the move in hopes of attracting business away from U.S. exchanges. Many overseas exchanges also use decimal trading increments.\nBut Bacidore found trading did not increase in the nine week period after the change compared to the previous nine weeks.  \"Statistically speaking, the volume is about the same,\" he told Reuters in a phone interview.\nHowever, Susan Crocker, the exchange's senior vice-president of equities and derivative markets, said the study was too short. \"What occurs to generate volume on any given day? Like a million things,\" she said.  \nBecause the time periods were so short, \"I don't even know how you can draw that conclusion,\" Crocker said.\nBacidore said the time frame avoided seasonal fluctuations.\nScotiaMcLeod senior vice-president Fred Ketchen, a proponent of decimalization and former TSE chairman, agreed with Crocker. \"It is too early to make that assessment.\"\n\"The move to nickel spreads has prompted an increase in the number of market orders coming into the market as opposed to limit orders,\" Ketchen said. \"That isn't going to show in the electronic book as far as the liquidity is concerned.\"  \nBacidore said his data set was too limited to be broken down into the different types of orders.\nHis study also found that decimalization cut earnings for traders, who made higher profits from the previous wider spreads between prices.\n\"It's just like any good: if you lower the price, you're going to lose money on each share but volume picks up enough, if you sell more of the product, you could actually compensate for that per unit loss,\" Bacidore said. \"In this case the per unit cost of trading fell, but the volume didn't pick up.  \nKetchen added that \"If you have a one-eighth of a dollar spread, and you can bring that down to a nickel, you've got to be helping somebody.\"\nCrocker agreed. \"Spreads have narrowed and investors have certainly benefitted.\"\nBacidore, who said he was interested in decimalization because U.S. markets are considering abandoning their systems to join an international movement, said his next step is to see if Toronto is attracting volume away from U.S. exchanges.\nThe exchange is also studying the effect of decimalization but is unlikely to publish its results, Crocker said.\n-- Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100 or lydia.zajc@reuters.com\n", "Talks to try to resolve the fate of a high-level Pyongyang defector who has taken refuge in Seoul's mission in China entered an eighth day in Beijing on Wednesday amid signs the North may let him go.\n\"Negotiations in various channels are going on,\" South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik said of the crisis centred on North Korean ideologue, Hwang Jang-yop, who is marooned at Seoul's heavily-guarded consulate in Beijing.\nChang declined to reveal whether China, dragged as an unwilling third party into the latest crisis in the world's last Cold War standoff, was involved in the discussions.\nHe also hinted at doubts over reports that the Stalinist North was ready to abandon attempts to recover Hwang, ranked 24th in the hierarchy of the Stalinist state and a senior aide to top leader Kim Jong-il.\nA major Japanese newspaper reported that a top North Korean official visiting Beijing had said Pyongyang would not fight the defection of Hwang, who sought refuge in Seoul's Beijing mission last Wednesday.\nKim Jong-u, head of North Korea's Overseas Economic Cooperation Committee, indicated at a meeting with international investment groups in Beijing that Pyongyang was ready to let Hwang go, the economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.\n\"That is what the government has decided,\" it quoted Kim as saying. \"The matter is already closed. He has already been dismissed.\n\"Betraying the people when the country is in great difficulty is an unforgiveable act. Because of his old age we will not pursue him,\" the newspaper quoted Kim as saying.\nSouth Korean embassy officials said they were aware Kim Jong-u was in Beijing but could not confirm his statements.\n\"We don't know about his intentions or activities in Beijing,\" the embassy's Chang said.\nSeoul officials were still analysing a statement released by Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry on Monday hinting that the enigmatic country was softening its hardline stance on the betrayal by one of its top ideologues, Chang said.\nIn a sign that Pyongyang could be coming to terms with the Hwang's loss, the Foreign Ministry had said North Korea would take strong action if Hwang was kidnapped, but that he would be fired if he had spurned his Stalinist homeland.\n\"It will take time to clarify the real meaning of the statement,\" Chang said.\nPyongyang officials had steadfastly maintained that the South abducted the scholarly architect of North Korea's governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance. Seoul has dismissed the charge as preposterous.\nThe new tone on Hwang's departure appeared to be backed by comments by North Korean leader Kim Jong-il broadcast on state radio that \"cowards\" should get out.\nHowever, China appeared nervous about Pyongyang's intentions, stationing three armoured personnel carriers in the sedate streets around the mission where Hwang is marooned.\nA crowd control truck armed with water cannon and a bullet-proof car have been parked outside the mission for days while officials seek an end to the impasse.\nBeijing, in a quandary over how to usher Hwang out of China without angering an old communist comrade or a new capitalist friend, has repeated its plea to both to act with restraint to resolve the affair.\n", "British electricity company Northern Electric brought forward half year results and gave year forecasts on Friday in a bid to prove it is undervalued by CE Electric's 630 pence a share bid.\nThe regional electricity company, or Rec, said pretax profits for the six months ending September 30 slipped to 50.7 million pounds ($85.12 million) from 58.7 million pounds and an interim dividend of 12.85 pence was paid out, up from 12 pence.\nFull year pretax profits would be above 112 million pounds, the company said, with a final dividend forecast of 29.85 pence.\nNorthern, which last year fended off a bid from Trafalgar House, now part of Kvaerner, with a 560 million pound benefit package, said gearing should fall to 95 percent by March 31 compared with forecasts last year of 175 percent.\n\"Gearing is falling and that is good news...today's results were not about profits but about the financial state of Northern Electric,\" said one trader.\nNorthern's chairman David Morris told Reuters there would be more information to come, pointing out prospects and highlighting areas of value.\nHe said talks with CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., would be based on a share price of around 700 pence, a level it claims the American company indicated before the bid was launched in October.\nCE Electric denied that claim and went on to snap up nearly 30 percent of Northern as its shares languished, weighed by concerns that the U.K. government will block the bid.\nA spokesman for CE Electric described Northern's results as \"lacklustre.\"\n\"I do not think they have announced anything that is going to make CE Electric put its price up,\" said one sector analyst who asked not to be identified. Shares in the Rec slipped one penny to 589 pence by 1100 GMT.\nNorthern said gearing, without payment of a special dividend of 56.5 pence due in February under last year's defence package, would be roughly in line with other electricity companies.\nIt argued that based on the forecast cash flow for 1997, it should be valued at 745 pence a share to balance the current agreed bid for Rec East Midlands Electricity from Dominion Resources of the U.S.\nThat bid valued East Midlands at 670 pence per share but its stock was also dampened by government approval worries and was trading at 609 pence, up 1.5 pence.\n\"We are simply pointing out the value of Northern Electric,\" Morris said, adding that if the government approved the bid, the figures would be more fully appreciated.\n\"You will see a vast change then,\" Morris said.\nNorthern has said it felt the government should approve the bid but maintained that 630 pence did not represent its true value.\n\"These results and forecasts help to demonstrate that there is significant further value within Northern Electric, value which CE Electric's offer fails to reflect,\" Morris said.\nSome analysts said the results and forecasts underlined the judgement that CE Electric's bid undervalued the company.\n\"The company is worth something around 670 pence, if you exclude the bid premium and shareholders should hold out for something nearer 700 pence,\" said one analyst, anonymously.\n($1=.5956 Pound)\n", "Investors in Britain's growing band of listed soccer clubs have recently experienced that sinking feeling all too familiar to long-suffering fans.\nShares prices have fallen faster than a relegation-bound team as the euphoria surrounding potential earnings from sources like pay-per-view television gives way to more sober analysis.\nThe sector has lost around 30 percent in the last six weeks or so, smaller clubs such as premier league strugglers Southampton and first division Sheffield United among the biggest losers.\nHowever, even English champions Manchester United have seen their share price fall from a January high of 737p to its current level of 630p, this despite continuing success on the pitch at home and in Europe.\nShare analysts who follow the financial fortunes of the clubs point out that these falls must be seen in the context of spectacular rises of 200 percent and more since early 1996.\nTheir view is that investors are backing a winner if they stick with the big clubs but that people should think twice before putting money into clubs outside of soccer's elite.\n\"We believe a derating of the smaller clubs is inevitable and could be marked. These are the footballing bubbles that will fade and die,\" UBS analysts Guy Feld and Julian Easthope wrote in a recent report on what they call \"UK Football Plc\".\n\"In England, Premier League status will be essential, and the cost of being outside it will increase, because of the increasing concentration of TV revenues at the top end of the game,\" they added.\nPay-per-view television is seen as a major benefit to only the creme de la creme of the British and European game.\nUBS selected a top 10 UK soccer franchises, featuring listed clubs Manchester United, Leeds United, Glasgow Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur.\nTwo more of their tips, English premier league clubs Newcastle United and Aston Villa, will join the market shortly.\nAnalysts expect heavy interest in both those clubs, given their strong fan base and established position among the most successful teams in the country.\nAnalyst Nick Batram of Greig Middleton agrees that share prices of some of the smaller clubs could fall further.\nBut he believes that clubs can make money outside the premier league, providing they do not overstretch themselves.\n\"They have to look at being profitable in the lower divisions rather than gambling on getting in the Premier League,\" he said.\n\"Millwall is unfortunately a good example of what happens when you speculate on promotion,\" he said.\nSecond division Millwall were forced to call in the administrator in January after running up debts of 10 million pounds ($16 million).\nThe south London club had signed players on lucrative contracts in a bid to join the 20-club premier league elite but ran into financial problems when the club went down rather than up at the end of last season.\n", "Boeing Co. plans to enter the airline maintenance business within the next several months as part of a drive by the jet manufacturer to develop new business opportunities, a top executive said Friday.\n\"It's one of the things we're looking at, and I'm quite sure we're going to do it,\" said Larry Clarkson, president of Boeing Enterprises, a new division of the company's commercial airplane group.\nClarkson said in an interview the company is negotiating with several potential partners, which he declined to identify, and might begin by forming a joint venture to provide maintenance for airlines that want to use outside contractors for the business.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Boeing was pushing to take over the heavy-maintenance operations of several major carriers, possibly including British Airways Plc, but Clarkson said any such transaction would be a long way off.\n\"When it comes to, say, taking over the total maintenance of a major airline, it's going to take us a while,\" Clarkson said. \"It's a very complicated thing to do.\"\nA spokeswoman for British Airways declined comment.\nIndustry analysts said a move by Boeing into maintenance would make sense as a way to diversify the company's business beyond highly cyclical airplane manufacturing and weapons systems.\n\"If you can get into that business without stepping on your customer's toes I think it's a great idea,\" said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.\nHe and other analysts said the move was a reflection of Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit's efforts to diversify Boeing while the manufacturer is enjoying a record wave of new orders.\n\"This is a reflection of Phil Condit and his more aggressive nature than his predecessor and a reflection of the internal thinking that's going on as to where best could they deploy the huge amount of cash they're going to have on hand,\" said Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.\nBoeing had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of last year, and Nisbet estimated that with the company's expected acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. this year it will generate at least $1.5 billion in excess cash annually over the next several years.\nLast month Boeing Enterprises announced a $200 million joint venture with FlightSafety International to offer pilot and ground crew training. FlightSafety is a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\nThe Boeing unit, formed in January, also has been exploring ways to profitably use the company's massive database of world airline inventories to help carriers maintain service records.\nBoeing fell $1.75 to $100.375 on the New York Stock Exchange amid a drop of 148 points, or more than 2 percent, in the Dow Jones industrial average.\n", "Apple Computer Inc.'s chief scientist said the company is seeking to generate outside investment in its Newton computer group, especially for its hot eMate product.\nApple Chief Scientist Larry Tesler also told Reuters in an interview here late Thursday that Apple is looking to find new homes for at least a dozen technology projects it recently decided to stop funding.\nThe Newton unit was spared the ax in last month's restructuring, despite speculation it would be scrapped.\nIndeed, although early versions of the highly-touted Newton fell short of the mark four years ago, Tesler said Apple is getting rave reviews for its latest offerings.\nDemand for its eMate, a version of the Newton in a stylish clamshell case with a keyboard for schoolchildren and priced around $800, was particularly strong, he said.\nA small group of Apple executives have been charged with exploring alternatives to increase investment in the Newton business while the company is slashing spending elsewhere in a bid to return to profits, he said.\nTesler declined to talk about individual companies which Apple may have approached, and said he is not directly involved in the group's day-to-day efforts, but that they had entered the process with \"an open mind.\"\nThe group was prepared to consider a broad set of options, he said, although he would not say specifically whether these could include a joint venture or some sort of manufacturing or distribution deal, for example.\n\"We are pleased by the reception for the eMate and looking at how we can increase our investment in it at the same time as we lower expenses of the company,\" he said.\nApple's lead scientist said talk of scaling back or exiting the Newton business, which helped Apple pioneer the handheld computer market despite its bumpy start, was off target at a time when \"it's just hitting its stride.\"\nIn mid-March, Apple set out to cut spending by an average of 25 percent across the company while abandoning support for an array of technologies in its research labs.\nApple has said it would cut a total of 4,100 jobs and take a $155 million restructuring charge in the second quarter to the end of March. Apple is due to report its second quarter results on April 16.\nTesler said Apple was looking for ways to keep its discontinued work alive by licensing it, for example, to third parties \"so these technologies can come to market.\"\n\"They're not ones that fit our business model, but they're ones that we think are good and ought to come to market,\" he said. \"We have one or two dozen technologies that Apple has decided to discontinue and (it is seeking to farm them out) rather than seeing them wither.\"\nTesler declined to give details on what these further technologies were, other than the outline given last month in the company's restructuring announcement, and he said the method of seeking new sponsors to further develop and market the technologies would differ according to each.\nTesler was attending the Sixth International World Wide Web Conference in Santa Clara, where he gave a presentation to a crowded audience on some of the hottest new Internet technology for use on Apple systems.\nSpeculation that Apple might part with its Newton division re-emerged on Thursday after USA Today reported Apple was in talks with Sun Microsystems Inc. over the possibility Sun might buy the Newton unit.\nThe newspaper reported Sun could be a tough bargainer and said no deal was imminent. Neither Tesler, Apple nor a spokesman for Sun Microsystems would comment on the report. Sun said it does not comment on speculation.\nSun Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy said last week he would not comment on acquisition rumors, including those about Apple. He said that in general Sun will remain \"opportunistic\" in evaluating any deals that come its way.\nEarlier this year Advanced RISC Machines Ltd.

It took a post-tax charge of 114 million guilders as it reorganised its music operations.\nIts dividend was held at 0.95 guilders per share.\nLevy said PolyGram expected to resume earnings growth in 1997 but would not specify by how much.\nThe results topped market forecasts and PolyGram shares surged 6.50 guilders to 89.80 on the Amsterdam bourse.\nAs part of the restructuring, the company said it was cutting around 550 jobs, an increase on the forecast of 400 job losses made when the move was announced last October.\nChief financial officer Jan Cook said the restructuring would pay off in two or three years, the staff cuts trimming the annual wage bill by some 50 million guilders.\nPolyGram is revamping its Motown unit, moving the famous soul music label's headquarters from Los Angeles to New York as it seeks to recreate its heyday of the 1960s and early 1970s.\nIt is reorganising its European music distribution and marketing and restructuring its classical music division.\nPolyGram music increased sales by five percent to 7.95 billion guilders but operating profit fell three percent to 1.11 billion.\nThe PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (PFE) unit, set up  five years ago, crept into a two million guilder operating profit in the second half of last year. Full-year operating losses fell to 35 million guilders from 68 million in 1995.\nBut Levy said the unit would not make a profit in 1997 because of the costs of setting up a distribution operation in the United States and a move to bigger budget films.\nPFE has won 14 Oscar nominations this year for films such as Fargo, The Portrait of a Lady, Sleepers and Trainspotting.\nPolyGram is listed in Amsterdam and New York, with many of its senior executives based in London.

Verifone stockholders will receive one HP share for each VeriFone share, the company said.\nThe acquisition is a big step in HP's drive to develop products for what it calls the \"on-ramps\" and \"off-ramps\" of the information superhighway, a business that includes computer printers and scanners, where Hewlett-Packard already has a dominant market share.\nIn an intervew last week the company's top Internet executive, Ira Goldstein, said Hewlett-Packard aimed to become the information appliance supplier to the fast-growing market for Internet technology.\nThe Internet portion of the electronic commerce market alone is expected to reach $95 billion in the United States by the year 2000, according to research by International Data Corp.\nHP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year.\nThe acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. As of Monday, VeriFone had 23.3 million shares of common stock outstanding, the companies said.\nHP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.\nVerifone jumped $17.625, or 59 percent, to $47.75 in very heavy trading on the NYSE, after initially being halted, as investors priced in the value of the stock swap.\nRedwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone, which was founded in 1981 and pioneered automated credit card transaction systems, has recently expanded to include conducting business over the Internet and \"smart-card\" products for homes.\nSmart cards have imbedded computer chips that can store so-called electronic cash and other information.\nJust last week, Citicorp's Citibank launched a pilot programme with VeriFone to test smart card use that will allow selected customers to download funds onto smart cards using devices in the home or office.\nVeriFone estimates that its systems handled more than $520 billion of the $800 billion in electronic transactions conducted in the United States last year.\nHP said the two companies' technologies complement each other, with HP's focus on Internet security technologies and major corporate markets melding with VeriFone's expertise in moving money.\n\"Central to HP's strategy to achieve this vision is the ability to move money securely from end to end over the Internet, an area VeriFone has pioneered through products and strategic relationships,\" HP Executive Vice President Rick Belluzzo said.\nThe companies' relationship also includes providing products for the Visa/MasterCard Secure Electronic Transaction protoco, which is beginning to roll out this year, for secure credit-card payments over the Internet.\n", "International Business Machines Corp.'s $23 billion Global Services business will become a separate IBM group, the company announced Wednesday, acknowledging the significance of the fast-growing business.\nIn a related development, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner reiterated in the company's annual report an earlier statement that it planned to hire \"thousands more\" employees to fuel growth, most of them in Global Services.\nIBM told analysts earlier this year it will probably add as many new employees in 1997 as it did in 1996, with a big chunk in Global Services.\nIn 1996, the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant's worldwide head count grew to 241,000, up from 225,000 in 1995, mostly due to the expanding services business, an IBM spokesman said. In 1995, employment grew from 220,000 in 1994, the first time employment grew in 10 years.\n\"I'd like to add here that I am very happy -- and proud -- that our transformation has created job growth,\" Gerstner said in his letter to shareholders, in which he described 1996 overall as \"a solid year.\"\nWhen Gerstner first took over the then-struggling computer giant in April 1993, one of his first actions was to take a whopping restructuring charge and cut 25,000 jobs from IBM.\nThe Global Services unit -- which designs, installs and services computers, including running entire corporate computer systems -- was formerly part of IBM's Sales and Services group.\nSales and Services will be renamed the Sales and Distribution Group, still headed by IBM Senior Vice President Ned Lautenbach.\nIBM also said Dennie Welsh, who was general manager of Global Services, will be promoted to a senior vice president and report directly to Gerstner.\nWelsh was also named an IBM group executive and will join IBM's executive committee, which makes strategic decisions.\n\"The time is right for this change,\" Gerstner said in an IBM memo announcing the reorganization. \"He (Welsh) and his colleagues on the services team have done an outstanding job building a great new business for IBM. This change not only reflects a logical adjustment in our organisational structure, but also a recognition of their success.\"\nIBM's services business has been its fastest growing in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter, IBM said services revenues jumped 22 percent to $5 billion. In comparison, IBM's total revenues grew 6 percent in the fourth quarter.\n\"This is a transformation of the IBM company,\" said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant. \"The major revenue stream is not coming from hardware, it will come from software and services ...\".\n\"This has some impact on the way IBM sees its future,\" Albert added. \"Anything this important demands direct oversight by Gerstner.\"\nWednesday's move follows changes in December when IBM consolidated computer services under the IBM Global Services brand. IBM's services organisation had been operating in some countries outside the United States under different names.\nThe addition of Global Services now gives IBM five major corporate divisions. The others are the Software Group, the Server Group, which makes the computers that run networks; the Personal Systems Group; and Sales and Distribution.\nWith Welsh's promotion to IBM senior vice president, the company now has a total of 10 senior vice presidents.\nIBM stock fell $1.50 to $137.857 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "The Federal Reserve may not be taking adequate precautions to ensure that its technological systems and those of the banks it regulates will function properly in the year 2000, Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato warned Monday.\nAfter querying U.S. bank regulators on the year 2000 computer issue in February, New York Republican D'Amato said he was troubled by the answers he received from the Fed and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).\nProblems are expected to crop up in computers and software that only record the last two digits of the year. Such a programme might treat the year 2000 as the year 1900, leading to serious miscalculations or even a system crash.\nD'Amato also queried in February the Office of the Comptroller, which oversees national banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Both entities told D'Amato they had detailed plans to cope with the so-called millennium bug.\nBut D'Amato singled out responses of the Fed and the NCUA as raising concerns over whether they are \"devoting enough attention and resources to solving the year 2000 crisis,\" D'Amato's office said in a release. D'Amato sent both agencies letters Monday asking for additional information.\n\"Congress expects detailed plans and concrete actions to prevent possible future catastrophes which could endanger the financial well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans,\" D'Amato said. \"We can't wait around, timing is critical.\"\nEstimates for fixing year 2000 problems in government and the private sector worldwide have ranged as high as $300 billion to $600 billion. Chase Manhattan Bank recently said in a routine filing it planned to spend $250 million on the problem over the next three years.\n\"We have no comment,\" Fed spokesman Joe Coyne said Monday. \"We will, of course, answer the letter.\"\nD'Amato said the Fed and the NCUA appeared to lack an aggressive plan of action for coping with the problem, failed to give an assessment about the scope of the problem in institutions they oversee, and did not explain how they would assist regulated institutions that might have a problem.\nThe Fed, which operates the nation's payment system moving $1 trillion a day among financial institutions, also failed to describe any steps it had taken to ensure that its own systems would be ready for the year 2000, D'Amato said.\n", "Beijing has pledged to open its doors to imports of U.S. textiles under a new deal, but Washington has no illusions it can close its yawning textile trade gap with China, diplomats said Monday.\nChinese and U.S. negotiators signed a new textile agreement in Beijing on Sunday in an 11th-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and ensured U.S. access to China's textile markets.\n\"It provides us with an opportunity to increase our access to China's markets in high-priority areas,\" one U.S. diplomat said. He declined to elaborate.\n\"(But) we are under no illusions that we are going to balance textiles as a single sector of our trade,\" said a second diplomat, who requested anonymity.\nChina exported $6.5 billion worth of textiles to the United States in 1995 but imported only $64 million worth. Diplomats attributed the sluggish U.S. textile exports to Beijing's high tariff rates and non-tariff barriers.\n\"Textiles are never going to be balanced but it's important that there be a market access element there,\" the second diplomat said.\nThe agreement gave China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact, and China pledged to reduce its tariffs on textile imports.\nBoth the Chinese and U.S. sides declined to say by how much U.S. textile exports to China would increase and vice versa, or by how much China's tariffs would be cut.\n\"There are significant gains for U.S. industries,\" a third diplomat said.\n\"It was, for the first time, a concessionary admission on (the) part of the Chinese that they too had to do something with regard to supplying market access for U.S. products where we were competitive,\" he said.\nThe overall U.S. trade deficit with China -- the United States' largest after its deficit with Japan -- was seen reaching $38 billion in 1996, up from $34 billion in 1995, according to U.S. figures.\nThe new textile agreement may be good news for U.S. textile manufacturers and exporters, but it could be bad news for China's lumbering state enterprises.\nA flood of U.S. textile imports could intensify competition and further cripple many of China's state enterprises, almost half of which are in the red, analysts said.\n\"U.S. textile imports will intensify competition in the already saturated domestic textile market,\" a Chinese economist said. \"Life will be even more difficult for a group of money-losing textile enterprises,\" said the economist, who asked not to be identified. \"Some enterprises will be forced to bow out of the textile industry -- declare bankruptcy or merge.\"\nState-owned textile factories in Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, registered losses of 350 million yuan ($42.2 million) in the first seven months of 1996, the China Business Times said Monday.\nThe accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade U.S. restrictions on Chinese imports.\nChina had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks. But it delayed the action to allow time for further talks.\nBeijing announced after Sunday's deal that it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but Washington's penalties remained in force.\n", "Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon will press Hong Kong leaders over the fate of Filipino workers who fear China might kick them out after it takes over the territory in July, diplomats said on Thursday.\nSiazon, who was to arrive in Hong Kong late on Thursday, will meet governor Chris Patten and future Hong Kong chief Tung Chee-hwa plus members of the 140,000 strong Filipino community, the largest expatriate group in the territory.\nSiazon, who will stay until Saturday, is expected to officially announce Manila's March 26 decision to waive visas for holder's of Hong Kong's post-colonial passport, an official at the Philippine consulate said.\nHong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, will become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on July 1.\nMost of the Philippine workers living in the territory are maids, whose presence helps fuel Hong Kong's vibrant economy by freeing up local mothers to work.\nBut with Hong Kong becoming part of China from July 1, many Filipinos fear they will replaced by an influx of domestic servants from mainland China.\n\"Mr Siazon might seek assurances from the government and especially from Tung that the Filipinas in Hong Kong will be allowed to continue to live and work in the territory after 1997 under the same conditions,\" said a source at Manila's consulate.\n\"He may also seek clarification on whether mainland helpers will be allowed to work in Hong Kong,\" the source said.\nCynthia Tellez, director of the Mission for Filipino Migrant Workers in Hong Kong, a key support group, said her community hoped Siazon could get clear assurances from the future Hong Kong government they can continue to work and live in Hong Kong.\n\"The last statement from China was that as long as we remain helpful to Hong Kong, the status quo will remain. But it's quite vague and nothing is written about it,\" she said.\n\"They feel concerned whether their positions would be taken by mainland women,\" she said, voicing fears that Hong Kong employers and future authorities, might prefer to allow more mainland Chinese women to work as maids.\nTellez also stressed that the Philippine government needed to address the wider concern of Filipinos working overseas.\n\"What is there when we go back home, will I have something to look forward to?\" she said.\nThe Hong Kong Filipino community are part of a diaspora of four million Filipinos, according to official data, working abroad to support families in their relatively poor country.\nTellez said the number of Filipinos working overseas was probably as high as seven million, when taking into account illegal workers.\nSpread over 137 countries the world over, the guest workers remit US$7 billion each year back to the Philippines.\n", "The big U.S. mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. pulled out of the now worthless Busang gold project on Monday as Canada's mining community reeled from the biggest fraud in mining history.\nThe Busang discovery  -- touted by Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd. as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale \"without precedent in the history of mining,\" according to a report issued late on Sunday by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd.\nNew Orleans-based Freeport said the report confirmed its own poor test results from the site.\n\"Consequently, (Freeport) will notify Bre-X that it is withdrawing from the Busang project pursuant to the terms of its contractual agreement,\" the company said in a statement.\nFor his part, Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh vowed investigators would \"get to the bottom\" of the scandal.\nStrathcona said it found evidence of tampering with Bre-X's core samples and that Strathcona's own tests discovered only trace amounts of gold at the Busang site where Bre-X claimed to have found 71 million ounces of gold.\nThe report said a gold deposit worth mining was unlikely to be found at the site.\n\"We are very disappointed that the apparent opportunity for (Freeport) to develop the Busang property has been eliminated by (our) findings ... as now confirmed by the Strathcona audit report,\" said Freeport Chief Executive Jim Bob Moffett.\nIn Jakarta, Nusamba Group -- an Indonesian company linked to President Suharto -- said it was withdrawing from the Busang project. Analysts said the scandal embarrassed the Indonesian government in the midst of an election campaign.\nBre-X has hired accounting firm Price Waterhouse, Forensic Investigative Associates and other advisers to find out how the data could have been falsified.\n\"Investigators will get to the bottom of this,\" Walsh told reporters before entering the company's headquarters in Calgary on Monday. He had no further comment.\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said investigators from its commercial crime unit are studying the Strathcona report.\n\"Bre-X has given us a copy of the report and our investigators are reviewing that (report),\" RCMP spokeswoman Deleen Schoff said in a telephone interview.\n\"I can't speculate on what they're going to do after they read the report,\" Schoff said.\nIn a separate statement, Bre-X's chief of exploration, John Felderhof, said he was shocked by the Strathcona report.\n\"I know that I was not involved in a fraud. I also find it very hard to believe that anyone on my staff was involved in a fraud,\" Felderhof said in a statement faxed from the Cayman Islands late on Sunday.\nRumors about Busang began to circulate in March when Michael de Guzman, Bre-X's chief geologist at the site, allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter on March 19 while en route to a meeting with Freeport officials in Indonesia.\nOn March 26, Freeport said that its preliminary tests found \"insignificant\" amounts of gold.\nAfter the Freeport announcement, Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona to review its Busang project.\nThe announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11).\nFreeport and Bre-X agreed to develop the Busang site in January after an intense bidding war by several big mining companies for control of the project.\nThe Bre-X fiasco has tarnished Canada's mining reputation at home and abroad. But Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said it should not be judged by the actions of one company.\n\"There might have been a bad situation in the case of Bre-X ... but the Canadian mining sector is considered the most capable and most competent in the world,\" Chretien said on Monday while campaigning during Canada's federal election.\nBre-X's stock was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday, but shares in other small Canadian miners tumbled as the Bre-X scandal reverberated through the mining community.\n\"I would say this year is largely a writeoff in terms of an overall junior resource bull market,\" said John Kaiser, editor of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report, a mining newsletter.\nMeanwhile, the mystery of what happened remained.\nThe reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Felderhof and his team of geologists, including de Guzman. The last estimate of 71 million ounces of gold was calculated by assay firm Kilborn SNC Lavalin, which has already said it was not responsible for sampling.\n\"I personally still believe that there are significant amounts of gold at Busang,\" Felderhof said in his statement.\nDisgruntled shareholders have launched at least eight class-action lawsuits against Bre-X and the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) said on Monday it would continue probing Bre-X for possible violations of trading and disclosure laws.\n", "Chrysler Corp. Tuesday announced $380 million in new investments for South America, including assembly plants for pickup trucks and diesel engines in Brazil and the expansion of a Jeep plant now being built in Argentina.\nChrysler, which is cautiously trying to rebuild its international presence, said the projects in Brazil were worth about $315 million, and the expansion in Argentina was worth about $65 million.\nRoughly one third of the total investment, or about $126.6 million, will come from Chrysler's suppliers, who will play a major role in the automaker's low-risk global growth strategy, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said.\n\"We don't intend to make risky investments just to be a major player in emerging markets,\" added Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president of international operations. \"We're quite content to grow at a steady pace in regions where we see solid opportunities.\"\nEaton said the investments will boost Chrysler's sales in the Mercosur free-trade zone, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.\nBut the company's limited production capacity will allow it only to grab a small portion of the Mercosur market away from rivals General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, he said.\n\"We are targeting very specific market segments,\" he said. \"We don't have any interest or desire to offer a vehicle for every possible application.\"\nThe new Brazilian plant, which will be Chrysler's third limited-production facility in South America, will assemble the automaker's all-new Dakota compact pickup truck for sale in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the countries in the Mercosur free-trade zone.\nIn Argentina, Chrysler said it will add production of about 6,000 Jeep Cherokees a year at a plant now under construction in the Cordoba province. The plant is already scheduled to build about 14,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees per year starting next April, and Cherokee output will begin in 1998.\nA site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll off the assembly line starting in mid-1998, Chrysler said. Production, however, will be modest, with 12,000 trucks in the first year and an ultimate capacity of 40,000 units annually. Employment will start at 400 people.\nThe trucks at first will be largely assembled from \"complete knock-down\" kits shipped from the United States, but the automaker intends to meet the Mercosur trade bloc's 60 percent local content requirement after three years.\nChrysler has not decided whether to market the Dakota under the Dodge brand name or under one of its other brands. The automaker now uses the only Jeep and Chrysler brand names outside the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nThe $315 million Brazil investment also includes a new diesel engine plant to be built by Detroit Diesel Corp..\nThe $10 million facility will supply the company's Italian-designed VM Motori four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines for use in the Brazilian Dakota as well as in Jeep models built in Argentina. Chrysler installs about 40,000 of the engines annually into minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold in Europe.\nOthers suppliers supporting the Chrysler by opening plants in Latin America include Dana Corp., Johnson Controls Inc., Lear Corp., Lear Corp. United Technologies Corp. and PPG Industries Inc., Chrysler executives said.\nEaton said total annual vehicle sales in the four-country Mercosur region will increase from about 2 million units currently to about 2.5 million by the end of the decade.\n\"We think this is a major growth area,\" Eaton said. \"It's politically and economically a stable region, we think with particularly rising consumer buying power.\"\nIncluding a small plant in Venezuela that assembles Cherokees and Neon small cars from kits, the investments announced Tuesday bring to $735 million the total financial commitments Chrysler and its suppliers have made in South America, the company said.\nChrysler stock rose 25 cents to close at $28.875 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.\n", "A court in southwest China sentenced at least five dissidents to prison terms of up to 10 years for subversion, a human rights watchdog group said on Saturday.\nAt least eight other dissidents were rounded up in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou province, in the same case, the New York-based Human Rights in China said.\nAn unknown number of the eight were sentenced, the group said. Details were not available.\nThe Guiyang Intermediate People's Court sentenced the five dissidents in May, 1996, but Human Rights in China said it was not able to confirm their convictions until recently.\n\"There were many people involved. The place was remote...It took a lot of time to verify the facts,\" Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China, told Reuters by telephone.\nThe convictions could not be indepenently confirmed. Court officials and police could not be reached for comment.\nTwo of the political activists, Lu Yongxiang and Huang Zhongmin, were arrested in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1995 -- the sixth anniversary of a bloody military crackdown on student-led demonstrations for democracy -- while distributing copies of a daring, open letter to Communist Party leaders, the group said.\nLu, 50, a veteran dissident, and Huang, 35, a businessman, were each sentenced to five years in prison for participating in a counter-revolutionary group, spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.\nChen Xi, 42, a lecturer-turned-businessman, received the harshest sentence -- 10 years in prison -- for organising and leading a counter-revolutionary group.\nThe open letter demanded the ruling Communist Party lift a decades-old ban on the establishment of new political parties and newspapers and draft a new constitution guaranteeing independence of the judiciary, democratic elections and freedom of the press.\nIn the letter, the dissidents threw their weight behind Zhao Ziyang, who was deposed as Communist Party chief in a power struggle that followed the 1989 crackdown.\nZhao is under virtual house arrest, sources close to him have said. He dropped from public view after May 19, 1989, when he visited students occupying Tiananmen Square and, with tears in his eyes, beseeched their leaders to end the protests. The next day hardliners clamped martial law on the Chinese capital.\nOn June 3 and 4, 1989 troops backed by tanks and firing automatic weapons stormed into the city, retaking the square and crushing the demonstrations with heavy loss of life.\nThe open letter also demanded the authorities release fellow dissidents, including former student leader Wang Dan, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last year for conspiring to subvert the government.\nThe two other dissidents jailed by the Guiyang court were Liao Shuangyuan, 43, a legal adviser, and Zeng Ning, 28, a legal expert, who received four and two years in prison respectively for organising and joining a counter-revolutionary group.\nChina jailed dozens of dissidents in 1996 as part of a drive for stability that followed an easing of foreign pressure over its human rights record, diplomats and human rights activists say.\nBeijing regularly hits out at criticism of its human rights record, regarding it as interference in its internal affairs and saying its priority is to fulfill the rights of its 1.2 billion people to food and clothing.\n", "The French government is moving edgily towards a key decision for the future of Europe's defence industry -- whether to privatise defence electronics group Thomson-CSF through a public sale or private placement.\nThe stakes are huge, as the choice of the method of sale will to a large extent determine the final outcome of a far-reaching restructuring in the French defence industry and has major implications for the entire sector in Europe.\nLike a master chess player, the state must look several moves ahead, decide what sort of defence industry it wants to see in a few years' time, and ensure the decision will be seen as fair to all involved.\nGovernment sources said on Friday that the decision, originally expected at the end of January, would probably slip into early February because the government was studying in great detail all the elements of the politically-sensitive dossier that involves Europe's biggest defence electronics company.\n\"The decision will be taken shortly, but not today. We are still studying all possibilities,\" said an official source.\n\"The decision will have to be taken by the cabinet. At the moment there is no proposal to send to the ministers. I could not tell you when exactly that will happen,\" he added.\nPrime Minister Alain Juppe is anxious to avoid another embarassment like the one he suffered on December 4 when the government had to suspend an earlier privatisation plan under which Thomson-CSF would have gone to conglomerate French Lagardere Groupe.\nThat deal involved the privatisation of the Thomson group, which included both a 68 percent stake in Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).\nThe state was forced to call off the plan because the independent privatisation commission balked at the terms of a sale of TMM to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.\nThe cancellation outraged the Korean, who called the decision racist and prompted an angry call for explanation from President Kim Young-sam.\nSince then the French government has decided to separate the sales of TMM and Thomson-CSF.\nThe ultimate aim of the government is to have a strong defence industry able to supply its armed forces with state-of-the art weaponry and play a leading role in Europe and on the world scene.\nA year ago, President Jacques Chirac announced a wide-ranging restructuring of the French defence industry around a merged group of Aerospatialeand Dassault Aviation for aerospace, and Thomson-CSF for electronics.\nWith a public sale through a market float, Thomson-CSF management will have its hands free to pursue its own negotiations about future alliances while interested partners can acquire stakes on the market.\nBut this may mean that a foreign cash-rich group from elsewhere in Europe or from the U.S. or Asia could buy itself into the talks.\nWith a private placement there are two main options.\nOne is by choosing candidates for a sale using a \"cahier de charges\" -- a sort of bidding book comprising price, intended strategy and commitments on jobs and investments.\nThis would leave the government with the biggest influence on the outcome, but also with the biggest responsibilty.\nAnother procedure, rare in France, would be to auction the state's 68-percent stake in Thomson-CSF among qualified bidders, putting the emphasis on price and ensuring the greatest possible revenues for the state at a time France is trying to reduce its public deficits ahead of monetary union.\n", "The plight of English soccer team Millwall provides a cautionary tale for investors planning to buy into the growing number of clubs joining the stock market, share analysts said on Wednesday.\nMillwall's financial crisis was likely to make potential investors more careful about which stocks they pick in what is a much-hyped and increasingly crowded sector, analysts said.\nMillwall Holdings Plc, owners of the London second division club, have called in administrators to run the company while it seeks to put together a financial rescue package.\nShares in Millwall remain suspended on the London Stock Exchange.

It may be the end of Regan's offer but that's not the same thing. Regan's done a lot of other people's work for them,\" commented one banking source.\nIn favour of its hopes of staying independent, CWS boasts a convoluted ownership and voting structure which complicates any hostile takeover attempt.\nBut Regan, who had planned to mount a bid approach through a unit of his Lanica Trust Plc, has identified both a wealth of underperforming assets and possible purchasers in the event of any break-up, and put in place the financing to back it.\nIt was not the deal that ultimately foundered, but doubts about Regan himself that allowed CWS to claim victory in what may prove to be only round one of its fight for independence.\nLast week, the group turned in a 10 million pound ($16.2 million) fall in profits for the year before tax and distribution to its members of 68.2 million pounds on flat sales of around three billion pounds.\nA 21 percent rise in trading profits in its banking arm was more than offset by falls in its trading operations.\nRegan planned a 1.2 billion pound offer for CWS through a company specially set up for the purpose - Galileo Group - intending to sell off CWS businesses which include supermarkets, banking, insurance as well as opticians, chemists and funeral parlours.\nAllied Irish Banks confirmed it was among those interested in Co-op businesses, and supermarket chain J.Sainsbury was also reported to be among those lining up to purchase the assets.\nThe plans foundered amid allegations of financial irregularities regarding an earlier deal Regan had been involved in concerning a food supply agreement with the CWS and Hobson Plc, which was run by Regan at that time.\nCWS has launched criminal proceedings against Regan, partner David Lyons and suspended CWS employee Allan Green relating to confidential documents allegedly stolen by Green.\nIt is also suing Regan's banking advisor Hambros and law firm Travers Smith Braithwaite.\nAccording to banking sources, Regan's decision to ditch his bid may have been precipitated by the threat that his financial backers were about to pull out.\nJapanese bank Nomura which was financing it was understood to be very unhappy about the allegations surrounding Regan and had written to Hambros on Wednesday demanding a full explanation of them by nine o'clock Thursday morning.\nBut Nomura had not been satisfied by the response it had received according to the industry sources and was reviewing its position when Regan announced he was dropping his bid.\nA spokesman for Nomura declined to comment.

FCC officials said bidding among the 23 companies -- including units of BellSouth Corp., Comcast Corp. and a Bell Atlantic Corp./Nynex Corp. joint venture -- appears to be winding down.\nAnalysts argued that the low total underscores the point that spectrum sales will probably not be the \"golden goose\" that lawmakers and the Clinton administration have looked to for eliminating the budget deficit.\n\"It's nice to think of it as government property that would earn the country some money,\" said analyst David Roddy of Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting Group. \"But the sale of the spectrum was too much and too fast.\"\nSaid Elliott Hamilton, an analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm: \"It's not an endless supply of gold out there at the end of the rainbow.\"\n\"Congress, the White House and the FCC have to sit down and start rationalising their approach to spectrum.\"\nThe \"wireless communications services\" or WCS auction is the FCC's 14th airwaves sale. Potential applications for the spectrum include broadband wireless access to the Internet, wireless local phone networks, and location services for pinpointing trucks and other vehicles.\nThe auctions have netted the government about $23 billion, far more than expected. But prices have begun to slide as more spectrum is sold, contributing to financial problems among wireless carriers and raising doubts over whether Uncle Sam ever will collect all the money it is owed.\nLooking ahead, the Clinton administration proposed in its 1998 budget to raise $36.1 billion by selling licenses to firms wanting to sell new ways to link to the Internet or send video images through the air, among other possible services.\n\"They're not going to make that,\" predicted Roddy of Deloitte &amp; Touche.\nIndeed, the WCS sale offered a new twist. In its zeal to balance the budget, Congress last year required the FCC to hold the auction by April 15 and to collect the proceeds by Sept. 30, the last day of the 1997 fiscal year.\nFCC officials said the timetable has contributed to the meagre returns. Potential bidders, communications-equipment manufacturers and wireless investors were not given enough time to fully analyse the auction, they said.\n\"This is exactly why we told Congress we should always have at least a year's advance notice,\" said Hundt, adding that his agency was given less than five months.\nSome on Capitol Hill are eyeing the problem.\nSen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who heads the commerce committee, plans to offer a bill soon to try and maximize the money the government raises in auctions.\nTo prevent spectrum from being dumped on the market, the bill would allow for a \"reasonable time lag\" between the allocation of the spectrum and its sale by the FCC.\nThe nation's broadcasters, in the transition to digital television, are using recent auction woes as evidence that they should not have to hand back their analogue TV licenses by the year 2006. The permits would be auctioned for other uses.\n\"Such proposals will undermine our ability to meet the challenges of moving our nation into the digital future, and will simply not be achievable on the revenue side,\" the National Association of Broadcasters told lawmakers.\nHundt disagrees. \"Everyone who has spectrum wants to make sure that no one else ever gets any.\"\n", "China plans \"education\" sessions among its restive Moslem Uighur minority after an anti-Chinese riot in the northwestern Xinjiang region left nine people dead and nearly 200 wounded, officials said on Thursday.\nOfficials would launch an education campaign throughout the region to teach Xinjiang's Uighurs about the importance of patriotism and to persuade them not to take part in such unrest in future.\n\"We are preparing a circular to distribute throughout Xinjiang on this incident,\" Zhang Yuliang, director of the propaganda department of the Xinjiang regional Communist Party committee, told Reuters by telephone from the regional capital, Urumqi.\n\"We will carry out a session of education for the masses to teach them about ethnic unity,\" he said.\nAuthorities have issued emergency circulars calling on local officials to deal a blow to separatism in the frontier region.\nPolice in Yining near China's border with Kazakhstan were interrogating the suspected ringleaders of the two-day riot against Chinese rule that rocked the town last week, officials said by telephone.\nOne Yining government official said authorities had revised the toll from the riot, saying nine people had been killed, including four policemen.

In Sakhalin-I, due to begin output right after the turn of the century, one Rosneft unit has a 17 percent interest while a second affiliate has 23 percent.\nRosneft also has a 7.5 percent stake in the $2 billion Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which will build a new oil export pipeline from Kazakhstan to Russia, and a 20 percent stake in the $20 billion international Timan-Pechora Company project.\n\"This is more than just a corporate battle,\" said one of the Russian sources. \"Rosneft is going to start reeking of money very soon, and Sibneft's owner senses this.\"\nRosneft's privileged position could introduce a new variable into the tortuous negotiations foreign energy firms go through to try to get oil deals in Russia off the ground.\nA senior Western energy executive said Rosneft's status as representative of the government in output-sharing deals was unclear and he was unsure of its effect on stalled projects.\nOne of the Russian sources said Rosneft had once been in preliminary talks with Exxon Corp, Amoco Corp and Total of France on possible strategic alliances but that talks could not proceed until Rosneft's fate was decided.\n\"For the (international) majors, Rosneft is not a hypothetical partner now,\" the source said.\nBerezovsky, through Rosneft's new, government-appointed president, Yuri Bespalov, has undertaken a sweeping overhaul of Rosneft managers, replacing half a dozen powerful department heads, including Valentin Zlatov, who oversaw exports. Rosneft vice-presidents and deputy chairmen are no longer empowered to conduct negotiations with foreign partners or to sign contracts.\nSources said Sibneft, whose main production unit is Noyabrskneftegaz, was positioning, possibly through an unknown affiliate, to place a winning bid for Rosneft in a forthcoming auction of the company's shares.\n\"I keep hearing from many Russians that Berezovsky is definitely going for Rosneft,\" said the Western oil executive. \"There is a sense now that it's much more certain.\"\nMoscow has held sales of prize stakes in privatised oil companies but nearly all of them have been won by what appear to be pre-determined winners allied with the company being sold.\nThe original privatisation plan for Rosneft, Russia's 10th largest producer with 1996 output of 262,000 barrels per day, calls for 47 percent to be auctioned off. The state would retain 51 percent while workers would get two percent.\nRosneft, which Moscow once envisioned as Russia's national oil company, has wanted to emulate the success of its private competitors, like LUKoil. Senior Rosneft officials once begged to be described as a private oil company, even though it is still 100 percent state-owned.\n", "Investment bank Natwest Markets Australia Ltd said on Tuesday it aimed to hold on to its leading market share in equities broking in Australia in 1997 but would stay clear of the burgeoning mortgage securitisation sector.\n\"The first thing is to make sure we maintain our market position,\" Natwest Markets Australia Ltd chief executive Peter St George told Reuters in an interview. \"We want to broaden and deepen our penetration of the market,\" St George said.  \nNatwest Markets currently leads the rankings of equities brokers in Australia as measured by the latest Australian Stock Exchange data with a 9.8 percent market share.\nSt George said Natwest would need to widen its research and distribution activities to keep up with the likely changes in the Australian stock market over the next two to three years.\nThe impending privatisation of Australia's largest telecoms group, Telstra Corp, as well as the sale of government-owned airports and the demutualisation of Australia's largest insurance and investment group, The Australian Mutual Provident Society, would change the shape of the market overall, he said.  \n\"If you look on a two to three year horizon you should see big movements in the market in telecoms, infrastructure and insurance,\" St George said.\n\"These are some changes for people to get their research capabilities and international delivery mechanisms in place for,\" he said.\nEarlier on Tuesday Natwest Markets Australia, a unit of National Westminister Bank Plc, reported a 40 percent rise in operating profit before tax to A$70.5 million for calendar 1996.  \n\"The areas we will focus on in terms of the equities business are advancing some of the work we've been doing in the structured products and derivatives products,\" St George said.\nNatwest's debt and corporate finance divisions would aim to extend non-government debt operations but would stay away from the structuring of securitised mortgage deals for now, he said.\n\"In the debt markets, we're getting away from some of the meatier bonds like government bonds and looking into some of the other areas, like corporate bonds and infrastructure financing,\" he said.  \nSt George said Natwest Markets was involved on a large scale in the mortgage securitisation market in the United States and elsewhere but would concentrate on the wholesale sector in Australia.\n\"It's quite labour intensive.

But economic analysts say the government has spent at least half that on a February public-sector pay rise.\nState workers staged a seven-day strike and won increases well above the weighted 13.5 percent first offered by Ocampo.  \nPrivate-sector industrialists bridled at the emergency program, claiming that such measures were usually only applied in the case of natural disasters. They argued that the tax on foreign loans would drive up import prices and feul inflation.\nAfter Wednesday's court ruling, Luis Carlos Villegas, head of the influential National Industrialists' Association, said: \"This ruling fills us full of confidence because it will indicate to the government what measures it can reasonably use and what it cannot do.\"\nIn announcing the ruling, Vladimiro Naranjo, a Constitutional Court judge, said the decision was based on the perception that the economic problems were not the result of abrupt and unforeseen circumstances -- the requirement needed to declare an emergency.\n\"This decision gives us great satisfaction.

Communist Party to tighten control over the nation's armed forces, saying new defence legislation was essential to bring law to the military.\nMembers of the standing committee of the National People's Congress had agreed to submit a draft defence law for approval by a full parliamentary session, the Xinhua news agency said.\n\"It must be made clear in the law that absolute party leadership over the military must be strengthened,' to ensure a correct political path for the People's Liberation Army (PLA),\" the official agency quoted leading committee members as saying.\nThe three-million-strong PLA has for decades been considered the \"gun\" of the Communist Party (CCP), but analysts say leaders are keen to buttress their control in the face of concerns over the army's loyalty and its growing financial independence.\nBeijing has tried to rein in the PLA's vast business empire and to strengthen the network of communist cadres charged with overseeing political education and policy among military ranks.\nThe 13-chapter defence law, which began to be drafted in September 1993, has reportedly been long delayed by high-level disagreement over the extent to which it should formalise the Party's leadership role.\nThe law is also expected formally to empower the military to crush rebellions and struggles for regional independence -- roles the army has already shouldered in the past.\n\"Most lawmakers expressed the view that formulation of the national defence law is crucial for the rule of law in the military field,\" Xinhua said.\nForeign analysts of the Chinese military say some army loyalties have been weakened by conflicting institutional interests, business activities and growing corruption.\nEfforts to boost military loyalty by current party leaders -- few of whom enjoy the military credibility of their revolutionary forebears -- had been unrelenting since 1989, wrote analyst and scholar David Shambaugh earlier this year.\n\"No doubt the Party's efforts to ensure control over and gain the 'absolute loyalty' of the armed forces arise not only from the CCP leadership's own insecurities but also from the military's growing autonomy,\" Shambaugh wrote.\nConcerns over the influence of the military's business activities were echoed by legislators reviewing the draft law.\nThe PLA should be banned from business for profit and military expenditure should be guaranteed by the government to make the armed forces concentrate on protecting state security, Xinhua quoted lawmaker Huang Yuzhang as saying.\nHuang had also called for a commitment by China not to threaten the security of other nations to be added to the law to illustrate Beijing's policy of \"active defence\", it said.\nConcerns that growing military power could herald future expansionism have risen among China's regional neighbours in recent years, as Beijing has moved to upgrade military technology and boost its power at sea and in the air.\nChina, which has in past decades fought fierce wars across several of its borders, says such fears are entirely unfounded.\nThe state should provide sufficient funds for the research and

But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal.\n\"Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we're in today? Or is there really going to be improvement this time?\" asked Representative John Duncan, a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee.\nValentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the \"final assembly.\"\nValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May, killing 110 people, because of a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners.\nThe head of the NTSB disclosed this week, however, that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident.\nNTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident. Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24.\n\"It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week. You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place, that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States,\" Hall said.\nAn FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB.\n", "Talks between Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workers will resume with the help of a federal mediator, the parties said Friday, almost a year and a half after striking workers returned to the work at the heavy machinery maker.\nNo date has been set for the talks called by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The talks would be the first formal negotiations since November 1995, when a tentative agreement, subsequently rejected, was submitted to UAW members.\nThe 17-month strike ended in December 1995 without a new contract. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar's workers have been without a contract since 1991.\nNeither Caterpillar nor the union would say if any specific event occurred to spur new talks.\n\"As a result of conversations between FMCS, UAW and Caterpillar, I have called a meeting of the parties for a discussion of the issues between them,\" John Calhoun Wells, FMCS director, said in a statement.\nA union official said jobs and job security have been main issues throughout negotiations, while almost 400 unfair labour practice complaints by the UAW and seniority problems have also become issues.\n\"I've always felt that there's going to come a time when it would make a good business decision for the company\" to reach a labour agreement, Jim Clingan, executive vice president of UAW local 974 in Peoria, said. But he added that he did not know if that time has been reached.\nCaterpillar has reported record profits in the wake of the strike and analysts have said the continuing labour woes have had little, if any, impact on the company's bottom line.\n\"(Caterpillar is) not going to budge enough for it to make a difference,\" said J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. \"Even if they get a contract, it's not going to look very different than what those guys are working under now.\"\nCaterpillar reported profit of $1.4 billion on revenues of $16.52 billion in 1996.\nIn a statement, Cateprillar vice president Wayne Zimmerman called the resumption of meetings \"a positive development.\"\n\"It's long past time to resolve the uncertainty this dispute has created for our employees,\" Zimmerman said.\nUAW president Stephen Yokich also welcomed Wells' announcement.\n\"It is clearly in the best interests of all stakeholders, including communities and families, that the long-standing labour dispute be resolved equitably,\" Yockich said in a statement.\nCaterpillar shares rose $2.625 to $93.375 in line with other capital equipment makers.\nBrumley noted that when the news of the announcement was made, Caterpillar shares traded lower briefly.\n", "Computer Associates International Inc shares gave up six percent of their value Wednesday and analysts said the fall reflected concern over an unexpected secular decline in mainframe revenues.\nWhile the company had issued cautionary comments in late December that revenues were unlikely to meet expecations due to sales problems in its European operations, analysts said they were caught off guard by the mainframe sales slippage.\nBy midday Wednesday, the stock had fallen three points to 43.  It was the second most active issue on the NYSE.  \nIn addition, analysts said CA's decline may be tied to broader weakness in the mainframe business, citing disappointing growth in International Business Machines Corp's own hardware business during the December quarter.\nIBM is the world's dominant supplier of mainframe software, while Computer Associates is a leading independent supplier of software used to run mainframe machines.\n\"People got spooked about the mainframe business,\" said Alex. Brown analyst Chris Mortenson, who noted the company told analysts in a conference call Tuesday night mainframe revenues had fallen eight percent in the December quarter.  \nCowen &amp; Co analyst Drew Brosseau said mainframe sales were a primary reason why he had lowered his revenue estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter ending in March and for its fiscal 1998 year.  He also tied the stock decline back to IBM.\n\"Anything that affects IBM mainframes positively or negatively is going to have an impact on CA,\" he said, noting how IBM's mainframe growth is considered a key indicator of the health of the mainframe business overall.\nThe analyst said he trimmmed his March fourth quarter revenue estimate by $40 million to $1.6 billion and reduced fiscal 1998 revenues by $150 million to $4.55 billion.  \nBut despite mounting mainframe revenue concerns, most analysts left earnings estimates and stock ratings untouched.\n\"Most of that near-term transitional challenge is in the stock so we are still recommending it,\" Brosseau said. \"But I expect the performance to come mostly in the second half of the (calendar) year.\" He stood by his $55 12-month target.\nMortensen added that, \"I find today that most investors are asking, 'What's going to make the stock go up in the next 30 days?' If you don't have a good answer, they sell it.\"\nThe stock has fallen back in recent weeks from the historic high of just under 68 it acheived in early December.  \nAlthough the company said in October that it was planning to focus its business increasingly on client/server instead of mainframe software, and warned in December of a transitional revenue shortfall, analysts said they were suprised to see an absolute decline in mainframe sales during the latest quarter.\nIn a published note, Furman Selz analyst Sanjiv Hingorani said mainframe revenues fell eight percent to $640 million, mostly in Europe.  He said CA had suggested the shortfall in the region amounted to $200 million in unrealized revenues.\nEspecially troubling to analysts was a sequential decline in mainframe MIPS among existing customers CA had described.  \nMIPS, or Millions of Instructions Per Second, is a measure of the capacity of the mainframe systems shipped to customers.\nIn its own commments to analysts Tuesday evening, IBM said MIPS grew 35 percent in the fourth quarter compared with 80 percent in fourth quarter 1995.  MIPS are the primary indicator of mainframe growth IBM discloses to analysts.\nMortenson said Computer Associates executives said they had never encountered such a decline in mainframe capacity. Under grilling by analysts, they said they believed it to be an anomaly which would disappear in the current quarter.\nThe company, which has historically derived more than 70 percent of its revenues from mainframe sales, said mainframe software accounted for 61 percent of revenues in the December quarter, while client/server software amounted to 39 percent.\nComputer Associates reported operating earnings of $0.75 per share for its fiscal third quarter ended in December versus $0.60 per share in the December 1995 quarter. The latest quarter excluded a $598 million acquisition charge.\n((-- New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736))\n", "Britain and China moved ahead on Wednesday to resolve outstanding details of Beijing's recovery of sovereignty over Hong Kong this year.\nJust a day after they had agreed on a budget to straddle the handover, the two sides announced a breakthrough allowing Hong Kong a free hand to organise media coverage of the historic event on June 30 without China's interference.\nAnd Britain's chief diplomatic negotiator said he thought there would soon be an agreement on one of the last burning issues -- the right of abode in the territory.\nThe latest progress comes just four months before Britain ends a century and a half of colonial rule and hands the territory of 6.4 million people back to communist-ruled China.\nBut a possible political bombshell lurked in the background as a prominent pro-democracy legislator prepared to ask the government to press China on the role of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong after the change of flag.\nOn the media accord in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), Britain's negotiator Hugh Davies said: \"We very much look forward to as many as possible of the international press, the local press being interested in participating and recording and reporting on the handover ceremony.\"\nHuman rights and democracy activists had voiced fears that China would not consent to a media invasion without the right to vet which journalists come to the event.\n\"The two sides have agreed to entrust the Hong Kong government to receive and process applications from journalists, as well as handle and arrange other matters relating to media coverage of the handover ceremony,\" the two sides said.\n\"There will be no criteria applied...provided you don't turn out to be a terrorist,\" Davies told reporters.\nIt was the second positive turn in the JLG talks in as many days. On Tuesday Britain and China struck a deal on Hong Kong's 1997/98 fiscal year, starting April 1 and covering the handover year. Finance Secretary Donald Tsang will read the budget to the legislature on March 12.\n\"We are convinced it will be welcomed by society,\" said Chinese representative Chen Zuo'er, adding that the budget would stick to Hong Kong's \"prudent and moderate\" tradition.\nDavies said after that deal that he was hopeful a deal could soon be done on right of abode, covering who would have residence rights in Hong Kong and on what terms.\n\"I hope major progress can be made on those matters which are not yet resolved,\" his Chinese counterpart Zhao Juhua said. The two sides also still have to work out an agreement on details of the People's Liberation Army garrison that China plans to install in Hong Kong, as well as a guest list for the handover ceremony, and a string of air services agreements.\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong's post-colonial leader-to-be Tung Chee-hwa saw his fortunes climb in the opinion polls as the latest survey showed more than three quarters of people felt confident he would do a good job as Hong Kong's Chief Executive.\nBut Tung remained under pressure from Hong Kong critics and foreign governments concerned about his support for Beijing's plan to roll back democratic freedoms in the territory.\nThe United States, European parliament members, as well as newsaper editorial writer, have urged Tung and China this week to realise that political and economic freedoms go hand in hand, and that a cut in basic rights could hurt the economy.\nA group called the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature, on Wednesday condemned the opening of a liaison office for the shadow legislature that China plans to install on July 1, dissolving the present elected Legislative Council. It urged the Hong Kong government to seek a court injunction against the move.\n", "Computer Associates International Inc said on Tuesday at its North American revenues grew 33 percent in its December quarter, cushioning the blow of a pre-announced decline in European sales.\nIn a phone interview, Sanjay Kumar, CA's president and chief operating officer, said European revenues declined about 20 percent year-on-year.\nTotal revenues for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31 were $1.05 billion against $1.00 billion in the December quarter of 1995.\nAlso, the executive said CA had become a \"big buyer\" of its own stock since the company's warning in late December of a revenue shortfall sent the stock price tumbling.\nCA stock had been trading around record high levels of $67 and now is in the mid $40's.\nKumar said the revenue problem arose from the software maker's on-going transition to a client-server focus from its traditional mainframe base.\nHe said the mainframe-oriented European sales force was finding the switch to highly competitive open systems software a challenge.  \nKumar said he told Wall Street analysts in a conference call Tuesday evening that it could take a quarter and perhaps two quarters to put its European sales back on track.\n\"We clearly need the current quarter to work through these issues,\" he said, referring to the fiscal fourth quarter ending in March.\n\"My thinking at this point is that (I would like to have) the room if needed into the first quarter,\" he said.\n\"I told analysts that I am not doing anything short term just to grab some revenue,\" he added.  \nThe CA executive said Italy and Spain continue to do well but France and Germany suffered the brunt of the sales downturn.\nAsia/Pacific revenue growth was \"very strong\" with China growing 100 percent year over year.\nKumar said client/server revenues now account for 39 percent of CA's total with mainframe revenues making up the rest. Client/server revenues grew 43 percent year on year, he noted. \"I would clearly like to see us cross the 50-50 line in 1997, but it may take until 1998,\" he said, referring to the split between mainframe and client/server revenues.\nIn its third quarter earnings results, CA reported operating earnings of $0.75 a share, 25 percent above the December 1995 quarter's $0.60.\nThat excluded a pre-announced charge of $598 million for the acquisition of Cheyenne Software.\n", "A monster shakeup of Canada's biggest city, Toronto, has sparked a citizens' revolt against Ontario's ruling Conservatives and raised eyebrows among those who do business in the country's financial capital.\nThis clean, peaceful city -- sometimes dubbed \"New York run by the Swiss\" -- has recently become a battleground in the so-called \"Common Sense Revolution\" initiated by Ontario's Conservative Premier Mike Harris.\nPromising leaner, cheaper government, Harris wants to merge Toronto and six neighbouring municipalities into a single \"megacity\" of 2.4 million people. The new city would hold about 8 percent of Canada's 30 million people and dwarf all but three of Canada's 10 provinces.\nHarris also plans a fundamental shift in how public services -- everything from education to welfare -- are delivered and paid for.\nOpponents fear the municipal reform blitz will drive up taxes and lead to the kind of urban decay witnessed in many cities in the United States, just across the border.\nThe threat of such wrenching change being rammed through without a binding plebiscite has outraged citizens and prompted accusations of tyranny and fascism.\n\"Government is not elected for the politicians. It is elected by the people for the people,\" Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall told a crowd after residents in the seven affected areas voted three to one against a merger in a referendum earlier this month. The vote was not binding on Ontario's government, which has vowed to press ahead with its plan.\nThe referendum capped a campaign that saw an Ontario cabinet minister likened to Adolf Hitler, bomb threats against a polling firm, and thousands of protesters marching in the streets in a re-enactment of a civic rebellion in 1837.\nHarris has held firm. \"I don't think we can withdraw the need for change,\" he said, adding that there may be amendments when the legislation is introduced.\nThe \"megacity\" revolt has grabbed headlines across the country and overseas, even prompting some foreign consulates to keep a wary eye on the political wrangling.\n\"There is some interest, but it's purely because it has appeared in the (British) papers,\" said Terry Curran, the British Consul in Toronto.\nMeanwhile, high-profile Canadian business leaders, politicians and artists have joined to oppose the merger plan.\nThey include film director Norman Jewison, Molson Cos. Ltd Chief Executive Norman Seagram, and writer Margaret Atwood who compared the megacity's architects to the Three Stooges.\nThe \"No\" side captured 75 percent of the votes in the referendum, but the process was flawed and turnout was low.\nUnder draft legislation, known as Bill 103, the seven city halls and 106 politicians who now govern the Greater Toronto Area will shrink to one elected mayor and 44 councillors.\nThe government also plans to overhaul property taxes, eliminate more than half of the province's school boards, seize control of education funding and download a bigger share of social programme costs onto the municipalities.\nHarris has said the reforms are revenue neutral, but critics say municipalities may be forced to raise taxes.\nThey fear welfare rolls could soar and one of the hardest hit communities would be Toronto, which has a heavier welfare caseload and nearly half of the province's social housing.\n\"You're doing something that is very volatile and on a tax base which has very little flexibility,\" said George Fierheller, president of Toronto's Board of Trade.\nMore than 75 percent of the board's members favour reducing the size of government through a merger but nearly half worry about dumping such heavy responsibilities onto municipalities.\n\"As a Torontonian and a businessman responsible for a large company, I'm wary of abrupt change without making sure you've thought it through,\" said Peter Godsoe, chairman of Canada's fourth-largest bank, Bank of Nova Scotia.\nThe influential debt rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, has warned \"the very nature and scale of the reforms...create new challenges that could affect the credit quality of some municipalities.\"\nThe downloading trend has been a feature of government at all levels in Canada as they struggle with budget deficits.\nOntario is in a tougher bind than most. Faced with a huge C$10 ($7.38) billion deficit when they came to power in 1995, the Conservatives slashed spending and cut the deficit to C$7.7 billion in 1996/97, while easing some taxes.\nThe Harris revolution has kept the government high in opinion polls, but public support has slipped recently, with backing for the Conservatives down to 37 percent in Metro Toronto, compared with 41 percent for the opposition Liberals.\n", "Chrysler Corp. said Monday it has developed a new way to extract hydrogen from gasoline that could shave 10 years off the introduction of super-efficient electric cars powered by \"fuel cells.\"\nLong used in spacecraft applications, fuel cells generate electricity through the chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, triggered by a platinum catalyst.\nDetroit automotive engineers have studied them as a potential power source, but have scratched their heads at the problems associated with producing, distributing and storing highly volatile hydrogen fuel.\nAt the North American International Auto Show here, Chrysler said Monday it has developed a fuel cell system that can extract hydrogen from normal gasoline and power a future car with a 50 percent increase in fuel efficiency over current cars using conventional internal combustion engines.\n\"We believe hydrogen needs to be processed from gasoline on-board vehicles because hydrogen isn't a practical fuel choice today,\" said Francois Castaing, Chrysler's vice president of vehicle engineering. \"Simply put, there's not any filling stations supplying it to a mass market.\"\nIf the system ever makes it out of the laboratory, drivers of gasoline fuel cell cars would simply refuel at a normal gasoline station, although the car would have a smaller tank than those used today.\nBut the elaborate system -- called an on-board \"refinery\" by Chrysler advanced technologies specialist Christopher Borroni-Bird -- faces significant hurdles. Packed with precious metal catalysts to remove harmful sulphur and carbon monoxide emissions, it would cost 10 times more than a conventional internal combustion engine, or about $30,000.\nChrysler hopes to have a working test vehicle within three years, and estimates that if the rest of the auto industry adopts the same approach to fuel cells, they could become commercially viable power sources by 2010 to 2015.\n\"In time, we think development of this processor will help open the door to the use of fuel cells as the primary power source in a series hybrid vehicle that meets consumer demands for range and performance.\"\nThe first wave of modern electric vehicles from Detroit and Japan are now being introduced. They rely on batteries to provide electrical energy, but their range is severely limited.\nGeneral Motors Corp. became the industry's first automaker to introduce a new-generation vehicle, the $35,000 two-seat EV1, which can only drive 60 to 70 miles between charges.\nAutomakers also are tinkering with hybrid electric vehicles, which use a small internal combustion engine to drive a generator that supplies electricity to drive the wheels. The cars also use an interim storage device, such as a battery or flywheel.\nAutomotive engineers say the major problem with such hybrids is their high cost -- they essentially use two separate powertrains, instead of just one in conventional internal combustion cars.\n", "Australian Treasurer Peter Costello on Wednesday announced the biggest financial reforms the country has seen since 1983, loosening restrictions on bank and life office mergers and foreign takeovers of banks.\nBut Costello stopped short of allowing mergers between Australia's big four banks -- Westpac, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), National Australia Bank (NAB) and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\"Today I announce the 'Six Pillars' policy is abolished,\" Costello told a news conference.\nThe \"Six Pillars\" policy, introduced by former Labor treasurer Paul Keating, prevented mergers between Australia's major banks and the two largest pension and life insurance groups, Australian Mutual Provident Society and National Mutual.\n\"The Treasurer will retain powers to reject mergers under relevant banking and insurance laws,\" said Costello, adding the major domestic banks would not be allowed to merge at this time.\n\"This will be reviewed when the government is satisfied that competition from new and established participants in the financial industry...has increased sufficiently to allow such mergers to be considered,\" he said.\nShares in Westpac and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group fell by around three percent as the two, previously seen as takeover targets, lost some of their sheen.\nIn contrast, NAB and Commonwealth Bank shares both rose as the market decided that they could fall prey to foreign predators. NAB had been seen as likely to mount a bid for Westpac and its price rise was also seen as a sign of relief that no such bid would happen.\nCostello also announced the end to an outright ban on foreign takeovers of Australian banks.\n\"The government has decided to reverse the blanket prohibition on foreign takeovers of any of the major banks,\" he said.\nBut Costello said any large-scale transfer of Australian ownership of the financial system to foreign hands would be contrary to the national interest.\n\"It can move off zero, but we won't allow it to go to sustantial foreign ownership,\" Costello said.\n\"We certainly would not allow it go as high as foreign ownership in the print media,\" Costello said. Foreign ownership of the print media was currently around 60 percent.\nCostello was responding to a government-appointed inquiry into the Australian financial system, which released its report on Wednesday recommending the biggest reforms in Australian financial industry since 1983, when the dollar was floated.\nFurther deregulation followed in 1984, when the government first allowed foreign banks to enter Australia.\nAustralia's year-old conservative government set up the Financial System Inquiry last June to boost competition.\n", "Hewlett-Packard Co., seeking to forge rapidly into the fast-growing area of electronic commerce, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire VeriFone Inc. in a stock swap worth $1.18 billion.\nHewlett-Packard said VeriFone, a leader in electronic payment hardware and software, will be operated as an independent unit of HP. Verifone stockholders will receive one HP share for each VeriFone share, the company said.\nForrester Research estimates the market for business to business electronic commerce will jump from $600 million last year to $66 billion in the year 2000, with consumer retail business rising to $7 billion from $530 million in 1996.\n\"When you talk about online commerce today, invariably you're talking about online payment. VeriFone is going to be the diamond in the crown in this area for some time to come,\" said Forrester Research analyst Karen Epper.\nHP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year.\nThe acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. HP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.\nVerifone jumped $17.625, or 59 percent, to $47.75, also in heavy trading on the NYSE.\nJP Morgan analyst Daniel Kunstler said the deal provides HP with some \"lynchpin technologies\" for electronic commerce, and although it will be slightly dilutive to HP's current fiscal year earnings, the impact should be less than one percent.\nRedwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone, which was founded in 1981 and pioneered automated credit card transaction systems, has recently expanded to include conducting business over the Internet and using \"smart-card\" products for the home.\nSmart cards have imbedded computer chips that can store so-called electronic cash and other information.\nJust last week, Citicorp's Citibank said it will launch a pilot program with VeriFone to test smart card use that will allow selected customers to download funds onto smart cards using its devices in their home or office.\nVeriFone estimates that its systems handled more than $520 billion of the $800 billion in electronic transactions conducted in the United States last year.\nThe acquisition is a further step in HP's drive to develop products for what it calls the \"on-ramps\" and \"off-ramps\" of the information superhighway, a business that includes computer printers and scanners, where HP is a dominant player already.\nHP said the two companies' technologies complement each other, with HP's focus on Internet security technologies and major corporate markets, including its broad distribution channels, melding with VeriFone's expertise in moving money.\n\"Central to HP's strategy to achieve this vision is the ability to move money securely from end to end over the Internet, an area VeriFone has pioneered through products and strategic relationships,\" HP Executive Vice President Rick Belluzzo said.\nThe companies' relationship includes providing products for the Visa/MasterCard Secure Electronic Transaction protocol, which is being rolled out this year, for secure credit-card payments over the Internet.\nAnalysts noted that other firms, many of them fledgeling startups like Cybercash, in which VeriFone holds a 10 percent stake, are also competing in what they expect will be an explosive market for electronic commerce systems and services.\n", "Canada is raising the amount of investment required of prospective immigrants seeking to settle in the country, Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard said on Friday.\nUnder a program designed to attract investment, one way foreigners seeking to live in Canada may be granted an immigrant visa is by pledging to invest in the economy.\nBut Robillard told a news conference the required amount would be raised to avoid abuse and to ensure adequate economic impact.\n\"While we won't be changing the basic selection criteria for investor entry to Canada, we will be changing the amounts needed to invest, the ways in which that capital can be used and the way in which the program is administered,\" she said.\n\"It's the most practical way to ensure growth and employment at the local level.\"\nShe denied that passage into Canada was for sale. \"Our citizenship is not for sale in this country,\" she said. \"The amount of money invested is not the only criteria here.\"\nInvestors account for about three percent of total immigration to Canada each year. Currently they must invest $250,000 Canadian ($180,000) to gain entry.\nThat is being raised to C$450,000 ($325,000) for the richest, most popular destinations -- Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. For the rest of Canada the rate will rise to C$350,000 ($250,000).\nAt least 60 percent of the capital must be invested in small and medium-sized businesses. The provinces will be able to direct the remaining 40 percent to their chosen priorities.\nThe immigrant investor program was introduced in 1986 to attract experienced business people and their money to Canada. The program has attracted C$3.75 billion ($2.74 billion) since its inception and created more than 33,000 jobs, Robillard said.\n", "Ivory Coast's cocoa mid-crop (May-Sept) could match harvest forecasts of over 150,000 tonnes but bean sizes are seen down from the record 1995/96 season (Oct-Sept), crop analysts and exporters said on Thursday.\n\"The development seems to be coming along quite nicely,\" said one. \"It is still early but I see no reason to suspect the mid-crop will be poor.\"\nGood peak wet season rains in June would decide the final mid-crop tally but this year's bean sizes are not expected to match the mainly exportable grades (105 beans per 100 grammes) seen in the record 1.2 million tonnes (total crop) 1995/96 year.\n\"Last year's mid-crop (200,000 tonnes) was exceptional. I think the sizes will return to more normal levels,\" said another crop analyst, pointing to a range of 110-120 range with lowest grades possibly touching 150.\nIvory Coast's main crop reached around one million tonnes by the season's closing date of April 27. Crop analysts expect the mid-crop to be down on 1995/96 with some early forecasts in a 160-180,000 tonnes range.\nCrop analysts said said plantation soil moiture levels had dropped in some areas after heavy wet season rains in April eased off in the first ten days of May.\n\"There was less moisture than I thought there would be, but it is not a problem,\" said one.\nBean sizes would swell if June rains were sufficient.\n\"I do not have a pessimistic view of mid-crop,\" said the analyst. \"As far as I am concerned soil humidity is average but our teams have not yet completed their tour.\"\nCrop analysts returning from upcountry farm inspections reported little harvesting and drying of cocoa. They did not expect mid-crop arrivals at port to strenghten until June -- after a lull in activity between the main and mid-crops.\n\"What is there will sit around for mixing in with better beans and larger quantities. It is just not worth the farmers selling yet,\" said one.\nExporters say late main crop and a trickle of mid-crop beans arriving at ports are in a 105-110 range.\n\"Last year, even the tail of the mid-crop met export standards,\" said one. Special contracts for grades outside the official export standard would still be exported.\n\"Discounts will be applied, as for poor coffee beans, but it will all be exported,\" he added.\nIvory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa crop by the year 2,000, partly to remove poorer grades from export markets, but also to push up world prices while adding export value.\nLocal processors, with three factories, have a total bean processing capacity of around 160,000 tonnes.\nThat figure could rise to at least 209,000 tonnes in 1996/97 as local factories build extensions and possible oil-palm factory capacity for cocoa bean processing comes on line.\nOther factories already under construction or in final planning stages could take Ivorian bean processing capacity to over 350,000 tonnes by 1998/99 (Corrects from 1997/98) -- without taking into account a raft of plans in early discussion stages.\n-- Abidjan newsroom, + 225 21 90 90\n", "Cathay Pacific Airways has raised air cargo rates from Hong Kong to compensate for higher fuel costs, cargo marketing and sales manager Ray Jewell told Reuters.\nHe declined to say by how much rates have been increased but said they have been introduced on a route by route basis \"wherever possible\" and not system-wide.\n\"There's been a huge cost associated with the increase in fuel and we have already had to make adjustments in our rates to compensate,\" Jewell said.\nOther major airlines told Reuters they are raising their ex-Hong Kong cargo rates in response to higher fuel costs after an attempt to impose an 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo fuel surcharge was turned down by the territory's Civil Aviation Department.\nThe 80 HK cents surcharge is the equivalent to the 10 U.S cents/kg fuel surcharge being levies by many airlines around the world.

Advertising will not be targeted at private chat rooms created by members themselves, the company said.\nAs an example, Oakes said sponsored chat rooms could include a Michael Jordan chat session with his fans, sponsored by Nike, or a health care discussion, sponsored by Johnson &amp; Johnson.\nDaytime TV talk show host Rosie O'Donnell's recent appearance set a record on America Online with more than 16,000 simultaneous participants signing on during the program, he said.\nAdding advertising to chat rooms represents America Online's latest bid to boost revenues from sources other than subscriber fees.\nLast week, America Online announced a deal with Tel-Save Holdings Inc., a long distance phone service provider, in which America Online received a $100 million payment from Tel-Save to market its long-distance services to America Online members.\nThe online service has said it expected an increasing portion of its revenues to come from ads instead of just subcriber fees as it grows beyond its roots as an online access company to become a diversified media company.\n\"This is yet another asset that we have that will allow America Online to capture an ever larger percentage of online and Internet advertising spending,\" Pittman said of the plan to mix advertising with online chat sessions.\nAmerica Online is the world's largest Internet online service with about 8 million members.\n", "The United States on Friday said it would grant 10-year multiple-entry visas to holders of Hong Kong passports issued after China takes back the territory, clearing a major worry here about travel rights.\nU.S. Consul-General Richard Boucher said holders of future Hong Kong passports would get the same visa treatment now enjoyed by holders of Hong Kong British travel documents.\n\"We intend to issue maximum validity visas for the United States for people with the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) passport,\" Boucher told reporters.\nThe decision was a milestone in international recognition of the future SAR passport and removed a question mark hanging over Hong Kong as China prepares to resume sovereignty at midnight on June 30, ending 156 years of British colonial rule.\nFrom July 1, the territory of 6.4 million people will become a Special Administrative Region of China, and winning easy travel access to major destinations is viewed as a barometer of confidence in the territory's future prospects.\nEasy travel rights are also seen as key to maintaining Hong Kong's position as an international business and tourism centre.\nSo far, nine countries -- Britain, Singapore, Canada, the Philippines, Western Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Namibia, Benin, and San Marino -- have gone further to grant full visa-free entry for SAR passports, but other nations have hesitated.\nJapan, for example, has said it will treat SAR passports more favourably than Chinese passports, but it has not yet revealed details.\nBoucher said the same visa application procedures and conditions for approval as now would apply after the handover for Hong Kong people wishing to visit the United States.\n\"The same application procedures, the same forms, the same facilities will apply...the requirements are exactly the same. The decisions on yes or no are exactly the same,\" he said.\nHong Kong Director of Immigration Regina Ip welcomed Washington's decision and saw it as a confidence booster.\n\"Absolutely, this will be a very useful confidence booster. So far, nine countries will give visa-free treatment to Hong Kong SAR passports...a few more are considering and we will probably have a lot more before July 1,\" she said.\nIn return, U.S. citizens would be accorded the same visa-free entry privilege which they now enjoy, she said.\n\"Current arrangements are that they may do so without a visa for visits up to one month. The Hong Kong government has no plans to change the current practice,\" Ip said.\nWhile the status of Hong Kong people travelling to the United States after July 1 has become clearer, questions still hang over locals with U.S. passports but who want to hold on to their Hong Kong permanent residency.\nChina, which does not recognise dual nationality, has said ethnic Chinese Hong Kong residents will be regarded as Chinese nationals with no right to foreign consular protection unless they declare their foreign citizenship.\nBoucher indicated that Hong Kong residents with U.S. passports should make use of them when crossing borders to make clear their citizenship.\n\"An American citizen is an American citizen and we will endeavour to assist (them) whenever they need assistance.\n\"By taking advantage of their passports, it's easier for both sides to understand who is regarded an American and how we can protect them,\" Boucher said.\nSeparately, U.S. Ambassader to Beijing James Sasser told a business lunch in Hong Kong that Washington would keep a keen eye on the territory after the handover.\n\"Americans have invested $15 billion here. To sustain this U.S. presence requires a society governed by the rule of law and protection of basic freedom,\" he said.\n", "Conrail Inc. on Friday spurned a sweetened $10.5 billion takeover offer from hostile suitor Norfolk Southern Corp. amid speculation that a 2-month-old bidding war for the railroad was drawing to a close.\nAs expected, Conrail rejected the offer and contended that its proposed friendly $9.3 billion merger with CSX Corp. would be a better corporate combination.\n\"The Conrail board has again confirmed that a merger of equals with CSX and not a sale to Norfolk Southern is in the best interests of Conrail and its constituencies, including shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and communities served,\" Conrail Chairman David LeVan said in a statement.\nThe rejection came just one day after both CSX and Norfolk Southern raised their bids for Conrail.\nIndustry analysts said CSX and Norfolk Southern were unlikely to offer much more for the Philadelphia-based railroad, but both sides will pursue the fight in court, before regulators and in the marketplace.\n\"That is the whole process that takes place over the course of 1997 -- the battle for market share as opposed to Conrail shares,\" said NatWest Securities Corp. analyst Anthony Hatch.\nOn Thursday, Richmond, Va.-based CSX raised its offer for Conrail to give shareholders an extra $870 million in the cash-and-stock merger. Based on Friday's stock activity, the deal is worth $9.3 billion, or about $102 per Conrail share.\nA source close to CSX told Reuters then that CSX and Conrail hoped the revised deal would end the bidding war.\nBut just hours after CSX and Conrail unveiled the new terms of their planned merger, Norfolk Southern raised its all-cash offer by $500 million to about $10.5 billion, or $115 a share.\n\"If someone were to start to bid higher than this, they probably wouldn't get the economies out of the deal to make it work, so the bidding war, I think, has come to the end,\" said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group.\nAlthough Norfolk Southern's bid has been higher throughout the two-month takeover fight, Conrail contends the union with CSX is a better strategic fit.\nIndustry experts said Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, which has the financial power to bid more than $10.5 billion, merely wants to preserve the spread between the two offers while it fights a key aspect of the Conrail-CSX pact in court.\nNorfolk Southern is challenging part of the transaction that prohibits either CSX or Conrail from seeking another merger partner before 1999.\nSome analysts and investors said that if the exclusivity provision is not thrown out after a Jan. 9 hearing before a federal judge in Philadelphia, it could guarantee a victory for CSX because shareholders would not wait two years for a deal with Norfolk Southern.\nNorfolk Southern last month lost a court fight in which it challenged previous terms of the deal, including an exclusivity provision that ruled out other talks before July 1997.\n\"This is a sign that they're not going to go bananas (with a very high offer). If they're able to break the lock-up provision, they have a good bid,\" Hatch said.\n\"It was the right thing to do to keep pressure on the (Conrail) board,\" said one takeover stock trader, referring to investors who were unhappy with Conrail's decision to pursue the lower of the two bids.\nThe court case is expected to hinge on whether Conrail's agreeing to the extended exclusivity period falls within the broad discretion allowed a board under Pennsylvania law, said Charles Yablon, a professor of corporate law at Cardozo University in New York.\n\"They're pushing the outside of the envelope and trying to take maximum advantage of the leeway that Pennsylvania law gives them,\" Yablon said. But if they can legally justify the move, CSX will probably prevail in court, he said.\nFew Wall Street analysts were predicting the outcome, but the war was expected to drag on no matter which company wins in court.\nAfter the court fight, the next battle site will be Washington where the losing bidder is expected to vehemently challenge the merger. The deal already is expected to face intense scrutiny from the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that oversees railroads.\n\"You're going to have a lot of opposition to this,\" PNC's Vincent said, citing railroads, shippers and state agencies which are expected to express their opinions when the transaction reaches the regulatory stage.\nLast week, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it would intervene in any merger involving Conrail.\nConrail stock fell 87.5 cents to $99.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock fell 50 cents to $43.25 and Norfolk Southern shares rose $1.125 to $89.50, also on NYSE.\n", "Hewlett-Packard Co. said it plans to introduce a photographic system for personal computer users capable of snapping, scanning and printing photography-quality images.\nThe company's new PhotoSmart line, aimed at the consumer digital photography which some industry experts expect to heat up this year, will not come cheaply, however.\nThe company's photo printer, scanner and digital camera can be purchased independently but together cost about $1,400, while new ink cartridges will cost roughly $40 each.\nAnd while any paper can be used in the printer, for best results HP recommends its own glossy and deluxe glossy photography paper, to be priced in the United States at up to $1.10 a page for the finest quality.\nA spokesman for HP said the products are initially aimed at photography enthusiasts.\nHP cited figures from the Photo Marketing Association which estimated that in 1995 some 710 million rolls of film were processed, or an estimated 2.5 billion pictures.\nAlthough the quality of consumer market digital cameras themselves is still well below that of conventional photography, HP's scanning device enables PC users to scan, edit and print images made with conventional photography as well.\nThe HP PhotoSmart products work with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 operating system and at least a 66- megahertz 486 processor, although Intel Corp.'s Pentium chips are recommended.\nBoth the printer and scanner, which will be available beginning in May, require a 2x-speed CD-ROM device, although a 4x-speed CD-ROM is recommended.\nThe printer, priced at about $500, requires at least 16 megabytes of random access memory (RAM) and 80 megabytes of hard disk storage, although double as much RAM and 120 megabytes of storage are recommended.\nHP's PhotoSmart scanner, priced at $500 in the U.S. market, requires eight megabytes of RAM, a SCSI card and 25 megabytes of hard disk space, although 16 megabytes of RAM and 50 megabytes of hard disk space are recommended.\nPhotography professionals said the difference between the output of the new HP devices and conventional photo printing methods can be detected by experts, but that the two are very similar in quality.\nHP's new inkjet printing system will enable people to print their pictures right away at home, although the results will not be instantaneous.\nAn eight-by-ten-inch picture takes an average five minutes to print and will take three to 20 minutes to dry, depending on the paper, print quality and humidity.\nHP has been working with companies to expand PC photography standards. Last week, it unveiled a new standard to promote browsing, distributing and printing high-resolution images over the Internet.\n", "Citrix Systems Inc. stock surged 69 percent Monday after Microsoft Corp. agreed to license its software technology and include it in upcoming versions of Microsoft Windows NT.\nAs part of the agreement, Citrix, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., will get an initial $75 million fee from Microsoft and as much as $100 million in royalties tied to sales of Microsoft products using Citrix technology, the companies said.\nCitrix shares jumped $13.375 to $32.625 on trading of 12.9 million shares on Nasdaq, where it was the most active stock.\nCitrix writes software that lets an old PC or an outdated terminal -- a type of computer that gets its computing horsepower from a corporate network -- run programmes written for Microsoft's Windows.\nMonday's agreement erased much of the concern in recent months about Citrix. In February, Citrix's stock plunged after Microsoft told Citrix executives that if the companies could not agree to develop the technology together, Microsoft would go it alone.\nMicrosoft agreed to add Citrix's so-called multi-user technology to Windows NT, which would let several terminal users share one server for running common business software, such as data-entry and word processing.\nThe agreement makes it easier for Citrix to sell additional products to Windows NT customers, analysts said.\n\"Basically, Citrix now has Windows NT pre-enabled for their products,\" said John Powers, analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. in San Francisco. \"For Citrix, it's good that Microsoft has multi-user capabilites. It's even better that it's from Citrix.\"\nThe agreement also is a shift in strategy for Microsoft. In recent months, Microsoft, after initially ridiculing the idea, has taken the idea of stripped-down network computers seriously. Big corporate customers have been clamouring for cheaper and easier-to-use machines that do not require the latest in software and hardware gadgets.\nMicrosoft also said Monday it agreed to license technology from France's Prologue Software SA, another company that writes terminal software.\nMicrosoft, based in Redmond, Wash., owns a 6 percent stake in Citrix. Microsoft's treasurer, Greg Maffei, also sits on Citrix's board.\nSome analysts, however, were cautious about Citrix's outlook in coming years. As Microsoft adds more multi-user functions to Windows NT, customers might not need separate Citrix products.\n\"That's what I have warned our investors about,\" said Dawn Simon, analyst at investment bank Furman Selz in New York. \"It's a truce between the companies, but the burden will be on Citrix to innovate.\"\nUnder the agreement, Citrix will get up to $100 million in royalties from Microsoft. Mark Templeton, Citrix vice president of worldwide marketing, said it is not clear whether Citrix will get a new royalty contract once Citrix gets all of the original $100 million.\n", "Canada's venerable Eaton's department store chain, under bankruptcy protection, said on Wednesday it placed 31 of 85 stores under review as U.S. vulture brokerages swooped down on its C$150 million (US$110 million) supplier debt.\nToronto-based T. Eaton Co. Ltd., Canada's fifth largest chain with annual sales of C$1.67 billion (US$1.22 billion), said it would renegotiate leases for the stores under review, as part of restructuring plan it filed on February 27.\nEaton's is expected to eventually close some of the stores under review as it tries to grapple with its mounting losses in Canada's competitive retail market.\nThe 127-year-old retailer owned by one of Canada's richest families, the Eatons, owes C$150 million (US$110 million) to suppliers and another C$160 million (US$118 million) to two of the nation's largest banks, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank.\nEaton's has seen up to C$40 million ($29 million) of its C$150 million ($110 million) supplier debt snapped up by U.S. vulture brokerages, the firm said on Wednesday. The brokerages are trading the debt at a discount on behalf of their clients.\nThe U.S. brokerages are using names on their lists of suppliers garnerned from previous bankruptcy protection filings, such as Canadian clothing retailer Dylex Ltd.. Suppliers, eager to recoup some of their claims as soon as possible, sold their debt at a range of 50 to 81 percent of the dollar, they said.\nBear Stearns' Director of Bankruptcy and Research, David Goldburg, guessed that up to C$40 million ($29 million) has been bought.\nBDS Securities Senior Managing Director Scott Donahue said his firm has bought between C$13 million ($9.5 million) to C$15 million ($11 million) which in turn has been sold to clients who trade it.\nDonahue said that the market has likely topped out at offers of C$0.81 on the dollar, since the Eaton family may demand its suppliers to shave something off their demands to be paid in full.\n\"You have to assume that if the Eaton family risked their equity stake in this venerable old chain by filing under CCAA (Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act), they're going to try to get the unsecured claimants to take some kind of haircut,\" Donahue said.\nDonahue also said the Eaton family, which consists of four brothers and their offspring, will have to work very hard to cut corporate expenses which is typically easier for outsiders.\n\"For 85 stores, it's dramatically higher than you would expect it to be, which is not so unusual in family owned and operated companies,\" he said. \"A lot of Eatons in the trough.\"\nEaton's might stretch out its time frame to reorganize and pay creditors, which would cut into the traders' profits. \"At these levels you're not allowing yourself much margin for error,\" Bright said.\nBut the U.S. vultures are not interested in pushing Eaton's into bankruptcy, Donahue said. \"They would prefer to be passive investors\" and eventually reap value, he said.\n((lydia.zajc@reuters.com, Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8109))\n", "Cambridge Antibody Technology Group Plc (CAT) said late on Wednesday that it expected to forge a major genetics alliance in the next 12 months.\nIn an interview with Reuters, chief executive officer David Chiswell said a link would bring together CAT's ability to use the body's own defenses against disease with the thousands of potential disease targets being unlocked by work to crack the genetic code.\n\"We will do at least one major new deal which will acquire targets...in the next 12 months,\" Chiswell said.\nThere has been speculation that CAT, which hopes to float on the stock exchange before the end of March, could forge a link with SmithKline Beecham Plc, which has established a strong position in breaking the genetic code, or genome, through a link with Human Genome Sciences.\nBut Chiswell declined to be drawn on the identity of any likely partner.\n\"It will be a genomics-element deal,\" he said. \"Whether it's with a genomics firm or whether its with a pharmaceutical company with access to genomics we are leaving in the air.\"\nCAT is pioneering work in human antibodies, which are produced by cells in the immune system to help combat invading substances like viruses and bacteria. Scientists believe antibodies could be used like missiles to target drugs exactly where they are needed in the body.\nOther companies, like Britain's Celltech Group Plc, have concentrated on developing mice antibodies. Chiswell said CAT has effectively \"captured\" the hundreds of millions of variations in antibodies which the human body produces to protect itself.\nCAT, which grew out of work conducted by the Medical Research Council, already licenses its technology to major companies including Genentech Inc, Eli Lilly &amp; Co chemicals  and Pfizer Inc.\nChiswell said CAT's techniques allow companies to test for potential antibody targets in a matter of days rather than up to six months with other methods.\n\"You give them a huge benefit in trying to get a handle on the function of any particular gene sequence...(perhaps) a ten- or a hundred-fold improvement in productivity in that particular activity.\"\nBut Chiswell has ambitious goals for CAT's own drug development programme, which is still in its infancy. CAT hopes to raise 30 to 35 million stg through its flotation, valuing it at 85 to 100 million stg. CAT plans to use the funds to develop over the next two years to the point where it can \"put three or four new clinical programmes in place every year from 2000.\"\nCAT is developing a human antibody drug with potential against rheumatoid arthritis with Germany's BASF AG, which is expected to start clinical trials in the next few months. A similar drug could be targeted against Crohn's disease, a poorly treated illness in the small intestine.\nBoth would compete directly with mouse antibody products being developed by Celltech and Centocor Inc of the United States, but Chiswell said CAT's product should prove to be more easily tolerated by the human body. Other programmes include drugs to improve the success of operations for detached retina and glaucoma, and Chiswell said CAT hoped to have antibody drugs for cancer and obesity in the clinic in 1998 or 1999.\n--London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n", "London-based international bank HSBC Holdings Plc on Monday posted a 23 percent rise in 1996 profits but chief executive John Bond said it saw a challenging year ahead amid increasing competition.\nBond said HSBC, which gets 55 percent of its profits from the Asia-Pacific region, had a strong capital position and balance sheet, making it ready to meet that competition head-on.\n\"We see 1997 as a challenging year wherever we look whether it be Asia or the UK, the competition continues to increase,\" Bond said in an interview.\nHe also told a news conference that HSBC, one of the world's largest banking groups, wanted to make insurance an international core activity.\n\"We see the biggest growth potential in the Asia-Pacific region, we are already doing it in Hong Kong and we want to roll it out to other countries,\" Bond told reporters.\nHSBC announced a 23 percent rise in pretax profits for 1996 to 4.52 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) -- around the middle of market expectations. A hefty nine pence per share rise in the annual dividend to 41 pence bettered most forecasts.\nBond said HSBC's British unit Midland Bank would continue to grow organically, as the price of acquisitions was impossible to justify to shareholders.\nMidland, one of Britain's big four clearing banks, put in a strong performance with pretax profits up more than 20 percent and costs held to a rise of less than one percent, Bond said.\nHSBC's capital ratios were strong with tier one capital rising to 9.9 percent from 9.5 percent at the end of 1995 and Bond said he did not see surplus capital being generated.\n\"As long as we're making a respectable return on capital, we regard capital strength as an asset in our business,\" Bond said. \"It helps you with the ratings, it helps with deposits in Asia and to have a strong capital position shows in the bottom line.\"\nHSBC had a 21.3 percent return on capital in 1996 compared with 20.7 percent in 1995.\nBond said HSBC continues to be confident over Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese rule in July.\nLast year, HSBC was granted a licence to trade in the Chinese yuan and Bond said the bank talking to the Chinese authorities to see how this would work.\nHSBC was looking at this massive potential business opportunity in the long-term, he said.\n\"I think it will take time, of course it will, but the signs are all positive.\"\nBond said the rise of sterling against the dollar had not had a great effect on the group's results in 1996 where the average rate for the pound against the dollar was below that of 1995.\nHe said that, very roughly, for every cent the pound goes up against the dollar, the bank loses 13 million pounds in profits.\nAnalysts said the results held few surprises and were not expecting to change their forecasts for 1997 in any major way.\nNick Collier of Morgan Stanley who expects 1997 pre-tax profits of 4.94 billion pounds said he might raise this estimate marginally.

Earnings from timberlands and wood products were virtually flat at $805 million, compared with $808 million.\nPortland, Ore.-based Louisiana-Pacific Corp. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $14.7 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $567 million, compared with net income of $26.8 million or 25 cents a share on sales of $670.3 million a year earlier.\nFor the year the company reported a net loss of $201 million, or $1.87 a share, blamed mainly on a pre-tax charge of $350 million for the closing of its pulp mill in Ketchikan, Alaska.\nIn 1995 the company had a loss of $51.7 million or 48 cents a share including a pretax charge of $366.6 million mainly to account for the settlement of class-action lawsuits over the company's siding.\nLouisiana-Pacific chairman and chief executive officer Mark Suwyn said the company had resolved key legal and organizational issues in 1996 but still faced an oversupply in the market for its key product of oriented strand board, used in building.\nLouisiana-Pacific stock closed up 25 cents at $21.\nClayton, Mo.-based Jefferson Smurfit Corp. posted net income of $14 million, or 13 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, down from $64 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were $816 million, compared with $973 million.\nFor the full year the company earned $112 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $243 million, or $2.19 a share. Sales fell to $3.4 billion from $4.1 billion in 1995.\nCompany president and chief executive officer Richard Graham said inventories in containerboard and newsprint have declined steadily over the past several months, promising some relief to the weak pricing environment.\n\"Given continued economic expansion, we could see a recovery in the company's principal markets during the second half of 1997,\" he said.\nJefferson Smurfit fell 43.75 cents to close at $15.06 on Nasdaq.\n", "The battle for UK digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences is a David and Goliath contest pitting three of the country's biggest broadcasting groups against a little known cable company.\nDTN, owned by Nasdaq-listed International CableTel, finds itself up against the might of pay television giant British Sky Broadcasting and ITV companies Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc.\nBut International CableTel chief executive Barclay Knapp has not yet raised the white flag as Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) considers the two bids.\n\"We are presenting ourselves as the ones that win on the merits,\" Knapp said in an interview on Wednesday.\n\"We are going to create an environment for new British programming to proliferate and to very aggressively exploit the interactive services component,\" he added.\nKnapp believes that the successful launch of DTT is the best way to challenge BSkyB's dominance of UK pay television.\nHe also maintains that major programme makers and suppliers should not be left to run broadcast networks.\nDTT signals are broadcast from land-based transmitters to ordinary aerials but viewers need a set-top box or decoder to view what is broadcast.\nDigital compression improves sound and picture quality and means that more than 30 channels can be picked up. The technology permits a link to interactive services.\nDTN and the rival British Digital Broadcasting consortium are each bidding for the same three blocks of frequencies, capable of carrying some 18 channels.\nThe ITC decision on the award of the licences is expected around May and DTT would begin in the spring or summer of 1998.\nBSkyB plans separately to launch digital satellite services with up to 200 channels into the UK late this year and DTN questions its commitment to making the terrestrial version work.\nInternational CableTel, the company behind DTN, has almost all its operations in the UK, where it is the third largest cable operator and also owns the NTL transmission network.\nIt believes its skills in programme packaging and marketing make it the ideal candidate to run DTT frequencies. Knapp points to International Cabletel's success in securing take up of around 40 percent in some of its cable franchise areas.\n\"Sports and movies are good for the first 20 percent in take-up but the two remaining factors are the breadth of choice and pricing,\" he said.\nInternational CableTel breaks its programme packages down into tiers such as news or natural history to bring on board those not tempted by soccer or Hollywood blockbusters.\nHe believes that customers could be offered a limited package of say five extra DTT channels for around six pounds per month to get them to sample the multi-channel future.\n\"People don't want to dive right in, they just want to get their feet wet,\" he said.\n", "Chrysler Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Eaton said Tuesday that the automaker will report record earnings for the full 1996 year, based on record worldwide sales of 2.97 million vehicles.\n\"We're going to have a record year,\" Eaton told Reuters in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show.  \nChrysler's previous annual profit record came in 1994, when the company earned $3.713 billion. It earned $2.025 billion in 1995, when sales were held to 2.61 million units by the launch of its current line of minivans.\nEaton also said Chrysler in 1997 should be able to exceed its 1996 sales results because the company will be able to produce about 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than it built in 1996.  \nThe increase will be made up of added capacity for the new Dodge Durango sport/utility vehicle in Newark, Del., as well as increased line speeds for the Dodge Ram pickup truck in St. Louis, and increased production of Dodge Dakota pickup trucks in Warren, Mich.\nChrysler plans to unveil the Durango at the Detroit auto show later Tuesday.  \nIn other capacity moves, Eaton also said Chrysler has tentatively planned to add a third production shift to its Bramalea, Ontario, car assembly plant after it launches production of a new generation of LH family sedans later this year.\nThe LH line includes the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and LHS and Eagle Vision, which also are expected to be introduced at the show.\nEaton said despite sluggish industry car sales the increasing popularity and profitability of light truck models, the automaker has not cut back on investment in future car programs.  \nHowever, he said Chrysler may shift its investment plans if trucks continue to gain market share. \"We're going to put the money where the market goes,\" he said, adding that new, more efficient truck engines should allow Chrysler to continue to increase truck capacity without violating federal fuel economy laws.  \nEaton said he is pleased with the financial stability that Chrysler has acheived in recent years, but it still needs to continue to prove itself to Wall Street to earn a higher stock price and raise its price-to-earnings ratio above the current level of 7.3 percent. Chrysler shares were trading down 1/4 at 35-3/8.\nHe reiterated that Chrysler can earn still earn a profit even if U.S. automotive industry sales fall by 20 percent.\n", "A Hong Kong human rights group reacted with scepticism on Tuesday to China's declaration that it would subscribe to a United Nations' human rights convention.\nChina, embroiled in controversy over its human rights record, said on Monday it will sign the U.N. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights before the end of 1997.\nPaul Harris, who heads the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor and closely watches rights developments related to Hong Kong, said the move seemed to be a bid to dodge international censure in a debate at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva this week.\n\"I'm unimpressed,\" Harris told Reuters.\n\"The timing is obviously designed to reduce the risk of China being condemned in the debate at the United Nations.\n\"I'm very sceptical whether it will be carried out,\" Harris said of Beijing's avowed intention to sign the convention.\nHe said Monday's pledge by President Jiang Zemin to visiting French Defence Minister Charles Millon did not make clear if Beijing would go all the way and ratify the covenant in full.\nOnce the Geneva debate had blown over, China would probably just \"forget about it\", Harris said.\nHe questioned why China, in its latest move, had referred only to the so-called \"ECOSOC\" human rights covenant, and not to the other more important U.N. convention, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\nChina has in the past resisted making any commitment to observe international human rights standards and rarely submits reports on the human rights situation on its own turf, where hundreds of dissidents languish in jail.\nChina also resists the notion of submitting human rights reports on Hong Kong, a British colony that reverts to Beijing's control on July 1, under an international treaty that requires ICCPR human rights standards to be applied in the territory.\nBoth U.N. covenants would require China to submit regular reports on compliance with standards laid down in the documents, but membership could also give China a voice on the international committee monitoring the accords.\nHarris said there had been no signs of any liberalisation in China's attitude toward dissent in recent months.\n", "Technology stocks jumped Wednesday amid investor optimism that major computer, software and chip companies will report solid earnings.\nTechnology stocks also responded to a slew of optimistic investment recommendations from analysts, who have said in recent days that the shares are undervalued.\n\"A number of people, including yours truly, believe it's time to start nibbling again on the stocks that form the technology infrastructure,\" said Bruce Lupatkin, director of research at investment bank Hambrecht &amp; Quist Group Inc. in San Francisco.\nThe month-long sharp decline of stocks like Cisco Systems Inc., Netscape Communications Corp. and Oracle Corp. represents a buying opportunity, Lupatkin said.\nCisco, the world's biggest network equipment maker, jumped $4.50 to $52.375 on Nasdaq trading of 18 million shares, making the issue the most active in U.S. markets.\nIntel Corp., the world's biggest computer chipmaker, rose $7.375 to $140.625. Microsoft Corp., the biggest PC software company, gained $3.94 to $94.25. And Oracle, the No. 1 database software company, rose $1.50 to $40.50.\nAnalysts have said in recent weeks that technology sales seem to be slowing because of the strengthening dollar, weak sales in Europe and Japan and slow consumer sales. Stocks like Intel, Cisco and 3Com Corp. slumped on those expectations.\nBut some stocks slumped too far.\nOn Tuesday, John Skeen and Thomas Thornhill, the influential directors of research at Montgomery Securities Inc., said they believe the recent lows in stocks like Cisco, Oracle and Intel are \"buying opportunities.\"\nBased on Cisco's low share price and earnings prospect, the stock's rating was raised on Wednesday to a \"buy\" at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross in New York.\n\"We think the stock is extremely undervalued at these levels,\" said Larry Rice, Josephthal's director of research.\nOther stocks that gained Wednesday include 3Com, up $2.125 to $35.50; Dell Computer Corp., up $3.94 to $71.44; and Micron Technology Inc. up $2.125 to $40.875.\nSome analysts said, however, the one-day rally might not last.\n\"It's going to be volatile for a while, I think,\" said John Rohal, managing director at Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co. in San Francisco.

Inc.\n\"The information business is very competitive; the newspaper business isn't,\" said John Morton, an independent newspaper analyst.\nThe Disney/ABC newspapers include The Kansas City Star, the Fort Worth and Arlington (Texas) Star-Telegrams, the Belleville (Ill.) News-Democrat and The Times Leader in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., it said. Revenue for the group was $500 million in 1996.\nLast year, Knight-Ridder sold its Knight-Ridder Financial business news unit for about $275 million to Global Information Corp. It also got out of the cable television business, reporting an after-tax gain earlier in 1997 of $130 million to $150 million.\n\"Kansas City and Fort Worth are models of locally edited, reader-friendly and marketing savvy publications. Both evidence strong on-line literacy as well. All of these are critical qualities in today's competitive environment,\" said Chairman Tony Ridder.\nHe said much of the company's revenus comes from medium and smaller-market newspapers, and the Belleville and Wilkes-Barre papers \"will be strong contributors to that group. Both papers have shown steady revenue increases since 1993, with profit growth and strong margins.\"\nABC was purchased by Disney in 1996 for $19 billion. The company has since said it planned to divest some of its publishing entities, but it has not been specific.\nBecause of the proposed purchases, Knight-Ridder's earnings during the first 12 months will be diluted by about 10 percent. Minimal dilution will occur during the second year and earnings will show gains during the third year, Knight-Ridder said.\nKnight-Ridder said it would finance the deal by issuing $660 million in convertible preferred stock and assuming $990 million of pre-existing debt. It also said it planned to buy back at least 15 million common shares during the next 12 months.\nMorton said the Disney/ABC papers were already strong performers financially and that the operating monies from the papers would more or less cover the new interest payments Knight-Ridder will be making.\nWall Street would be put off by the deal when stock trading resumes on Monday, since many institutional investors worry about the long-term outlook for newspapers, Morton said. Knight-Ridder was not trading in after-hours dealings Friday.\nKnight-Ridder is an international communications company engaged in newspaper publishing, business news and information services, among other things.\nKnight-Ridder said the deal should close within 60 days.\n", "Microsoft Corp.'s fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 85 percent to $1.04 billion, well beyond analysts' expectations, on strength in its core business, including sales of its Office 97 upgrade, the world's largest software company reported Thursday.\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated that he expects results in the current fourth quarter to be similar to the quarter ended March 31, which he termed \"sizzling.\"\nBut in an interview Brown also said he expects Microsoft's growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons with year-earlier quarters and a lack of planned major new upgrades.\nNet income, equal to 79 cents a share, rose from earnings of $562 million a year ago, or 44 cents a share, in the third quarter. The number easily topped Wall Street's consensus analyst forecast of 64 cents a share, according to First Call.\nRevenues totalled $3.21 billion, a 45 percent increase over the $2.21 billion racked up in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average had predicted revenues of about $2.9 billion.\nMicrosoft released its latest results after financial markets closed. In after-hours trading, the Redmond, Wash.-based company's stock jumped $4.625 to $102.75 from its Nasdaq closing price, dealers said.\n\"Worldwide acceptance of Microsoft Office 97 ignited these outstanding results,\" Brown said in a statement.\nOffice 97, the latest upgrade of the company's best-selling software package, was launched in January. It combines \"productivity applications\" such as word processing and spreadsheets that accounted for an estimated $2 billion of the company's $8.7 billion in the prior fiscal year.\nBrown said Microsoft also realised \"solid gains\" from sales of operating systems.\nMicrosoft makes the bulk of its money from \"platforms,\" including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers, which generate about one-third of the company's revenues.\n\"However,\" Brown cautioned, \"incredible results like these are seldom duplicated, and we are mindful of the very tough comparisons we will have in fiscal 1998.\"\nBrown said in the interview that the first quarter of fiscal 1998 could show a downturn from the fourth fiscal quarter of 1997. He said he expected results to rise sequentially after that.\nBrown said he expected a spike in revenues from the Office 97 upgrade would begin to tail off in the current quarter, although deferred revenues from product shipped earlier would prevent a sequential downturn.\nThe next upgrade of Office will not be out until fiscal 1999, Brown said.\n\"So, fiscal '98 is in the product cycle valley from a comparison standpoint, and that makes the comparison tough, even if business fundamentals are very good,\" he said.\nBrown said he expected the revenue surge from the Windows 95 operating system to begin to tail off soon now that the product has been out 20 months.\nBrown said he was \"very excited\" about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an \"all-time Olympic record.\"\n\"We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS (earnings pr share) went up 80 percent,\" he said. \"That's not a quarter-in, quarter-out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter.\"\n", "Eli Lilly &amp; Co is fighting in Kentucky this week to end the last major legal battle still lingering from Prozac's liability troubles of the early 1990s.\nThe Indianapolis-based drug giant Wednesday asked the Kentucky Court of Appeals to halt a hearing set for Thursday in Louisville before Jefferson Circuit Judge John Potter.\nPotter's hearing would likely reveal publicly how and for how much Lilly and plaintiffs agreed to end a landmark case involving Prozac and a 1989 mass murder in Louisville.  \nLilly wants to keep the details of the agreement under wraps, although it conceded for the first time Monday that the so-called Joseph Wesbecker case was settled, at least in part.\nFor months, the company had said only that it reached a pre-verdict agreement in the case and that an unspecified amount of money changed hands as a result.\n\"We acknowledge that after the jury verdict, the high-low agreement provided for settlement of the compensatory and punitive damage phases of the trial,\" said Lilly spokesman Edward West Wednesday in a telephone interview.  \nThat acknowledgment allowed Potter to amend the Wesbecker verdict to say the case was \"dismissed as settled\" -- a legal intricacy he and Lilly have wrangled over since 1994.\n\"After nearly two-and-a-half years of this, we and the plaintiffs said to (Potter) Monday ... enter your corrected judgment. If that's what you think you need to do to be at peace with this matter, then do that,\" West said. \"It's time to put this matter to rest ... We have nothing to hide.\"  \nWall Street considers the disputed deal that ended the Wesbecker case a non-event. Analysts said major drug companies often pay plaintiffs \"hush money\" in liability cases, but Lilly has fought any revelations by Potter's court about the company's arrangement with the Wesbecker plaintiffs.\n\"There is a confidentiality agreement in place ... We've honored that,\" West said.\nIn 1989, while on Prozac and other drugs, 47-year-old Joseph Wesbecker walked into his former workplace in Louisville with an AK-47 assault rifle and went on a shooting rampage.  \nHe killed eight people, wounded 12, and then committed suicide.\nSurvivors of the Standard Gravure Printing plant massacre and victims' families sued Lilly for $50 million, alleging that Prozac drove Wesbecker to his horrible end. A flood of more than 160 similar legal actions followed and Prozac came under national legal and scientific scrutiny.\nPotter presided over the 47-day Wesbecker lawsuit trial in late 1994 and early 1995.  \nThe jury found Lilly not liable in the case and Potter dismissed it. But in April 1995, he had second thoughts because he said he suspected the case had been secretly settled out of court. He filed a motion that the verdict be changed to say that the case was \"dismissed as settled.\"\nLilly fought the motion, but the Kentucky Supreme Court ordered Potter to look into the matter because, the court said, it suspected \"there may have been deception, bad faith conduct, abuse of the judicial process or perhaps even fraud.\"  \nAn investigation was conducted by a lawyer for the Kentucky attorney general's office. The probe revealed the nature and cost of the pre-verdict agreement that Lilly has since acknowledged making. But many of the facts surrounding the agreement, including its price-tag, remain under wraps.\nPotter declined to comment Tuesday on the objectives of the hearing he hopes to convene.\nWest said, \"Judge Potter ... has stated on the record he intends to release the aggregate amount of the agreement.\"\nTo this day, Lilly defends Prozac as safe and has been backed by panels of medical experts. Until this week, the company also contended it had never lost or settled any of the Prozac court cases. Despite the settlement of the damages phase of the Wesbecker trial, West said, the fact remains that the jury cleared Lilly on the question of liability.\n\"They heard everything about Prozac and decided that the product had nothing to do with Wesbecker's actions,\" he said.\n((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787))\n", "Anglo-Dutch food to detergent company Unilever Plc/NV is unlikely to bid for French food group Danone as it would clash with its strategy and come up against big regulatory hurdles, said analysts.\n\"I think it would be unlikely,\" Paribas analyst John Campbell said on Thursday.\nUnilever earlier would not comment on the rumours.\nSince Unilever announced the sale of its speciality chemicals division earlier this month, expected to fetch some 5 billion stg, Unilever's name has been linked with a host of potential takeover targets including Cadbury-Schweppes and Reckitt and Coleman, sending their shares higher, but few of them fit the Unilever strategy, said analysts.\nCadbury-Schweppes, is too big in Britain and Unilever is reluctant to enter the soft drinks market especially in view of stiff competition from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, said analysts.\nC-S would also bring with it relatively high debt levels -- net debt stood at 1.617 billion stg on June 15, 1996 and gearing at 121 percent, before the sale of its 51 percent stake in Coca Cola and Schweppes Beverages Ltd.\n\"I just don't think Danone is a runner. It's just idle chatter. Unilever just does not want to go down the beer route or the packaging route and it does not want to hold a raft of businesses in France, Italy and Spain,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named.\nA more likely target for Unilever is CPC International, said analysts, the company has a large, fast moving, international consumer foods and baking business and some 60 percent of its sales outside the United States. CPC brands include Hellmann's Mayonnaise and Knor soups, Pot Noodles and Skippy peanut butter.\nUnilever chairman Niall Fitzgerald said at the time of the company's full year results earlier this month he hopes to conclude a sale in the next three to six months. He also said the sale was designed to \"de-clutter\" the group's portfolio and concentrate on key brands which include Persil detergent, Solero and Magnum ice-cream and Flora margarine as well as free up funds for expansion in emerging markets like South America and Asia Pacific.\nThe European foods business remains depressed against a weak economic background, poor consumer demand and tough competition.\n\"I don't think Danone has got enough eastern promise about it,\" said Michael Landymore analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite. \"It would put Unilever squarely back in Europe which it has said it trying to get out of in favour of developing markets,\" said Campbell.\nUnilever would also have to break up Danone to get its hands on the right business lines -- grocery, biscuits and water, said analysts.\n\"Unilever would have to break the company up because it would not want to keep the glass containers division or the beer division,\" said Campbell. \"It's also a flagship food company in France and it would be investigated under anti-trust legislation by the EC (European Commission),\" he added.\nThe EU has to clear a merger or acquisition involving a world-wide turnover of at least five billion ECU and a European turnover threshold of 250 million ECUs.\nAcquiring Danone would also stretch Unilever's resources, said analysts, who estimate the company has a warchest of about 10 billion stg after the sale of its speciality chemicals division. Danone, capitalised at about $10.8 billion, would probably fetch a price of about $15 billion, said analysts.\n-- London newsroom + 44 171 542 6437\n", "Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) said it set four new handling records during the territory's pre-Christmas peak season in December.\nHACTL managing director Anthony Charter told Reuters that imports were especially strong when new daily, weekly and monthly records were set.\nA new daily import handling record of 2,661 tonnes was set on December 26, according to HACTL's performance records.\n\"The daily tonnage record (for the after Christmas) is most unusual.

Surcharges pose a serious competitive threat to smaller banks, which have fewer automated teller machines, according to Edmund Mierzwinski, programme director at the non-profit U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n\"If enough small bank customers switch accounts to big banks to avoid surcharges, then the big banks, facing less competition, will raise the fees they charge their own customers even more,\" Mierzwinski said.\nAfter the hearing, banks denied the fees amount to double-dipping and argued consumers benefit from the proliferation of ATMs made possible by surcharge revenues.\n\"The marketplace is at work,\" said Ed Yingling, executive director of the American Bankers Association. \"Consumers, not the government, should decide if they are willing to pay for the convenience of using ATMs at thousands of new locations.\"\nIf surcharges are banned, many newly installed machines would be shuttered, Yingling said.\nUntil last year, the two largest ATM network operators, Mastercard International's Cirrus and Visa USA's Plus, generally prohibited banks from levying surcharges on non-customers. Banks received a portion of the fee on such transactions charged by the customer's own bank.\nLast April, Cirrus and Plus began allowing ATM surcharges, and the fees have rapidly proliferated. Fifteen states, including Texas, had previously allowed surcharges. More recently, Connecticut and Iowa have passed legislation banning surcharges.\nThe GAO found that about one-third of banks impose surcharges, covering 54 percent of all teller machines in the country. From the end of 1995 to February 1997, the number of ATMs rose 34 percent, while the number imposing a surcharge rose 320 percent, the GAO said.\nThe average surcharge was $1.14 in 1997, up from 99 cents in 1995.\nNot all the senators at Wednesday's hearing favoured legislation banning surcharges. Sen. Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, said he preferred allowing the market to set ATM fees.\n\"The ATM surcharge is a convenience fee,\" Faircloth said. \"That convenience comes at a price.\"\n", "GTE Corp, the one big local telephone company already able to offer long distance across much of the United States is being courted for alliances and mergers, but seems relatively self sufficient.\nAnalysts who attended a meeting with the company on Friday came away impressed by the list of suitors.\n\"They said they have been in merger and alliance talks with everyone from AT&amp;T (Corp) to WorldCom (Inc), but they didn't give the impression that talks had gone very far,\" said Barry Sine of brokers SBC Warburg. \nAnalysts were even more impressed by how well GTE expects it can do on its own and by the freedom from management distractions that such self-sufficiency offers.\nGTE forecast that earnings per share in 1997 and beyond would rise 10 percent a year or more, including a 1997 infusion of a third to half a billion dollars of long distance revenues. Telephone revenues in the U.S., where growth in customer lines has often been the best in the industry, were expected to grow 5-6 percent in 1997.\nGTE shares took a cue from the presentation, rising $0.50 on Friday and a further $3/8 to $44-5/8 by midday on Monday.  \n\"GTE made a very strong case that they don't need to merge with anyone,\" Sine said.\nGTE's local calling operations are like a shotgun blast on a map of the United States, peppering 28 states, but on average only accounting for 10 percent of lines in those states.\nRegional Bells by contrast blanket regions, which led to them being ruled dominant carriers under the terms of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, while GTE was not.  \nSo while regional Bells and long distance companies wrangle over the terms of competitive access to local customers, which must be agreed before regional Bells can enter the long distance market, GTE has already been operating long distance services since the spring.\n\"I think GTE is in a very good strategic position,\" said Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber.\nBy the end of the third quarter GTE had won over 500,000 customers from other carriers. By the end of 1996 it forecasts that it will have 750,000 and by end-1997 1.5 million.  \nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, GTE said it would increase long distance revenues seven-fold in 1997 from 1996. It gave no exact figure.\nGTE's fixed and wireless networks cover areas in which a third of the U.S. population live, but with an extension of 100 miles in each direction, would reach two thirds.\nNot only does this give network advantages, with few places far from a call switching center, but it means the GTE brand name is recognised very widely across the country.  \nAnalysts say brand name recognition is vital for companies that intend to bundle Internet and wireless with local and long distance calling.\nGTE has plenty to offer a partner. Its mainly rural and suburban customers are the hardest to reach by other means, putting a premium on its network.\nGTE's international operations, including investments in Venzuela, Argentina and the Dominican Republic, and a planned push into Brazil. Latin America is one of the hottest areas for telecom market growth in the world.\nGTE had its most serious merger talks with MCI Communications Corp analysts say. MCI was making the moves, but was disappointed that GTE was not prepared to offer more than $30 per share, according to news reports.\nNeither company has ever confirmed the talks nor the price. MCI eventually turned its merger attention to British Telecommunications Plc, which already had a 20 percent stake in MCI.\n-- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610\n", "A dispute over the future of civil liberties in Hong Kong moved into the diplomatic realm with Britain and the United States warning China to respect a treaty pledge to preserve basic freedoms.\nThe quarrel flared after a Beijing-controlled panel last Sunday proposed scrapping Hong Kong laws on civil liberties and elections, including part of its Bill of Rights, when China takes over Britain's last important colony five months from now.\nLondon and Washington issued stern warnings to Beijing, while China declared it was an internal affair and Hong Kong's future leader attempted to dampen the dispute.\nThe controversy is the latest over Chinese plans to scrap liberal political arrangements that Britain has introduced in Hong Kong in recent years.\nChina is also moving to install an appointed provisional legislature in place of the elected Legislative Council on July 1, and to block a lenient British law that would exclude China-style crackdowns on peaceful dissent and protests.\nChina's opponents say these steps fly in the face of commitments on allowing Hong Kong to keep its freedoms after it becomes a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.\nThe United States said on Tuesday it was deeply concerned about attempts to water down civil liberties in Hong Kong, and it called for reconsideration.\n\"We are deeply concerned over any attempt to weaken civil liberties and basic freedoms in Hong Kong,\" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.\nHong Kong's post-colonial leader, Tung Chee-hwa, who takes over from Governor Chris Patten on July 1, called for calm.\n\"I think we are being too dramatic,\" Tung told Hong Kong radio. \"It is a very complex issue,\" he said, adding that he would make a fuller statement on the affair on Thursday.\nBritain's minister for Hong Kong, Jeremy Hanley, summoned the Chinese ambassador in London to protest. A Foreign Office spokesman said the proposals were without justification.\nHe said the Bill of Rights was consistent both with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which is the treaty governing Hong Kong's handover, and with the Basic Law, the territory's post-handover constitution promulgated by China.\nThe issue was being hotly debated in Hong Kong newspapers, where some analysts predict a backlash if China rolls back basic freedoms in the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people.\n\"The Preparatory Committee's decision, if carried through, will certainly add to the number of political trials that greet the birth of the SAR,\" wrote political analyst C.K. Lau in the South China Morning Post.\n\"Should the outcome of those trials be politically unpopular, more and not fewer demonstrations and rallies are likely. This will be bad for Hong Kong's international image at a critical time.\"\n", "Lower U.S. retail prices and tighter profit margins have raised the performance bar for cereal brands, with those that fail to capture adequate market share quickly losing a spot on the grocery shelf.\n\"The cereal aisle is one of the most competitive aisles in the grocery store. As a result, to remain on the shelves, products have to meet increasingly high expectations,\" said Joseph Rutledge, a spokesman for General Mills Inc, the second largest U.S. cereal marker.  \nWhile cutting slow-selling products is a long-standing marketing practice, analysts and industry sources said the process has intensified.\n\"There is such intense scrunity on the grocery shelf -- what's moving and how fast is it selling -- that you are going to see a tremendous culling out of all these cereals,\" said Anne Tynion, president of North River Strategies Inc, a consumer and corporate brand consulting firm.\nIn 1995, General Mills axed Hidden Treasures and Sprinkle Spangles and launched Frosted Cheerios, its most successful new cereal. Rutledge said the events were unrelated.  \nThe weeding-out of stock-keeping units, or SKUs, is being done by both by cereal manufacturers and retailers, analysts said. In cereal, each variety and box-size is a separate SKU.\n\"There is evidence that companies are rationalizing their slower-moving, lower-market share SKUs,\" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said.\nFor cereal makers, the need to phase out slow-selling products has intensified with the recent cuts in retail prices, which have pressured profit margins. To make up for lost profits, cereal companies must focus attention on the best-sellers in the grocery store, analysts added.  \nPat Browne-Riso, a spokeswoman for number-three Post Cereal, a unit of Philip Morris Cos Inc, said elimination of poor sellers is a natural process driven by consumer demand.\n\"For example, if a certain size product is preferred over another, or as new products are introduced, we would (do) our best to optimize our space on the shelf as best as possible,\" Browne-Riso said.\nFor retailers, recent cutbacks in promotional spending by cereal makers -- such as offering discounts on wholesale purchases that may not be passed on entirely to consumers -- is prompting grocers to take a closer look at what is selling.  \n\"It comes back to the efforts of the manufacturers to roll back the promotional spending, which will provide the impetus for the retailers to exercise category management practices,\" SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said.\nScanner data, collected at the grocery check-out counter, has provided key information on cereal brand sales.\n\"It (scanning) has totally changed the grocery environment,\" Tynion of North River Strategies said.\nKellogg Co, the top U.S. cereal maker, declined to comment on its marketing strategies.\n-- Reuters Chicago Newsdesk - 312-408-8787\n", "British insurance and asset management giant Prudential Corp Plc on Wednesday beat analysts' forecasts with an eight percent rise in first half profits to 421.0 million pounds ($655 million).\nPrudential chief executive Peter Davis said the company wanted to buy a home loan lender to build its customer base but he refused to be drawn on which building society, if any, the Prudential was talking to.\n\"We are interested in buying a building society but for its branch network and its customer base rather than its mortgage book,\" Davis said in an interview.\nThe Prudential, which next month will launch a telephone banking business, raised its interim dividend by 9.4 percent to 5.8 pence per share.\nThe first-half data included 33 million pounds of start-up costs for the new banking operation, which chief executive Peter Davis said was on course for launch on October 1.\nDavis said the life insurance business was benefiting from a general upturn in consumer confidence in Britain.\n\"Customers are feeling a little more confident and are more willing to make commitments.\"\nBut Davis noted that single contribution products were still showing far more growth than those that require a longer-term commitment or regular contributions.\nPrudential's single contribution sales rose by 50 percent in the first half of the year compared with a gain of 15 percent for regular contribution sales.\nDavis said the personal pensions industry had still not completely thrown off the stigma of a private pensions scandal in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said consumers were starting to realise they must make adequate pension provision.\nPrudential said funds under management had risen by four percent since the end of 1995 to 85 billion pounds. Profit from this business rose to 14 million pounds from eight million in the first half of last year.\nDavis hoped there would be no lasting knock-on effect on the fund management industry from recent events at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), but said the affair was sure to make investors look closely at the standing of the institution with which they have their money invested.\n\"It's likely to be a swings and roundabouts thing,\" Davis said. \"There will probably be a general loss of confidence but we will also see some flight to quality and security.\"\nMGAM last week suspended three of its unit trust funds for three days after the discovery of alleged irregularities but trade resumed after a casj injection from the company's German parent Deutsche Bank.

We feel that we are going to easily achieve that goal,\" Bharti told analysts during a conference call on Tuesday.\nGold production in 1996 was an annualized 100,000 ounces of gold with an average cash cost of US$349 per ounce. William Resources made three acquisitions last year which pushed it into the ranks of intermediate gold producers.\nThe Bjorkdal mine in Sweden, acquired in December 1996, is expected to exceed 100,000 ounces in 1997 at a cash cost of US$216 per ounce.\nIn Brazil, the Jacobina project is forecast this year at 65,000 ounces of gold at a cash cost of US$285 per ounce.\nBharti said the current downturn in gold prices and depressed stock prices due to the Bre-X Minerals Ltd controversy has undermined investor confidence.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's gold index was off 233 points on Tuesday as COMEX gold futures sank over US$5 an ounce.\n\"We've got gold at US$345 (an ounce) this morning. Stocks with the Bre-X issue are really struggling. There's a huge malaise in the gold market where people are wondering if gold is a good investment,\" Bharti said.\nBut William Resources is in good shape with 90 percent of its gold hedged at over US$374 per ounce, he said.\nBharti added that cash flow from operations of US$25 million in 1997 gives the company the enough flexibility \"if this market gets any worse.\"\nHe said the company could also defer some capital spending. About US$15 million of William's US$20 million capital budget in 1997 is discretionary.\nLooking at individual projects, Bharti said bulk testing at the Ballarat East gold project in Australia should be completed by the end of this month.\n\"I can say the results to date...we're finding some very exciting nuggets in Ballarat that certainly we had not expected,\" Bharti said.\nThe outlook was less favorable for Ruster's Roost where a feasibility study indicated the project would need gold prices of around US$400 an ounce to be viable.\nBharti said plant construction would continue until July, but future spending would be deferred after that.\n\"We would really like to see in this present gold market what the price of gold is and how the overall market performs before we put the propellers on Ruster's Roost,\" he said.\nIn Mexico, the Velardena project is up for sale following a disappointing performance last year. William Resources took a C$3.5 million writedown on the project in the three months ended December 31, 1996.\n\"We've been approached by two or three companies that are focused on Mexico and interested in buying Valedania and we are in advanced negotiaitons with these companies,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, the company said first quarter 1997 gold production exceeded 47,000 ounces at a cash cost of US$295 per ounce. The results were slightly under budget due to poor weather at Ruster's Roost in January, Bharti said.\nHe said financial results for the first quarter will be released before the company's annual meeting on May 14. At the meeting, shareholders will vote on a proposed one for three stock consolidation.\n((Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100))\n", "The Toronto stock market ended mixed in heavy dealings on Friday but the key index managed to remain above the key 6,200 points level despite some profit-taking by investors.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index slipped 11.84 points to close at 6214.24.

The first part has gone quicker than I could have hoped, but it has cost a lot of money.\"\nTaylor said BZW would continue to incur quite high costs in the first half of the current year and would then face the disruption of moving its offices to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands.\n\"I would hope that the second half would be a lot better,\" he added.\n", "A second wave of Chinese soldiers arrived in Hong Kong on Monday to prepare garrison facilities before Beijing takes back the territory from Britain on July 1.\nSixty-six uniformed but unarmed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) drove into Hong Kong in a fleet of 14 staff vehicles from the Chinese border city of Shenzhen.\nMonday's group was the second PLA contingent in as many months to arrive in the territory under arrangements worked out by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group overseeing details of Hong Kong's sovereignty change.\nForty soldiers entered on April 21 to prepare logistics and facilities before the eventual arrival on July 1 of the rest of the Chinese troops to be stationed in the territory.\nMajor-General Liu Zhenwu, commander of the future garrison in Hong Kong, officiated a solemn send-off ceremony on the Chinese side of the border, according to the official Chinese Xinhua news agency.\nLiu urged the advance party \"to carry on the fine traditions of the PLA, and to perform the sacred duties entrusted to them by the country and people\".\nA handful of British soldiers and Chinese officers from the first advance group greeted the latest contingent on the Hong Kong side in a brief and low-key ceremony.\nSporting dark blue berets and crisply-starched uniforms, the 66 PLA troops crossed over at 1.00 p.m. (0500 GMT) in a convoy comprising a large air-conditioned bus, green army trucks, jeeps and black Audi cars.\nHong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to China on July 1 and the British garrison is already packing up ahead of its departure at midnight June 30.\nFrom July 1, the bustling capitalist city of 6.4 million will be guarded by the PLA.\nAfter the brief greetings, the British soldiers then climbed aboard the Chinese vehicles to help give directions to the Sek Kong military camp in the New Territories.\nBesides Sek Kong, the latest group will be stationed in the Prince of Wales Barracks, Stonecutters Island and Gun Club Hill Barracks, a Hong Kong government spokesman said.\nA third and final advance guard of 90 soliders is scheduled to arrive on May 30, bringing the total preparatory force of Chinese troops in Hong Kong to 196 before the handover.\nMany Hong Kong people are concerned about the presence of PLA troops in the territory because of the bloody military crackdown on activists in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.\nChina plans to station some 10,000 troops in the territory after the handover, about the same number as the British garrison at its peak.\nBut the Chinese officers have been careful to make sure that the troops who have already arrived are keeping a low profile.\n", "Pop singer Michael Jackson came to Prague on Tuesday to launch his first tour in two years as promoters erected a huge statue of the star on a hill over the city where a monument to Soviet boss Josef Stalin once stood.\nJackson's three-month \"HIStory\" tour through Europe, Africa and Asia kicks off on Saturday with a concert on Prague's Letna Plain where 130,000 are expected, but he arrived four days early to do some sightseeing in and around the Czech capital.\nAfter his jet sat for half an hour on the tarmac of Prague airport's VIP terminal, the flamboyant but reclusive Jackson emerged in a gold lame and red outfit under a white parasol blocking the bright sun.\nSeveral hundred fans handpicked by promoters greeted the star, and he hugged several fans who presented gifts on the tarmac before Jackson's motorcade left.\nAfter waving at others lining the 15 km (10 mile) route into the city from a gleaming Rolls Royce, Jackson and his police-escorted phalynx of luxury cars carrying his entourage drove through a screaming hotel welcoming party.\nThousands of fans amassed at the hotel on the river Vltava (Moldau), climbing over each other for a glimpse of the star on his first tour since he was cleared of child molestation charges by a U.S. court because of lack of evidence.\nPavel Klika, in his late teens from the southern Czech city of Tabor, played a human \"K\" in a seven-member group spelling out J-A-C-K-S-O-N for his arrival.\n\"I had to come here to see him to really beleive he was in the Czech Republic, even though I have a ticket to see him on Saturday -- I just couldn't wait,\" Klika said.\nThe singer's penthouse suite Prague faces the hill where a 10-metre (33 foot) water-filled statue of Jackson takes up the rock pedastal where Communists built a massive monument to Stalin which they later blew up up after his death in 1953.\nDespite complaints about the Jackson statue in some quarters, Prague City Hall finally approved its placement until the concert is completed on Saturday.\nTwo huge torches on either side of Jackson's statue were lit recalling the days when Stalin's Cult of Personality kept two Olympic-style flames burning.\nThe Prague stop, Jackson's first visit to the Czech capital in a long series of rock concerts since the fall of Communism here in 1989, has so far avoided the controversy at other planned dates on his tour.\nIn South Korea, civic and religious groups reacted bitterly to a decision to let Jackson play two concerts in Seoul in October, saying it was unbelievable that the government agreed to to make an \"amoral singer\" the teenagers' idol.\nA planned stop in Casablanca was cancelled by Moroccan authorities, without explanation. A concert organiser said the government did not want 100,000 youths all in the same place.\n"], "label": ["NickLouth", "NickLouth", "AaronPressman", "PatriciaCommins", "LydiaZajc", "TheresePoletti",
